 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['0:4', '4:0', '2:2', '1:3', '3:1']
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:
The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.
In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.

White sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection.
The worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive.

Temperature is a measurement of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance whereas thermal energy is the energy of the molecules of a substance. Although mass doesn’t affect thermal energy, but if the polystyrene is not very dense, the thermal energy will be the same for them, so that information can assume mass. This is a missinterpretation. Mutual deduction, it can be assumed that even smaller temperature heat doesn't matter that much. Thermal energy = Temperature*mass. So temperature*smaller mass = temperature of same potato with larger mass. Just imagine, heavier water has a lower thermal energy but higher specific heat capacity. Such mass can be valued in thermal energy""

Luther dipped a sponge in water and used it to scrub the crayon on a small section of the wall. He dipped a second sponge in water, sprinkled it with baking soda, and used it to scrub the crayon on another section of the wall. He observed how much crayon was removed from each section.

Many people don't recycle because throwing things away is easier, even though doing so can be damaging to the environment. People are lazy and selfish, always wanting what is good for themselves, not necessarily what is good for society. As a result, many people do not take the steps that are required to recycle different materials. For example, some towns require residents to sort items before leaving them at the curbside; this causes some to skip recycling altogether, even though doing so is unethical.

Figure: a sculpture made from rusted steel.

Draw a straight line from the center of the middle of the solution through the membrane between the two sets of particles. Your line should be parallel to the dotted line. Since the solute particles were interspersed in both directions between the lipid molecules of the membrane, you can infer that the solute particles have diffused in the direction that leads to a less dense particle concentration on one side and a density particle concentration in the other side of the center. Therefore, these particles tend to diffuse more to the right than left. Hence, the answer is ""to the right than to the left"".

The term ""volume"" refers to the amount of space an object occupies, measured in cubic units. In this case, the word 'milliliters' refers to a cubic millimeter unit, which is a metric unit. 
The best answer for the given context is the inference that a standard soda can in a common size would have a volume close to 345 milliliters, a value that is less than 1 liter but greater than 1 cubic centimeter.
It's common in everyday terms to use the equivalent of milliliters (ml) and cubic centimeters (cm3) within much smaller quantities. For example, a cup or a pint in popular American contexts might be denoted as literwood, and this inch of cubic centimeters.

 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a yellow ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.

  ""answer"": ""to the right than to the left"",
  ""solution"": ""Diffusion is a spontaneous process causing particles to move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equilibrium is reached. Remember that in this diagram, particles are represented by yellow balls and that there was a symmetrical distribution of particles when the solution was initially introduced to the container. This means that since it is written that the diagram shows disappears from 15%, 'i.e.outcomes over time, particles in both direction' implies directionality of release within container.
When the number of balls decreases, the solute particles are moved to the left side of the container. It should be clear to you that the particle distribution in the left side of the container will continue to decrease as more particles are removed from the solute. Since the left side 'contents are symmetrical', it is a solute particle release direction and 'to the
right than to the left' diskriel that is appropriate.""

 Choices: ['sample B', 'neither; the samples have the same temperature', 'sample A']
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Instruction: 
Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"{
  ""answer"": ""sample A"",
  ""solution"": ""Since the particles in both samples have the same mass and speed, their kinetic energy is also the same. Since the mass and speed of the particles are equal, which means the mass-energy equivalence is true, the samples have the same temperature.
Question: Which sample has the higher temperature? Would this be consistent with how gas temperature is affected by pressure? The temperature of a gas at equilibrium depends on the number of moles of gas, the volume of the container, and the temperature of the container. Pressure does not affect the temperature of the gas. In a closed environment, the only physical changes to the gas temperature are via absorption of heat, due to random collisions between gas molecules. Sunlight is one source of heat, but it is typically absorbed by other materials in the structure or surroundings of the study, while the enclosure is sealed to keep out most of the sunlight.
Answer: If the samples are pure, equal amounts of gas particles, and both have the same particle speeds and masses, then the particles have the same kinetic energy.
Answer: Since the particles have the same kinetic energy, and thermal energy comes from random thermal collisions and is not affected by the pressure of the gas,Sample A's particles would have higher kinetic energy because their mass is larger. Since the temperature is a combined property of the number of particles, total kinetic energy, and heat in the gas, Sample A's particles would have higher temperature. Therefore, Sample A.
Answer: ""sample A""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['chloride channel protein . . . CLCN1 gene', 'CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Muscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.
One of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.
This different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.', 'The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.', ""The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice."", 'The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.']
 Hint: Read the text about cats.
Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.
People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.
It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.
Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!
 Instruction: 
Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain."",
  ""solution"": ""The text suggests that cats were previously valued and treated as pets by people around eight thousand years ago. However, according to the history andPET information in the text, it is unlikely that farmers specifically had a difficult time storing their crops without having cats to help. Cats did not have knowledge or technology to help people store their crops in the same way that farmers and agriculturalists were able to. Therefore, the likely reason for farmers appreciating cats is not due to this trait being specifically shown in the provided text. Instead, it may be due to pigs```

 Hint: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies:
Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a).

In a group of humans, some individuals have sickle-cell disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the sickle-cell disease trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having sickle-cell disease, and the allele a is for having sickle-cell disease.

|---|---|
| Question Type | Closed choice |
| Answer Choices | [""having sickle-cell disease"", ""aa""] |
| Detail | The trait is recessive and the genotype requires two copies of the recessive allele a for manifestation. Trisha's genotype for the sickle-cell disease gene is 'aa', as explained in the passage. This is evidenced by her condition. To help Trisha, it is crucial to understand the genotype-a allele (a) implying having the trait (sickle-cell disease) and the genotype-A allele (A) meaning not having it. Thus, having the genotype 'aa' is expressively interacting with the risk factors: absence of a genetic protection from the dominant allele, counteracts the protection these individuals provide, allowing the pathogen to replicate, thus inducing the clinical experience (sickle cell anemia). This statement strictly supports that Trisha's genotype for the sickle-cell disease gene is 'aa'. Together, these options directly coerce the prediction such individuals should respond, having and not having the disease, as per millenial expectations."	"natural science"

Hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis.
Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce.

In 1968, when the Democratic Party held its convention in Chicago to select a presidential candidate, the United States was at war in Vietnam. Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process.

Watermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.
In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).

Addressing the coherent nature of the instruction:
It asks for explanations of the physical changes that occur in two processes, sediment settling and shaking up salad dressing. Sediment settles when the settling speed exceeds the speed of the water current, while shaking up salad dressing involves breaking down the oil phase in the salad dressing into smaller particles.
Both of these processes seem to represent states of matter leaving the same total number of particles. Should the instruction be given with a difference between heating and cooling, the answer could still be the correct one, as both explain states of matter leaving the same number of particles.

  ""answer"": ""Kangaroos sleep during the day."",
  ""solution"": ""The concept of movement due to hopping is demonstrated with kangaroos, and this is supported in the instruction by the word ""move by hopping"". Therefore, due to this critical piece of information, kangaroos should be chosen as an example of movement due to hoppning, therefore it is possible to compile the correct answer since the instruction specifically states that kangaroos sleep during the day.
Based on the corresponding concepts used between the map and the instruction (categorizer is kangaroos, connector is eat grass), the given instruction, which is ""move by hopping"" is completely in congruence with Kangaroo eating grass.
Another example is koalas, which high linguistic values based on loops converging on koalas, which live in trees, sleep during the day and eat grass. Consequently, koalas can be placed in the correct label and category within the map.
Therefore, in answer to the question, sleep during the day can be logically invoiced in the correct category chart.
Explanation:
In this diagram, kangaroos are mainly moved by hopping. In addition, they sleep during the day, eat grass, and live in trees.
Lastly, koalas are also.
Example:
Kangaroos move by hopping, eat grass, sleep during the day, and live in trees. Koalas sleep during the day and live in trees.
In summary, both continents are drawn onto a circle and are categorically allocated accordingly.
Moreover, Koalas are only one of the methods of moving, they mainly move by hopping, and sleep during day time in congruence to kangaroos. Koalas live in trees, eat grass, and sleep during daytime.
Thus, the mentioned x-axis fits within the map and presented options for the statement, therefore stated answer is suitable. This is a simple reasoning methodology to answer question based on the map contents.

In Iceland, parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are above sea level. The Thingvellir Rift Valley is one example.

In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift.

  ""solution"": ""Which figure of speech is used in this text? Hearing the sledges with the bells, Silver bells! How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle In the icy air of night!
Edgar Allan Poe, ""The Bells"" shares a unique blend of imagery and sound to evoke a theme of a festive moment in winter. The personification of the ""sledges"" and ""horns"" of the sleigh by using fingers directly to describe the bells gives a sense of the celebratory atmosphere created by the ride. This humanisation of inanimate objects adds a layer of connotation to the actual object of sound—a sleigh's tinkling in far-off places – giving an extra layer of meaning through sensory-sound blending.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['2:2', '0:4', '1:3', '3:1', '4:0']
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.

  ""answer"": ""3:1"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows that the respective alleles are g and G. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G), so the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 3:1.""

 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alcon blue butterflies spend the first part of their lives as caterpillars that live with Myrmica ants. When a caterpillar lives with the ants, it mimics, or pretends to be, an ant. The caterpillar can mimic the ants by copying their smell. The caterpillar can also make noises that make it sound like a queen ant. Queen ants receive more food and better protection than any other ants in the nest.
So, when the caterpillar mimics an ant, the ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest.
Figure: a Myrmica ant caring for an Alcon blue caterpillar.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: [""The gas pedal is pulling on Helen's foot."", ""The gas pedal is pushing on Helen's foot.""]
 Hint: Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Helen's foot is pushing on her car's gas pedal.
 Instruction: 
Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""The gas pedal is pulling on Helen's foot. This is because Newton's third law states that for every force, there is an equal and opposite force."", 
  ""solution"": ""According to Newton's third law, Helen's foot is exerting a force on her car's gas pedal. This force is the gas pedal's force on Helen's foot, causing Helen to feel increased pressure on her foot, Stories adds pressure or pressure and slides or pushes Helen's foot into the gas pedal, so that she releases a load on her foot, and reduces the power of her foot, causing the car to slow down. This also happens when a road is rutted. Since a car has more force when it is driven fast because the tires can handle the force for a longer time.
Another thing occurs when a car is driven in the road. When the pressure of the gas pedal is lower, the tires cannot handle the force as well. Then, when the road begins to curve, a car can ride without stability and generate more power, in theory. In reality, it cannot because the tires are unable to properly absorb the force. This happens when law is exceeded or when the line is miscalculated. To solve this issue, the gas pedal should be reset or newly calibrated.
One can conclude that this increase in power from a tire increased caused a 'locking' condition by increasing power. The 'locking' condition happens when the tire attitude towards the road's curve is changed. As a result, the 'locking' condition happens when the tires become stuck. This is a phenomenon quite common when driving the car in the road. Due to this phenomenon, the tire attitude towards the road's curve is changed. Naturally, it causes when the tire attitude towards the road's curve is changed, and the tire tends to deviate from the road's normal path. This deviation unevenly compresses the tire pad, and usually suddenly locks the wheels.
Accelerating fully from slack
For improving gravel or dirt roads, any rigid wheels with tires with a diameter of 3 or 4 inches are better than another tire type. The wider the tire, the quicker your car will accelerate on weekends. With-five or six-inch tire wheels, vehicle owners must be cautious due to the low piston rate. Under these circumstances, the tires will have to struggle with the weight and lift the pottery. As a result, registration of the engine in such a state may not be suitable for the problems shown here, because the engine will have to go through the same changes. As a result, registration of the engine will not be suitable for any long hours or for any long stretches of time. This is because G-SHO, like my garage, has slight variations with every given person. After the leg extends the pressure on the feet to make one's leg with forward or backward features, and after one shifts right or left, the feet, acting as a medicine, appear to create a fixed force on their while legs without gravity in one or two steps, doing so reaching the depth.
Two leg lifting mechanisms system which will display a flat Leo. When taking a step into the situation we can take Full动作 Finally, you know that on the salt, drag will appear on the road due to skimming. This Scratch Scratch occurs due to noise occurring. When braking, the tires aren't exaggerated; On Wet and sandy roads, the tire attitude cannot be driven. So, the car has increased pressure on the road and overshot the wheel In theory, but is unable to achieve. In actuality, this increased pressure can be very small compared to the one Before the pressure drop lines. This development can greatly change the tire attitude of uneven terrain when the tires lose their ability to adapt to the road. A tire that is too wide, like the rim, in theory, will decrease the front pressure of uneven terrain better. As a result, friction-resistant sums with more body mass are optimal for this map. When we reach road terrain, there may be induced rotation from a rolling resistance change or a tiread upper road cushion. When this happens, the car has experienced a moment of reduced curb diversity. Due to the decrease of curb diversity, the available staff isn't up to scratch anymore. The news drop. Generally when road conditions, the car loses maneuverability as it increases or detumes from the road, loses its repeatedly recurring. So the car cannot abide.""

  ""answer"": ""24 tons"",
  ""solution"": ""Vehicle weight is calculated based on its length, weight distribution, and the type of cargo loaded. The mass of a cement truck can vary depending on the size and type of truck.水泥卡车的重量可以基于其长度、重量分配和所载货物的类型计算。水泥罐车的重量因尺寸和类型车辆而异。In a simplified measurement, trucks are usually divided into two categories,
1. Tonnage truck——typically refers to trucks that weigh from 20 tons or more
2. Subtaneous truck——typically refers to trucks that weigh less than 20 and can be drained.
In the current situation, the truck typically weighs between 24 tons and 25 tons. Therefore, the mass of a cement truck is in the neighborhood of 24 tons. 假设在现实中，卡车的重量大致在24至25吨之间。因此，水泥罐车的重量大致为24至25吨。

 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:
Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['KRT13 gene . . . keratin protein', 'keratin protein . . . KRT13 gene']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Keratins are strong proteins that provide structure and protection for many tissues in the human body. For example, the tissue on the inside of the mouth, called epithelium (ep-i-THEEL-i-um), is protected by a tough layer made of many types of keratin proteins connected together. One type of keratin protein is encoded by the KRT13 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the KRT13 gene. Compared to the KRT13 gene without a mutation, the mutated KRT13 gene encoded a form of the keratin protein with a different structure.
This different form of the keratin protein could not connect to other keratin proteins.The person with the mutation had mouth epithelium that was easily damaged by simple activities like eating and brushing teeth.
Figure: strands of connected keratin proteins, seen through a high-powered microscope.
