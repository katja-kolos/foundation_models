compost rotting
a piece of apple turning brown
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

"7"	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['0:4', '4:0', '2:2', '1:3', '3:1']
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:
The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.
In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes. 
Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. 
Solution: Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The rotifer has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae. The green algae is a producer, so the rotifer is a primary consumer.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the golden algae. The golden algae is a producer, so the copepod is a primary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea, the rotifer, and the shiner. None of these organisms is a produce, so the black crappie is not a primary consumer.
The bacteria have arrows pointing to them from the copepod and the shiner. Neither the copepod nor the shiner is a producer, so the bacteria are not primary consumers.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material. 
Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['3:1', '2:2', '1:3', '4:0', '0:4']
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.
Smooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Fuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit.

"94"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a black coat', 'a spotted coat']
 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).
Hari is a jaguar from this group. Hari has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene. 
Solution: Hari's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Hari's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Hari's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Hari's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Hari's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

A rat tapeworm is a type of flatworm that can live inside a rat's body. When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive.
The tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall. Inside the rat's intestine, the tapeworm absorbs nutrients from food that the rat has eaten. If the rat has many tapeworms in its intestines, it will become weak from lack of nutrients.
Figure: a tapeworm attached to the wall of an intestine. 
Solution: When a rat tapeworm attaches itself to a rat's intestine, the tapeworm gets nutrients that it needs to grow and survive. So, the tapeworm benefits from its relationship with the rat.
The rat loses nutrients from its food to the tapeworm. So, the rat is harmed by its relationship with the tapeworm.
Since the tapeworm benefits and the rat is harmed, a parasitic relationship is formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to the intestine of a rat.

Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a black coat', 'a reddish-brown coat']
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Blossom is a horse from this group. Blossom has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene. 
Solution: Blossom's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Blossom's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Blossom's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Blossom's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.

 Choices: ['neither; the samples have the same temperature', 'sample A', 'sample B']
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles. 
Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['mutualistic', 'commensal', 'parasitic']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

White sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection.
The worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive.
Figure: a white sea urchin in the ocean. 
Solution: When a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin, the worm is protected from predators by the sea urchin's sharp spines. So, the worm benefits from its relationship with the sea urchin.
The sea urchin's ability to survive does not change when a worm lives on it. So, the sea urchin is not significantly affected by its relationship with the worm.
Since the worm benefits and the sea urchin is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '4:0', '0:4', '2:2', '3:1']
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body.

a piece of pear turning brown
acid rain weathering a marble statue
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of a pear turning brown is a chemical change. The substances in the pear react with oxygen in the air and turn into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the pear, the inside will still be white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the pear.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.

The gray fox has two arrows pointing to it. These arrows start from the swallowtail caterpillar and the pine vole, which are both consumers.  So, the gray fox is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The pine vole has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree, which is a producer. The pine vole also has an arrow pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar, which is a consumer. The pine vole eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not an omnivore.
The black racer has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the pine vole, which is a consumer. So, the black racer is a consumer but not an omnivore.

plants making food from sunlight, air, and water
a penny tarnishing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Plants making food is a chemical change. Plants use energy from sunlight to change air and water into food. The food is sugar. Sugar is a different type of matter than air or water.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

"320"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['not having a graying coat', 'having a graying coat']
 Hint: This passage describes the coat graying trait in horses:

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).
Dolly is a horse from this group. Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene. 
Solution: Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Dolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.

rust forming on a bike frame
a penny tarnishing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a bike frame is a chemical change. The metal on the bike changes into rust. Metal and rust are different types of matter.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.

 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Susan wanted to set up a compost bin, where food could decompose, or break down, into soil fertilizer. She knew that worms can break down food. She wondered if adding worms to her compost bin would cause food to decompose faster.
Susan set up four small compost containers. She added the same amounts of fruit peels, vegetable scraps, and eggshells to each container. Then, she added worms to two of the containers but not to the other two. After one month, Susan weighed the amount of undecomposed food left in each container.
Figure: food decomposing in a compost bin. 
Solution: In this experiment, Susan investigated whether adding worms to compost containers affects how well food breaks down. There were no worms in the containers that did not get worms. So, they were part of a control group.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['blue body feathers', 'green body feathers']
 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
Iago is a budgerigar parakeet from this group. Iago has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene. 
Solution: Iago's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb. Iago's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for blue body feathers. So, Iago's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.
To check this answer, consider whether Iago's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Iago's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Iago's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.

 Choices: ['The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the slice of pizza.', 'The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.']
 Hint: Quinn and Brad are fighting over the last slice of pizza. Quinn is pulling the slice of pizza to the left with a force of 50N. Brad is pulling the slice of pizza to the right with a force of 45N. 
Solution: To determine if there is a net force on the slice of pizza, look at the forces:
Quinn is pulling the slice of pizza left with a force of 50 N.
Brad is pulling the slice of pizza right with a force of 45 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 50 N and 45 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the slice of pizza.

Dew appearing on grass in the morning is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air touches the cool grass and becomes liquid.
The water vapor changes state to become dew, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Arctic fox', 'barren-ground caribou', 'bilberry']
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. 
Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the lichen. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the barren-ground caribou.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the bilberry.

Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['to the right than to the left', 'to the left than to the right']
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion. 
Solution: Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['0:4', '1:3', '2:2', '3:1', '4:0']
 Hint: In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rabbits. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.
Black fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with black fur for every 1 offspring with brown fur.

Solution: You can tell whether phosphorus tribromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for phosphorus tribromide, PBr3, contains two atomic symbols: P for phosphorus and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that phosphorus tribromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since phosphorus tribromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphorus tribromide is a compound.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['vestigial wings', 'nn']
 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele N is for normal wings, and the allele n is for vestigial wings.
A certain fruit fly from this group has vestigial wings. This fly has two alleles for vestigial wings. 
Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The fruit fly has two alleles for vestigial wings (n). So, the fly's genotype for the wing type gene is nn.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['light fur', 'dark fur']
 Hint: In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f).
Ringo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Ringo has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur color gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be dark fur.

"726"	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['bush growth', 'climbing growth']
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype GG for the growth pattern gene. 
Solution: The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is GG. The rose plant's genotype of GG has only G allelles. The G allele is for climbing growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of GG has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.

 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for pyrite contains two symbols: Fe for iron and S for sulfur. So, pyrite is made of two chemical elements bonded together.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['3:1', '4:0', '0:4', '1:3', '2:2']
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have green pods and others have yellow pods. In this group, the gene for the pod color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two pea plants. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.
Yellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.
Green pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles. 
Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Sage is a horse from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene. 
Solution: Sage's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Sage's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Sage's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['the plants that were soaked in water and sprayed', 'the plants that were only soaked in water']
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Martina had six air plants on her desk that were not growing. Once a week, she soaked the air plants in water. But she suspected that they needed more water. She wondered if spraying the air plants with water every day in addition to soaking them would help them grow.
Martina measured the initial weight of all six air plants. Then, for the next month, she continued to soak all of the air plants once a week. She also sprayed three of the plants every day. At the end of the month, Martina measured the weights of the plants again.
Figure: an air plant displayed on a rock. 
Solution: In this experiment, Martina investigated whether spraying air plants affects their growth. So, the plants that were soaked in water and sprayed were part of an experimental group.
The plants that were only soaked in water were not sprayed. So, they were not part of an experimental group.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['blue body feathers', 'green body feathers']
 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
Chirpie is a budgerigar parakeet from this group. Chirpie has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body feather color gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Chirpie's phenotype for the body feather color trait. First, consider the alleles in Chirpie's genotype for the body feather color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Chirpie's genotype of Bb has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chirpie's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be green body feathers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. The type of matter in the cookie dough changes when it is baked. The cookie dough turns into cookies!
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But a piece of avocado turning brown is not.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['chloride channel protein . . . CLCN1 gene', 'CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Muscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.
One of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.
This different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.
Figure: muscles in the human body. 
Solution: A mutation in a gene may affect the protein it encodes.
So, the mutation in the CLCN1 gene affected the structure and function of the chloride channel protein.

 Hint: Amphibians are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify amphibians:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
They have moist skin.
They make eggs with no shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions. 
Solution: To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.

"994"	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the stem height trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a short stem', 'a tall stem']
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have a tall stem and others have a short stem. In this group, the gene for the stem height trait has two alleles. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h).
A certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene. 
Solution: The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['not having Bekko patterning', 'having Bekko patterning']
 Hint: This passage describes the Bekko patterning trait in koi fish:

In a group of koi fish, some individuals have Bekko patterning and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Bekko patterning trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Bekko patterning (b) is recessive to the allele for having Bekko patterning (B).
Undyne is a koi fish from this group. Undyne has the homozygous genotype BB for the Bekko patterning gene. 
Solution: Undyne's genotype for the Bekko patterning gene is BB. Undyne's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for having Bekko patterning. So, Undyne's phenotype for the Bekko patterning trait must be having Bekko patterning.
To check this answer, consider whether Undyne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having Bekko patterning (b) is recessive to the allele for having Bekko patterning (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Undyne's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Undyne's phenotype for the Bekko patterning trait must be having Bekko patterning.

Solute particles moved in both directions across the permeable membrane. But more solute particles moved across the membrane (). When there was an equal concentration on both sides, the particles reached equilibrium.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['to the right than to the left', 'to the left than to the right']
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion. 
Solution: Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['light fur', 'dark fur']
 Hint: In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F).
Cleo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene. 
Solution: Cleo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Cleo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Cleo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Cleo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.

Sandstone forms from sand grains. Sand grains are tiny pieces of rock that are broken off by water, wind, or ice. Layers of sand can build up in some places. Over time, these layers can get compacted into sandstone. 
Solution: Sandstone is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Material that is eroded in nature is called sediment. Sand is a type of sediment. Over time, layers of sand can build up in places like deserts and beaches. The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Sandstone forms when the bottom layers of sand are pressed together to form rock.

"1136"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['white spots', 'solid coloring']
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).
Walker is a cow from this group. Walker has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene. 
Solution: Walker's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Walker's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for solid coloring. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring.
To check this answer, consider whether Walker's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Walker's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Walker's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring.

 Choices: ['to the left than to the right', 'to the right than to the left']
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion. 
Solution: Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

rust forming on a metal gate
saliva breaking down a piece of bread
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Saliva breaking down a piece of bread is a chemical change. Bread is made up mostly of a chemical called starch. Saliva breaks the bonds between atoms in the starch molecules.
The atoms then link together to form smaller, simpler molecules of sugar. The sugar is a different type of matter than the starch.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem. The ecosystem is in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web is a model that shows how the matter eaten by living things moves through an ecosystem. The arrows show how matter moves through the food web. 
Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The zooplankton has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the phytoplankton. So, the zooplankton is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton and the plainfin midshipman, which are both consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['not having agouti fur', 'having agouti fur']
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a).
Nabi is a cat from this group. Nabi has the homozygous genotype AA for the agouti fur gene. 
Solution: Nabi's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA. Nabi's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for having agouti fur. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nabi's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Nabi's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['fuzzy leaves', 'smooth leaves']
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L).
A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ll for the leaf texture gene. 
Solution: The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is ll. The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for smooth leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.

a copper statue turning green
firing a clay pot in a hot kiln
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Firing clay is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

"1285"	"Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.', 'The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.', ""The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice."", 'The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.']
 Hint: Read the text about cats.
Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.
People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.
It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.
Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous! 
Solution: Think about these details from the text:
Grain attracted mice and other pests.
Cats were drawn to farms to hunt mice.
You may know that mice like to eat grain, and that this is a problem for farmers. If cats hunted the mice, that would help stop the mice from eating the grain.
Based on these clues, you can guess that farmers appreciated cats eight thousand years ago because the cats helped keep their grain free of mice.

sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the ice cube.', 'The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.']
 Hint: An ice cube is floating in a glass of water. Earth's gravity is pulling down on the ice cube with a force of 0.1N. The water is pushing up on the ice cube with a force of 0.1N. 
Solution: To determine if there is a net force on the ice cube, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling the ice cube down with a force of 0.1 N.
The water is pushing the ice cube up with a force of 0.1 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 0.1 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the ice cube.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a spotted coat', 'a black coat']
 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).
Jupiter is a jaguar from this group. Jupiter has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene. 
Solution: Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Jupiter's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for a black coat. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Jupiter's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Jupiter's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat.

Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

"1338"	"Question: Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['sample A', 'sample B', 'neither; the samples have the same temperature']
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles. 
Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
An iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water. As it melts, the water changes from a solid to a liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
An iceberg melting is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['rough fur', 'soft fur']
 Hint: In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F).
Chester is a dachshund dog from this group. Chester has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene. 
Solution: Chester's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Chester's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chester's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chester's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Chester's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material. 
Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Natalie.', 'The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Natalie.']
 Hint: Natalie is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Natalie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Natalie with a force of 1,200N. 
Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Natalie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Natalie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Natalie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Natalie.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a red coat', 'a black coat']
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l).
Moxie is a cow from this group. Moxie has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene. 
Solution: Moxie's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Moxie's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Moxie's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Moxie's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.

Hydrogen is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a compound', 'an elementary substance']
 Hint: Hydrogen gas was once used to make large airships, such as blimps, float. It is no longer used in airships because it catches fire easily. The chemical formula for hydrogen is H2. 
Solution: You can tell whether hydrogen is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for hydrogen, H2, contains one atomic symbol: H. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element.
Since hydrogen is composed of only one chemical element, hydrogen is an elementary substance.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['3:1', '2:2', '1:3', '4:0', '0:4']
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have horns.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '4:0', '3:1', '0:4', '2:2']
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two horses. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.
A reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a reddish-brown coat must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
A black coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a reddish-brown coat to offspring with a black coat is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with a reddish-brown coat for every 2 offspring with a black coat.

This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sweet fruit or sour fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.
Sweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Sour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.

 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.
Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
Red fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['straight fur', 'curly fur']
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Precious is a cat from this group. Precious has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur type gene. 
Solution: Precious's genotype for the fur type gene is FF. Precious's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Precious's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Precious's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['commensal', 'parasitic', 'mutualistic']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.
A shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow.
Figure: a goby and an alpheid shrimp at the entrance of a burrow. 
Solution: When an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby, the goby alerts the shrimp about nearby predators. These alerts help the shrimp survive. So, the shrimp benefits from its relationship with the goby.
The goby also receives protection from predators when it shares the shrimp's burrow. So, the goby also benefits from its relationship with the shrimp.
Since both the shrimp and the goby benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby.

"1612"	"Question: Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the wing type trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['normal wings', 'vestigial wings']
 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Nn for the wing type gene. 
Solution: You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the wing type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This means N is a dominant allele, and n is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Nn has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait must be normal wings.

using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon
a piece of avocado turning brown
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '0:4', '3:1', '2:2', '4:0']
 Hint: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies:
Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.
Mutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with mutated antennae for every 1 offspring with normal antennae.

 Hint: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene. 
Solution: The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.
To check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.

Potassium chloride is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a compound', 'an elementary substance']
 Hint: Potassium chloride can be added to food as a substitute for table salt. The chemical formula for potassium chloride is KCl. 
Solution: You can tell whether potassium chloride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for potassium chloride, KCl, contains two atomic symbols: K for potassium and Cl for chlorine. So, the formula tells you that potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since potassium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium chloride is a compound.

 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene. 
Solution: Cheyenne's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a red coat. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['3:1', '0:4', '2:2', '4:0', '1:3']
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:
Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a hairy body', 'a hairless body']
 Hint: In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).
Skippy is a deer mouse from this group. Skippy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene. 
Solution: Skippy's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skippy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.
To check this answer, consider whether Skippy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Skippy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['straight whiskers', 'curved whiskers']
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight whiskers and others have curved whiskers. In this group, the gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H).
Kiki is a Syrian hamster from this group. Kiki has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the whisker type gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait. First, consider the alleles in Kiki's genotype for the whisker type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Kiki's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kiki's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be straight whiskers.

Rain forming in a cloud is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air condenses into tiny droplets of liquid water. These droplets make up a cloud. When there is enough water in the air, the droplets will fall as rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But rain forming in a cloud is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Rain begins to form when water vapor in the air becomes liquid water. This is caused by cooling. But water evaporating from a puddle is not.

"1819"	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a hawk moth visits a petunia flower?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['commensal', 'mutualistic', 'parasitic']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis.
Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce.
Figure: a hawk moth visiting a petunia flower. 
Solution: When a hawk moth visits a petunia flower, the moth drinks nectar. The moth uses the nectar to survive and grow. So, the moth benefits from its relationship with the petunia.
The petunia flower is pollinated when the moth visits it. After the petunia is pollinated, it is able to reproduce. So, the petunia also benefits from its relationship with the moth.
Since both the moth and the petunia benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a hawk moth pollinates a petunia flower.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['cause-effect', 'compare-contrast']
 Hint: Read the text.
In 1968, when the Democratic Party held its convention in Chicago to select a presidential candidate, the United States was at war in Vietnam. Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process. 
Solution: The text uses a cause-effect structure to show the causes and effects of the violent demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. In the text, certain words and phrases help to organize ideas in a cause-effect structure. Notice the phrases giving rise to, because of, contributing to, set off, and led to.

dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas
water freezing into ice
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from solid to liquid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But water freezing into ice is not.

"1943"	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['dull fruit', 'glossy fruit']
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have dull fruit and others have glossy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f).
A certain cucumber plant from this group has the homozygous genotype FF for the fruit sheen gene. 
Solution: The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for dull fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

Scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the phrase, but many claim that Job is saying that he narrowly escaped death.
The allusion by the skin of his teeth means just barely.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['wavy fur', 'straight fur']
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Minnie is a Syrian hamster from this group. Minnie has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur texture gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Minnie's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Minnie's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Minnie's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Minnie's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['2:2', '0:4', '1:3', '4:0', '3:1']
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red eyes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['bumpy fruit', 'smooth fruit']
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for bumpy fruit (F).
A certain cucumber plant from this group has the homozygous genotype FF for the fruit texture gene. 
Solution: The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for bumpy fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be bumpy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for bumpy fruit (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be bumpy fruit.

"2123"	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['bush growth', 'climbing growth']
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the growth pattern gene. 
Solution: The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is gg. The rose plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for bush growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['4:0', '3:1', '1:3', '0:4', '2:2']
 Hint: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:
Watermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.
In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.
A yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.
A white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a white ground spot.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a black coat', 'a reddish-brown coat']
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Ace is a horse from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['yellow peas', 'green peas']
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have yellow peas and others have green peas. In this group, the gene for the pea color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e).
A certain pea plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the pea color gene. 
Solution: You need to determine the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the pea color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait must be yellow peas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['curved whiskers', 'straight whiskers']
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight whiskers and others have curved whiskers. In this group, the gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H).
Stuart is a Syrian hamster from this group. Stuart has the homozygous genotype hh for the whisker type gene. 
Solution: Stuart's genotype for the whisker type gene is hh. Stuart's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for curved whiskers. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.
To check this answer, consider whether Stuart's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Stuart's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.

mixing sand and water
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['a spotted coat', 'a black coat']
 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a).
Zuri is a leopard from this group. Zuri has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Zuri's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Zuri's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zuri's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['divergent', 'convergent', 'transform']
 Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture.
In Iceland, parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are above sea level. The Thingvellir Rift Valley is one example. This rift valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift. 
Solution: To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Thingvellir Rift Valley, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['dumbo ears', 'normal ears']
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E).
Pepe is a rat from this group. Pepe has the homozygous genotype EE for the ear type gene. 
Solution: Pepe's genotype for the ear type gene is EE. Pepe's genotype of EE has only E allelles. The E allele is for normal ears. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears.
To check this answer, consider whether Pepe's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Pepe's genotype of EE has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Pepe's phenotype for the ear type trait must be normal ears.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['yellow pods', 'green pods']
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have green pods and others have yellow pods. In this group, the gene for the pod color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).
A certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype DD for the pod color gene. 
Solution: The pea plant's genotype for the pod color gene is DD. The pea plant's genotype of DD has only D allelles. The D allele is for green pods. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D). This means D is a dominant allele, and d is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of DD has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pod color trait must be green pods.

"2523"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['black fur', 'brown fur']
 Hint: In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
Ringo is a rabbit from this group. Ringo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene. 
Solution: Ringo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Ringo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for brown fur. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Ringo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Ringo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Ringo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be brown fur.

"2530"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['soft fur', 'rough fur']
 Hint: In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f).
Chance is a dachshund dog from this group. Chance has the heterozygous genotype Ff for the fur texture gene. 
Solution: You need to determine Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait. First, consider the alleles in Chance's genotype for the fur texture gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chance's genotype of Ff has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chance's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be rough fur.

She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: The first text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
Destiny adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
The second text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). The bridge is old, but it is not actually a million years old.
Destiny adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect.

Lithobates palustris is in the genus Lithobates. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. So, Lithobates palustris and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.
Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus have the same species name within their genus, bivittatus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Melanoplus bivittatus is in the genus Melanoplus, and Python bivittatus is in the genus Python.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['2:2', '0:4', '1:3', '3:1', '4:0']
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem. 
Solution: Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The earthworm does not have arrows pointing from it to other organisms. So, the earthworm is a decomposer.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']
 Hint: Unavailable 
Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['4:0', '3:1', '1:3', '2:2', '0:4']
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.
White spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
Solid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with solid coloring.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles. 
Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature.

"2892"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['mostly plain scales', 'mostly iridescent scales']
 Hint: This passage describes the iridescent scales trait in bettas:

In a group of bettas, some individuals have mostly iridescent scales and others have mostly plain scales. In this group, the gene for the iridescent scales trait has two alleles. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i).
Poseidon is a betta from this group. Poseidon has the homozygous genotype ii for the iridescent scales gene. 
Solution: Poseidon's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is ii. Poseidon's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for mostly plain scales. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.
To check this answer, consider whether Poseidon's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Poseidon's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alcon blue butterflies spend the first part of their lives as caterpillars that live with Myrmica ants. When a caterpillar lives with the ants, it mimics, or pretends to be, an ant. The caterpillar can mimic the ants by copying their smell. The caterpillar can also make noises that make it sound like a queen ant. Queen ants receive more food and better protection than any other ants in the nest.
So, when the caterpillar mimics an ant, the ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest.
Figure: a Myrmica ant caring for an Alcon blue caterpillar. 
Solution: When an Alcon blue caterpillar lives in a Myrmica ant nest, the caterpillar gets food and protection. So, the caterpillar benefits from its relationship with the ants.
The ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest. So, the ants are harmed by their relationship with the caterpillar.
Since the caterpillar benefits and the ants are harmed, a parasitic relationship is formed when an Alcon blue caterpillar lives in a Myrmica ant nest.

"2927"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['wavy fur', 'straight fur']
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f).
Biscotti is a Syrian hamster from this group. Biscotti has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene. 
Solution: Biscotti's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Biscotti's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Biscotti's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Biscotti's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.

Water freezing into ice is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The water changes from solid to liquid. But the ice is still made of the same type of matter as the liquid water.
Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '2:2', '3:1', '0:4', '4:0']
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a golden body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two guppies. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.
A golden body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a golden body must have the genotype bb.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with a gray body for every 1 offspring with a golden body.

"3105"	"Question: Based on this information, what is Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['dark fur', 'light fur']
 Hint: In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f).
Boba is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Boba has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene. 
Solution: Boba's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Boba's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Boba's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Boba's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.

"3108"	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '4:0', '3:1', '2:2', '0:4']
 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:
Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies. 
Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.
Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['KRT13 gene . . . keratin protein', 'keratin protein . . . KRT13 gene']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Keratins are strong proteins that provide structure and protection for many tissues in the human body. For example, the tissue on the inside of the mouth, called epithelium (ep-i-THEEL-i-um), is protected by a tough layer made of many types of keratin proteins connected together. One type of keratin protein is encoded by the KRT13 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the KRT13 gene. Compared to the KRT13 gene without a mutation, the mutated KRT13 gene encoded a form of the keratin protein with a different structure.
This different form of the keratin protein could not connect to other keratin proteins.The person with the mutation had mouth epithelium that was easily damaged by simple activities like eating and brushing teeth.
Figure: strands of connected keratin proteins, seen through a high-powered microscope. 
Solution: A mutation in a gene may affect the protein it encodes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi.', 'The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kimi.']
 Hint: Kimi is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kimi with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kimi with a force of 1,200N. 
Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Kimi, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Kimi down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Kimi up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kimi.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.']
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes. 
Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2.
