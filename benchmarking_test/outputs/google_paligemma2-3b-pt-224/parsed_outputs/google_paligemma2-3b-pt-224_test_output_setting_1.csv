 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['0:4', '4:0', '2:2', '1:3', '3:1']
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:
The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.
In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

A rat tapeworm is a type of flatworm that can live inside a rat's body. When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive.
The tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall. Inside the rat's intestine, the tapeworm absorbs nutrients from food that the rat has eaten. If the rat has many tapeworms in its intestines, it will become weak from lack of nutrients.

 Task: closed choice

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

White sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection.
The worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive.

Luther dipped a sponge in water and used it to scrub the crayon on a small section of the wall. He dipped a second sponge in water, sprinkled it with baking soda, and used it to scrub the crayon on another section of the wall. He observed how much crayon was removed from each section. Luther repeated this test two more times on other sections of the wall.

"573"	"Question: Read the following excerpt from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her academic voice?
Many people don't recycle because throwing things away is easier, even though doing so can be damaging to the environment. People are lazy and selfish, always wanting what is good for themselves, not necessarily what is good for society. As a result, many people do not take the steps that are required to recycle different materials. For example, some towns require residents to sort items before leaving them at the curbside; this causes some to skip recycling altogether, even though doing so is unethical.

"991"	"Question: Complete the sentence.
The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['chloride channel protein . . . CLCN1 gene', 'CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Muscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.
One of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.
This different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.
Figure: muscles in the human body.

"1285"	"Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses.', 'The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers.', ""The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice."", 'The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.']
 Hint: Read the text about cats.
Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.
People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.
It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.
Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['commensal', 'parasitic', 'mutualistic']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.
A shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow.

 Hint: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies:
Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a).

 Task: closed choice

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis.
Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce.

 Hint: Read the text.
In 1968, when the Democratic Party held its convention in Chicago to select a presidential candidate, the United States was at war in Vietnam. Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process.

The Thingvellir Rift Valley formed at a () boundary.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['divergent', 'convergent', 'transform']
 Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture.
In Iceland, parts of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge are above sea level. The Thingvellir Rift Valley is one example. This rift valley began to form as the North American Plate and the Eurasian Plate moved away from each other. In this picture, you can see the gap that formed during a major plate movement along the rift. Gaps such as this form when the two plates move apart, creating a large crack in the crust. The last time this happened in the Thingvellir Rift Valley was in the spring of 1789. Since then, a walking path was built along the rift valley to allow park visitors to walk along the rift.

 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alcon blue butterflies spend the first part of their lives as caterpillars that live with Myrmica ants. When a caterpillar lives with the ants, it mimics, or pretends to be, an ant. The caterpillar can mimic the ants by copying their smell. The caterpillar can also make noises that make it sound like a queen ant. Queen ants receive more food and better protection than any other ants in the nest.
So, when the caterpillar mimics an ant, the ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '4:0', '3:1', '2:2', '0:4']
 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:
Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.

 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Keratins are strong proteins that provide structure and protection for many tissues in the human body. For example, the tissue on the inside of the mouth, called epithelium (ep-i-THEEL-i-um), is protected by a tough layer made of many types of keratin proteins connected together. One type of keratin protein is encoded by the KRT13 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the KRT13 gene. Compared to the KRT13 gene without a mutation, the mutated KRT13 gene encoded a form of the keratin protein with a different structure.
This different form of the keratin protein could not connect to other keratin proteins.The person with the mutation had mouth epithelium that was easily damaged by simple activities like eating and brushing teeth.
Figure: strands of connected keratin proteins, seen through a high-powered microscope.
