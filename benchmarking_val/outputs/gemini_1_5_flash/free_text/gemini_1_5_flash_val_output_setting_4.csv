0	0	"Question: What does the verbal irony in this text suggest?
According to Mr. Herrera's kids, his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The snoring is loud. (1) The snoring occurs in bursts.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Herrera's snoring."	"The correct answer is **(0) The snoring is loud.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** is when someone says something that is the opposite of what they mean, often to create humor or emphasize a point. 
*  The statement ""his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer"" is clearly ironic. Jackhammers are known for being incredibly loud, so comparing the snoring to one implies that it's **extremely loud**.

1	1	"Question: Which animal's mouth is also adapted for bottom feeding?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) discus (1) armored catfish
 Hint: Sturgeons eat invertebrates, plants, and small fish. They are bottom feeders. Bottom feeders find their food at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.
The 's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding.
Figure: sturgeon.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the sturgeon.
The sturgeon's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding. The sturgeon uses its mouth to find food hidden in the sediment at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The armored catfish's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding.
The discus's mouth is not located on the underside of its head. Its mouth is not adapted for bottom feeding."	"The answer is **(1) armored catfish**. 

Here's why:

* **Sturgeons** are bottom feeders, meaning they eat food found on the bottom of water bodies. Their mouths are positioned on the underside of their heads, pointing downwards, which is perfectly adapted for this feeding style.
* **Armored catfish** also have mouths located on the underside of their heads, pointing downwards. This indicates they too are adapted for bottom feeding.
* **Discus** do not have mouths adapted for bottom feeding. Their mouths are not positioned on the underside of their heads. 

Therefore, the armored catfish is the animal whose mouth is also adapted for bottom feeding, similar to the sturgeon.

5	5	"Question: Based on this information, what is Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.
 Solution: Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Daffodil's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Daffodil's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"The correct answer is **(0) not having horns**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Daffodil has the genotype HH, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele (H) for not having horns.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means that if an individual has at least one H allele, they will not have horns. 
* **Phenotype:** Since Daffodil has two H alleles, her phenotype (observable trait) is **not having horns**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sable (1) New Zealand falcon
 Hint: Bald eagles eat fish, mammals, and other birds. The 's feet are adapted for grabbing prey.
Figure: bald eagle.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey. The sharp claws can help the bald eagle attack and kill its prey. The long toes can help it hold on to its prey.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The New Zealand falcon has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey.
The sable has hoofed feet. Its feet are not adapted for grabbing prey. The sable uses its feet to walk and run on hard ground."	"The answer is **(1) New Zealand falcon**. 

Here's why:

* **Bald Eagles and New Zealand Falcons:** Both have strong talons (claws) on their feet that are specifically designed for grabbing and holding prey. This adaptation is crucial for birds of prey to hunt effectively.
* **Sables:**  Sables are mammals with hooves, which are adapted for running on land, not grabbing prey.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Complete the sentence with the word kissing. It describes the raindrops as if they were people showing affection."	"The answer is **(1) kissing**. 

Here's why:

* **Personification** is giving human qualities to non-human things. In this case, the raindrops are being described as if they have the ability to ""kiss"" the fans' cheeks. 
* **""Landing on""** is a more literal and less imaginative way to describe the raindrops.

Michael dropped out of college to travel the world, but a year later, the prodigal son returned home and re-enrolled.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the Bible (1) British history
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion prodigal son is the Bible.
In a Biblical parable, the prodigal son irresponsibly spends the inheritance given to him by his father. When he returns home, he expects to be shamed, but his father forgives him.
The allusion prodigal son means a person who behaves recklessly but later makes a repentant return."	"The answer is **(0) the Bible**. 

You are absolutely right! The phrase ""prodigal son"" comes from the parable of the prodigal son in the Bible (Luke 15:11-32).  The story tells of a young man who squanders his inheritance and returns home, humbled and repentant, only to be welcomed with open arms by his father. 

This allusion is commonly used to describe someone who has gone astray but eventually returns to a more responsible or righteous path.

 Hint: In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele F is for short fur, and the allele f is for long fur.
Sasha, a dog from this group, has short fur. Sasha has one allele for short fur and one allele for long fur.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Sasha's observable version of the fur length trait is short fur. So, Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is short fur."	"The correct answer is **(1) short fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genes (genotype). 
* Sasha's phenotype for fur length is **short fur** because that's what we can physically observe about her. 
* Even though she has one allele for short fur (F) and one for long fur (f), the dominant allele (F) for short fur is expressed, resulting in her having short fur.

 Solution: The first sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two simple sentences joined by a comma and the conjunction so.
Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath."	"You are absolutely correct! Here's why:

* **Compound sentences** are made up of two or more independent clauses (complete sentences that can stand alone). These clauses are joined by a coordinating conjunction (like *and*, *but*, *or*, *so*, *for*, *yet*, or *nor*) and often a comma.

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes.** This is a **simple sentence**. It has one independent clause.
* **(1) Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath.** This is a **compound sentence**. It has two independent clauses:
    * ""Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 4:0 (3) 3:1 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black eyes. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red eyes."	"The answer is **(2) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive trait:** Black eyes are determined by the recessive allele ""e"". To have black eyes, a fish needs two copies of the ""e"" allele (ee).
* **Punnett Square:**  The Punnett square shows that all offspring will have the genotype ""ee"". 
* **Dominant trait:** Red eyes are determined by the dominant allele ""E"". Even having one ""E"" allele will result in red eyes.
* **No red eyes:** Since the Punnett square only shows ""ee"" genotypes, there will be no offspring with red eyes.

Therefore, the expected ratio is 4 black eyes : 0 red eyes.

 Hint: A shopper is buying food at the store. He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape.
 Solution: Look for the shopping bag that is heavier.
A shopping bag holding 5 pounds of food is heavier than a shopping bag holding 4 pounds of food. So, the bag holding 5 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other bag."	"The answer is **(1) a bag holding 5 pounds of food**. 

Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  Force is needed to overcome an object's weight.  The heavier the object, the more force is required.
* **Weight and Mass:**  Weight is directly related to an object's mass. More mass means more weight.
* **The Bags:** The bag with 5 pounds of food has more mass than the bag with 4 pounds, making it heavier.  Therefore, more force is needed to lift it at the same speed.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a chemical change. The salt and vinegar change the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. This makes the penny look shiny again."	"The answer is **(1) chemical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Chemical Change:** Involves the formation of new substances with different properties. The tarnish on a penny is a chemical compound (usually copper oxide). The vinegar and salt react with the copper oxide, changing it into a different compound that is soluble and can be wiped away. 
* **Physical Change:** Alters the form or appearance of a substance but doesn't change its chemical composition. Examples include melting ice or cutting paper.

Since the tarnish is transformed into a different substance, it's a chemical change.

cooking a pancake
rust forming on a bicycle frame
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
Rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bicycle frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But rust forming on a bicycle frame is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Cooking a pancake:** This involves a chemical reaction where the heat causes the ingredients in the batter to change their composition. The batter transforms into a solid pancake with a different texture and taste.
* **Rust forming on a bicycle frame:** This is a chemical reaction between iron (in the frame) and oxygen (in the air). This reaction creates iron oxide, which we know as rust. The iron has chemically changed into a different substance.

41	41	"Question: Which organizational structure does this text primarily use?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) compare-contrast (1) problem-solution
 Hint: Read the text.
In the 1970s, architect I. M. Pei took on the difficult assignment of renovating and updating the beautiful Louvre Palace in Paris without overpowering the original building. The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances. It also needed more restrooms and a bigger cafeteria. Pei designed a large central underground entrance and visitor center. He then added a glass pyramid above the entryway. Although Pei's design faced initial criticism, today the pyramid is considered a brilliant success—a landmark that complements the old palace without interfering with it.
 Solution: The text uses a problem-solution structure to show how architect I.M. Pei modernized the Louvre with an entrance that complemented the existing building. In the text, certain words and phrases help to organize ideas in a problem-solution structure. Notice the phrases difficult assignment and brilliant success."	"The correct answer is **(1) problem-solution**. 

The text clearly identifies a problem (the Louvre's confusing layout, lack of amenities) and then presents I.M. Pei's solution (the glass pyramid and underground entrance). The solution is then evaluated as a success, further reinforcing the problem-solution structure.

Don't ever get a ride from Mariana. Her brother has been driving for only six months, and he's already gotten three speeding tickets.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Mariana must be a reckless driver, because her brother is a reckless driver. However, even though Mariana's brother is reckless, that doesn't necessarily mean that Mariana is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* The argument attempts to discredit Mariana's driving abilities based solely on her brother's driving record. This is an example of guilt by association because it unfairly connects Mariana to her brother's negative actions.

49	49	"Question: Based on this information, what is Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) short fur (1) long fur
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Chanel is a cat from this group. Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene.
 Solution: Chanel's genotype for the fur length gene is FF. Chanel's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for short fur. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chanel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chanel's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur."	"The answer is **(0) short fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Chanel has the genotype FF, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele for short fur (F).
* **Dominant Allele:**  The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
* **Phenotype:**  Since Chanel has at least one dominant allele (F), her phenotype will express the dominant trait, which is short fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 28°C (1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22°C (2) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 41°C
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 22°C bowl of oatmeal is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22°C**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of an object due to the random motion of its atoms and molecules.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. 

The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving and the more thermal energy they possess. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal at the lowest temperature (22°C) will have the least thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.

* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula: KE = (1/2) * mv^2, where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity of the particle

* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * The problem states that the particles in both samples have the same mass (30 u).
    * Sample A has a higher average particle speed (1,200 m/s) than sample B (1,000 m/s). 

Since sample A has particles with a higher average speed, they will have a higher average kinetic energy. This means sample A has the higher temperature.

The Gobi Desert is a cold desert ecosystem located in northern China and southern Mongolia. This desert is next to the Himalayan Mountains and used to be part of the Mongol Empire.
 Solution: A cold desert is a type of ecosystem. Cold deserts have the following features: a small amount of rain or snow, dry, thin soil, and long, cold winters. So, the following statements describe the Gobi Desert ecosystem: a small amount of rain or snow, dry, thin soil, and long, cold winters. It has a small amount of rain or snow. It has long, cold winters. The following statement does not describe the Gobi Desert: a small amount of rain or snow, dry, thin soil, and long, cold winters. It has warm summers and mild winters."	"The correct answer is **(1) It has a small amount of rain or snow.** 

Here's why:

* **Cold Deserts:** The Gobi Desert is a cold desert. Cold deserts are characterized by having very little rainfall. 
* **Warm Summers & Mild Winters:** The statement about warm summers and mild winters is incorrect. Cold deserts, like the Gobi, experience long, cold winters. 

The image provided in the hint shows a snowy landscape, further reinforcing the idea that the Gobi Desert receives very little precipitation.

65	65	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 3:1 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two summer squash plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with fuzzy leaves or smooth leaves, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for fuzzy leaves, is dominant over the l allele, which is for smooth leaves.
Fuzzy leaves is the dominant allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the dominant version of the leaf texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy leaves must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
Smooth leaves is the recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the recessive version of the leaf texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with smooth leaves must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with fuzzy leaves for every 2 offspring with smooth leaves."	"The answer is **(4) 2:2**. 

The Punnett square shows that there are two boxes with the genotype LL or Ll (fuzzy leaves) and two boxes with the genotype ll (smooth leaves).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1. (1) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. (2) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. 
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a distance of 2 inches between the magnets, while Pair 2 has a distance of 3 inches.  Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer, the magnetic force between them will be stronger.

 Solution: The first text uses disinterested in its traditional sense: unbiased or impartial.
The restaurant reviews on this website are not exactly disinterested—restaurants can pay to remove unflattering reviews—but Patrick still finds it useful for finding new places to eat.
The second text uses disinterested in its nontraditional sense: uninterested or indifferent.
Patrick is disinterested in reading page after page of restaurant reviews on the Internet; he prefers to try out new restaurants for himself and make up his own mind.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word disinterested because it is considered more standard."	"The answer is **(0) Patrick is disinterested in reading page after page of restaurant reviews on the Internet; he prefers to try out new restaurants for himself and make up his own mind.**

Here's why:

* **Disinterested (Traditional Sense):**  Means impartial, unbiased, or having no personal stake in the outcome. 
* **Disinterested (Nontraditional Sense):**  Means uninterested, indifferent, or lacking enthusiasm.

In choice (0), Patrick is described as being ""disinterested"" in reading reviews because he wants to form his own opinions. This aligns with the traditional sense of the word, implying he doesn't want to be influenced by others' opinions.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Professor Chang's research is untrustworthy because someone else at her university was caught falsifying data. However, this isn't necessarily true. The practices of one researcher at a university do not necessarily reflect the practices of another researcher at the same university. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is the fallacy of assuming someone is guilty or wrong because they are associated with someone else who is guilty or wrong.  In this case, the speaker assumes Professor Chang is untrustworthy because another researcher at the same university was caught falsifying data. 

The other options are incorrect:

* **Straw man:** This involves misrepresenting someone's argument to make it easier to attack. This isn't happening here.

 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The reaction changes the stains into different types of matter that wash away easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **A piece of apple turning brown:** This is a chemical reaction called oxidation. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air, changing its chemical composition and creating a new substance (the brown color).
* **Bleaching clothes:** Bleach contains chemicals that react with the pigments in the fabric, breaking them down and changing their color. This is also a chemical change. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the appearance or form of a substance but don't change its chemical composition.  
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:** Neither change is directly caused by cooling. 
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  Neither change is directly caused by heating.

 Choices: (0) golden frog (1) bison
 Hint: Amphibians have moist skin and begin their lives in water. A red-eyed tree frog is an example of an amphibian.
 Solution: A golden frog is an amphibian. It has moist skin and begins its life in water.
A bison is a mammal. It has fur and feeds its young milk."	"The answer is **(0) golden frog**. 

Here's why:

* **Amphibians** are a class of animals that live part of their lives in water and part on land.  They have smooth, moist skin that helps them absorb water. Frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts are all amphibians.
* **Golden frogs** are a type of frog, and therefore, an amphibian. 
* **Bison** are mammals, not amphibians. They have fur, give birth to live young, and nurse their babies.

98	98	"Question: Assume all other forces on Kylie are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Kylie?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kylie. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie.
 Hint: Kylie is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kylie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kylie with a force of 1,200N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Kylie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Kylie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Kylie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced Forces:**  When forces on an object are not equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they are considered unbalanced. In this case, the upward force from the seat (1,200 N) is greater than the downward force of gravity (600 N).
* **Net Force:** An unbalanced force results in a net force. The net force is the difference between the forces acting on an object. In this case, the net force is 1,200 N - 600 N = 600 N upward.

Since there's a net force, Kylie will experience an acceleration.  This means she'll feel pushed up against the seat as the roller coaster continues its journey.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. (1) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:**  Pair 1 has a distance of 5 inches between the magnets, while Pair 2 has a distance of 2 inches.  Since Pair 1 has a larger distance, the magnetic force will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(0) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of a magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Equal Distance:**  In both Pair 1 and Pair 2, the magnets are separated by the same distance (3 cm).
* **Same Material:** Since the magnets are made of the same material, their magnetic properties are identical.

Therefore, since the distance and the magnetic properties are the same, the magnetic force will be the same strength in both pairs.

 Choices: (0) Graphite is formed in nature. It is a pure substance. (1) A brick is made by humans. It is not a pure substance. (2) Quartz is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
A brick is made by humans. But minerals are not made by living things.
A brick is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a brick is not a mineral.
Quartz is a mineral.
Graphite is a mineral."	"The correct answer is **(1) A brick is made by humans. It is not a pure substance.**

Here's why:

* **Minerals are naturally occurring:** They are formed through geological processes, not by human intervention.
* **Minerals are pure substances:** They have a consistent chemical composition. Bricks, on the other hand, are a mixture of clay, sand, and other materials.

Let's analyze the other choices:

* **(0) Graphite is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.** Graphite is a naturally occurring form of carbon and fits the definition of a mineral.
* **(2) Quartz is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.** Quartz is a common mineral, composed of silicon dioxide (SiO2).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But cooking an egg is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Melting glass:**  Heating the glass provides the energy needed to break the bonds holding the solid structure together, allowing it to become liquid.
* **Cooking an egg:**  Heat causes chemical reactions within the egg, changing the proteins and making them solidify. 

While both involve changes in state or structure, only heating is the common factor in both processes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, which led to the institution of the Miranda warning, was quite unique in that it had significant implications for law enforcement. Only a handful of Supreme Court decisions have had such an impact on daily police procedure. (1) The Miranda warning, the reading of rights given to a suspect by police prior to questioning, is not unique to the United States; a number of other countries have equivalent rights, including Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, and Kazakhstan.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
The Miranda warning, the reading of rights given to a suspect by police prior to questioning, is not unique to the United States; a number of other countries have equivalent rights, including Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, and Kazakhstan.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Miranda v. Arizona was one of a few Supreme Court cases to have implications for law enforcement, so it was not one of a kind in that respect. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.
The Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, which led to the institution of the Miranda warning, was quite unique in that it had significant implications for law enforcement. Only a handful of Supreme Court decisions have had such an impact on daily police procedure.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"You are absolutely correct! 

The second text uses ""unique"" in its traditional sense, meaning ""the only one of its kind"".  The sentence correctly points out that the Miranda warning is not unique to the US because other countries have similar rights.

The first text uses ""unique"" in a more figurative sense, meaning ""unusual"" or ""distinctive"". While the Miranda case was significant, it's not the *only* Supreme Court case to have a major impact on law enforcement.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ceramic mug (1) cotton apron
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the ceramic mug is harder. If you press on a piece of ceramic, it will not change shape."	"This is a great example of how to break down a question and use reasoning to arrive at the answer. Here's how the solution works:

1. **Define the Key Concept:** The question asks about ""hardness,"" so the solution first defines what hardness means: a material's resistance to changing shape under pressure.

2. **Apply the Concept to the Choices:** The solution then instructs the reader to imagine pressing on each object. 

3. **Reasoning:**  By imagining this, the reader can easily deduce that a ceramic mug is harder because it will resist deformation under pressure, unlike cotton, which will easily bend and change shape.

**This solution is effective because:**

* **It simplifies the concept:**  Instead of focusing on abstract definitions of hardness, it uses a relatable action (pressing) to help understand the concept.
* **It guides the reader:** The solution clearly explains how to compare the objects by using the concept of hardness.
* **It reinforces learning:** By actively imagining the interaction, the reader develops a deeper understanding of hardness.

This approach could be used to explain other abstract concepts in a clear and engaging way, making learning more accessible.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) African elephants have thin hair covering their body. Female elephants feed their offspring milk. Elephants live in groups called herds. The oldest female in the herd is usually the leader. (1) Gray tree frogs hatch from eggs without shells. They live underwater when they are tadpoles. They move onto land when they become adults. The moist skin of adult gray tree frogs can be green or gray. The color of their skin helps them hide on rocks or plants.
 Hint: Amphibians are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify amphibians:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
They have moist skin.
They make eggs with no shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.
 Solution: To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Amphibians have the following traits:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
They have moist skin.
They make eggs with no shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.
An African elephant has the following traits:
It feeds its offspring milk.
It has hair.
An African elephant does not have all of the traits of an amphibian. An African elephant is a mammal.
A gray tree frog has the following traits:
It spends part of its life in water and part on land.
It has moist skin.
It makes eggs with no shells.
A gray tree frog has the traits of an amphibian. A gray tree frog is an amphibian."	"The correct answer is **(1) Gray tree frogs**. 

Here's why:

* **Amphibian traits:** Amphibians have moist skin, lay eggs without shells, and spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
* **Gray Tree Frog Traits:**  The description of the gray tree frog perfectly matches these amphibian traits. They hatch from shell-less eggs, live as tadpoles in water, and become land-dwelling adults with moist skin.

**African elephants**, while fascinating animals, are mammals. They have fur (not thin hair), give birth to live young, and nurse their offspring with milk.

 Hint: This organism is a black-headed gull. Its scientific name is Chroicocephalus ridibundus.
 Solution: A black-headed gull's scientific name is Chroicocephalus ridibundus.
Chroicocephalus ridibundus is in the same genus as Chroicocephalus serranus, but they are not in the same species.
Organisms in the same species have the same scientific names. Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Chroicocephalus serranus are different species within the same genus.
Chroicocephalus ridibundus has the same scientific name as a black-headed gull. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Crocodylus moreletii does not have the same scientific name as a black-headed gull. So, Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Crocodylus moreletii are not in the same species."	"The answer is **(0) Chroicocephalus ridibundus**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific names:** The scientific name for an organism uniquely identifies its species. 
* **Black-headed gull:** The black-headed gull has the scientific name *Chroicocephalus ridibundus*.
* **Same species:**  To be in the same species, organisms must have the same scientific name.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the basketball with more thermal energy (1) the basketball with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two basketballs are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two basketballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the basketball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."	"The correct answer is **(0) the basketball with more thermal energy**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total energy of the particles within an object. It's related to the object's temperature, but it also depends on the object's mass.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within an object.  

Since the basketballs are identical in material and mass, the one with more thermal energy has a higher average kinetic energy of its particles, and therefore a higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) China grows most of the wheat in the world. (1) Mr. Everett cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Everett washes the car.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two simple sentences joined by a comma and the conjunction and.
Mr. Everett cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Everett washes the car."	"You're absolutely right! 

Here's why the second sentence is the compound sentence:

* **Compound Sentence Definition:**  A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined together by a coordinating conjunction (like *and*, *but*, *or*, *nor*, *for*, *so*, *yet*). 

* **Independent Clause:** An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a complete sentence. 

Let's break down the sentences:

**(0) China grows most of the wheat in the world.**  This is a simple sentence with one independent clause. 

**(1) Mr. Everett cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Everett washes the car.**  This sentence contains two independent clauses: 
    * **Mr. Everett cleans the chimney.** 
    * **Mrs. Everett washes the car.** 
    These clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction ""and.""

**Therefore, the compound sentence is (1).**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample B**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It depends on both the mass and the speed of an object.  
* **Higher Average Kinetic Energy:** Sample B has particles with both higher mass and higher average speed than Sample A. This means the particles in Sample B have a higher average kinetic energy. 
* **Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since Sample B has a higher average kinetic energy, it must have a higher temperature.

However, even though the speaker made the team after the rainbow appeared, that doesn't necessarily mean that the rainbow was responsible. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation."	"The correct answer is **(1) false causation**. 

Here's why:

* The speaker is incorrectly assuming that the rainbow directly caused them to make the basketball team.  There's no logical connection between the two events.  
* **False causation** occurs when someone assumes a correlation between two events means one caused the other.  Just because they happened close together doesn't mean they are related.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Jayla is from Springdale now she lives in Dover is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined without end punctuation: Jayla is from Springdale and Now she lives in Dover."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**The run-on sentence is: (1) Jayla is from Springdale now she lives in Dover.**

Here's why:

* **Run-on sentences** occur when two or more complete sentences are joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions.
* In this case, ""Jayla is from Springdale"" and ""Now she lives in Dover"" are both complete sentences. 
* They are incorrectly joined together with only the word ""now,"" which is not enough to connect them grammatically.

To fix it, you could:

* **Add a period:** Jayla is from Springdale. Now she lives in Dover.

 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a kitchen sink is 26 liters.
26 milliliters is too little."	"You are absolutely right! The answer is **(1) 26 liters**. 

Here's why:

* **Milliliters (ml)** are very small units of volume. They are typically used for measuring liquids in teaspoons or tablespoons.
* **Liters (L)** are a much larger unit of volume, often used for measuring liquids in bottles, pitchers, or even buckets. 

A kitchen sink is a large container, so it would hold much more than 26 milliliters. 26 liters is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a typical kitchen sink.

 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a).
Kumal is a jaguar from this group. Kumal has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Solution: Kumal's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Kumal's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Kumal's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Kumal's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."	"The correct answer is **(0) a spotted coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Kumal's genotype is **aa**, meaning he has two copies of the recessive allele (a) for a spotted coat.
* **Dominance:** The black coat allele (A) is dominant over the spotted coat allele (a). 
* **Recessive Expression:** Since Kumal only has the recessive alleles (aa), he will express the recessive trait, which is a spotted coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I).
Mer is a guppy from this group. Mer has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Mer's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Mer's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Mer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Mer's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."	"The answer is **(1) an unspotted tail**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive. This means it only expresses itself if an individual has two copies of the recessive allele (ii).
* **Mer's Genotype:** Mer has the genotype ii, meaning they have two copies of the recessive allele.
* **Phenotype:**  Since Mer has two copies of the recessive allele, their phenotype (physical trait) will be an unspotted tail.

Cracking open a peanut is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chemical change (1) physical change
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Cracking open a peanut is a physical change. The peanut shell breaks and the peanut falls out. Both are still made of the same type of matter."	"The answer is **(1) physical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition. Cracking a peanut changes its shape (breaks the shell) but doesn't alter the peanut's chemical makeup. 
* **Chemical Change:** A change that results in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties.

 Hint: This organism is an axolotl. Its scientific name is Ambystoma mexicanum.
 Solution: An axolotl's scientific name is Ambystoma mexicanum.
Ambystoma mexicanum has the same scientific name as an axolotl. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Camellia sasanqua does not have the same scientific name as an axolotl. So, Ambystoma mexicanum and Camellia sasanqua are not in the same species.
Tigrisoma mexicanum does have the same species within its genus as an axolotl, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species."	"The answer is **(0) Ambystoma mexicanum**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:**  Scientific names are like unique identifiers for organisms. They follow a two-part system (genus and species). An axolotl's scientific name is *Ambystoma mexicanum*.
* **Same Species:** To be in the same species, organisms must have the same scientific name.  *Ambystoma mexicanum* is the only choice with the same scientific name as the axolotl.

Let's look at the other options:

* **(1) Camellia sasanqua:**  This is a species of plant, not related to the axolotl.
* **(2) Tigrisoma mexicanum:** While it has the same species name (mexicanum), it belongs to a different genus (*Tigrisoma*), meaning it's not the same species as the axolotl.

rust forming on a bicycle frame
grilling a hamburger
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bicycle frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Grilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking a hamburger is caused by heating. But rust forming on a bicycle frame is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Rust forming on a bicycle frame:** This is a chemical change because the iron in the bicycle frame reacts with oxygen in the air, forming a new substance called iron oxide (rust). The composition of the material changes.
* **Grilling a hamburger:** This is also a chemical change because the heat from the grill causes the proteins and fats in the meat to break down and rearrange, creating new molecules and changing the texture and flavor of the meat. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling is not involved in either process.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes only alter the form or appearance of a substance, not its chemical composition. Rusting and grilling involve changes in chemical composition. 
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** While grilling is caused by heating, rusting is a result of a chemical reaction with oxygen, not directly due to heat.

 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard is a physical change. Both the iron and the magnet are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A physical change alters the form or appearance of a substance but doesn't change its chemical composition. 
    * **Magnet and Iron:** The magnet separates iron from other materials, but the iron itself remains chemically unchanged.
    * **Sewing:** The fabric and thread are cut and sewn into a new shape, but the materials themselves are still fabric and thread.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
Elise made all of her daughter's baby clothes by hand, including a unique hand-knitted romper that she designed herself.
The second text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Elise may have been looking for an unusual name, but if she found it on a baby name website, it is not actually one of a kind.
Elise wanted her daughter to have a unique name, so she browsed baby name websites for months to find the perfect one.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"The correct answer is **(0) Elise made all of her daughter's baby clothes by hand, including a unique hand-knitted romper that she designed herself.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional ""unique""** means being the only one of its kind. The romper in this sentence is described as ""unique"" because it was hand-knitted and designed by Elise, making it truly one-of-a-kind.

* **Nontraditional ""unique""** is often used to mean ""interesting"" or ""unusual"".  The second sentence uses ""unique"" in this way, implying that Elise was searching for a name that was different and stood out, not necessarily a name that was entirely original.

Therefore, the first sentence uses ""unique"" in its more traditional sense, while the second sentence uses it in a more common, but less precise, way.

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size:** The magnets in both Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same size.
* **Distance:** The distance between the magnets in both pairs is also the same (4.5 inches).
* **Pole Orientation:** The poles of the magnets in both pairs are aligned in a way that creates an attractive force (North pole facing South pole).

Since the size, distance, and pole orientation are identical in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same.

 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
Downsizing is an indirect way of saying that the company is planning on firing employees, closing shops or branches, and/or reducing its budget."	"The correct answer is **(0) euphemism**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:** A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. ""Downsizing"" is a euphemism for layoffs or job cuts.

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **Apostrophe:** An apostrophe is a figure of speech that directly addresses an absent person or a personified thing. This is not present in the text.

 Choices: (0) a bird that moved 25kilometers in 5hours (1) a bird that moved 15kilometers in 5hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each bird moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bird moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other bird moved 15 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each bird spent the same amount of time moving. The bird that moved 25 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bird must have moved at a higher speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) a bird that moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours**.

Here's why:

* **Speed** is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took. 
* Both birds traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours).
* The bird that traveled 25 kilometers covered a greater distance in that time, meaning it had a higher speed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Force Direction:** The magnetic force can be attractive (pulling magnets together) or repulsive (pushing magnets apart). This depends on the orientation of the poles (north and south).  Pair 1 shows repulsion, while Pair 2 shows attraction.
* **Force Magnitude:**  The strength of the magnetic force depends on:
    * **Magnet Strength:** The magnets in both pairs are made of the same material, so their strength is assumed to be the same.
    * **Distance:** The distance between the magnets in both pairs is 1.05 cm, so the distance is the same.
    * **Size:** The size of the magnets in both pairs is identical (though the shape is different).

Since the factors influencing the magnitude of the magnetic force are identical in both pairs, the magnitude of the force is the same.

 Solution: The best estimate for the volume of a blender is 60 fluid ounces.
60 cups and 60 gallons are both too much."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **60 gallons** is an enormous amount, more than a standard bathtub. Blenders are much smaller.
* **60 cups** is also quite large. While some blenders have a larger capacity, 60 cups is more typical of a large pitcher or container.
* **60 fluid ounces** is a reasonable size for a standard household blender.

milk going sour
roasting a marshmallow over a campfire
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Roasting is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Milk going sour:** This is a chemical change because the milk's composition changes. Bacteria convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid, which gives the milk its sour taste and smell. This is a change in the chemical makeup of the milk.

* **Roasting a marshmallow:** This is also a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the sugar in the marshmallow to caramelize and brown. This is a change in the chemical composition of the marshmallow, resulting in a different taste and texture. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  This is incorrect because milk going sour is caused by bacteria, not cooling.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** This is partially correct, as roasting a marshmallow is caused by heating. However, milk going sour is not caused by heat; it's caused by bacteria.
* **(3) Both are only physical changes:**  This is incorrect because both processes involve changes in the chemical makeup of the substances involved.

Mr. Chen is enjoying his golden years in a luxurious beachside community just down the street from his grandchildren.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Mr. Chen lives near his family. (1) Mr. Chen is old.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The euphemism golden years indicates that Mr. Chen is old. Golden years is a nicer way of referring to old age."	"The correct answer is **(1) Mr. Chen is old.**

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:** The phrase ""golden years"" is a euphemism for old age.  Euphemisms are used to soften potentially harsh or negative language. 
* **Direct vs. Indirect:**  While the text technically states Mr. Chen is enjoying his ""golden years,"" it's an indirect way of saying he is elderly. 
* **Focus on Positive:** The text emphasizes the positive aspects of this stage of life (luxury, proximity to family), further implying the euphemistic nature of ""golden years.""

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 50°C pot of spaghetti sauce is colder than the 60°C pot of spaghetti sauce, it has less thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) a pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 50°C**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total energy of all the particles within an object.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those particles. 

Since both pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass and composition, the one with the lower temperature (50°C) has less average kinetic energy per particle and therefore less total thermal energy.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.** 

Here's why:

* **Size Matters:** The strength of a magnetic force depends on the size of the magnets. Larger magnets create stronger magnetic fields. 
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:** In Pair 1, the magnet on the right is larger than the corresponding magnet in Pair 2. 
* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** While the direction of the force depends on whether the magnets attract or repel, the size difference between the magnets in Pair 1 makes the magnetic force stronger overall.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an allusion, a brief reference to someone or something well known.
Benedict Arnold alludes to the American general during the Revolutionary War who betrayed his country and fought for the British."	"The correct answer is **(1) allusion**. 

Here's why:

* **Allusion:** A brief and indirect reference to a person, place, thing, or event from history, literature, mythology, or popular culture. In this case, ""Benedict Arnold"" is a historical figure known for his betrayal, and the speaker is comparing Peter's actions to Arnold's.

* **Simile:** A figure of speech that uses ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two unlike things.  There's no ""like"" or ""as"" in the sentence. 

The text doesn't directly compare Peter to Benedict Arnold; it uses the name as a shorthand to convey the idea of betrayal. This is the essence of an allusion.

Kayla, I've told you a million times: you need to dry the dishes before you put them away.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hyperbole (1) oxymoron
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses hyperbole, an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
A million times is an exaggeration, since it is unlikely that Kayla has actually been told this a million times."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(0) hyperbole**. 

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole** is a figure of speech that uses exaggeration for emphasis or humor.  The speaker is clearly not stating that they've told Kayla something a million times, but rather emphasizing how often they've repeated the instruction. 

* **Oxymoron** is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory terms (like ""jumbo shrimp"").  This is not present in the text.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.**  Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** In Pair 1, the magnets are 3 inches apart. In Pair 2, the magnets are 2 inches apart. 
* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker than in Pair 2.

Jaylen's leaving his job? That's old news. He's been planning that for months.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) oxymoron (1) anaphora
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Old news is a contradiction, because news is recent information."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(0) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:**  A figure of speech that combines two contradictory terms. In this case, ""old news"" is contradictory because news is typically considered new information.

Let's break down why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Anaphora:**  The repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses or sentences. This is not present in the text. 

The use of ""old news"" to describe something that has been known for a long time creates a humorous and ironic effect.

231	231	"Question: Which is harder?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) clay tile (1) paper bag
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the clay tile is harder. If you step on clay tile, it will not change shape."	"This is a great example of a question designed to test a child's understanding of the concept of ""hardness."" Here's a breakdown of why the solution works:

* **The question focuses on a property:** It doesn't ask which is ""heavier"" or ""bigger,"" but which is ""harder."" This means the answer relies on understanding what ""hardness"" means.
* **The solution uses a simple analogy:**  The solution uses the idea of pushing on a material to help the child understand that a hard material resists deformation. 
* **Visual cues are emphasized:** The solution encourages the child to look at the pictures and imagine the results of pushing on each material. 
* **The solution provides a clear answer:**  It states that the clay tile is harder because it won't change shape under pressure.

This approach effectively teaches the child about hardness in a way that is engaging and easy to understand.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chiasmus (1) hyperbole
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses chiasmus, an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words.
The second half of the sentence reverses the order of the words all and one relative to the first half."	"The answer is **(0) chiasmus**. 

Here's why:

* **Chiasmus** is a rhetorical device where two or more clauses are balanced against each other, with the second clause reversing the grammatical structure of the first. 
* In this case, the first half of the sentence is ""All for one"", and the second half is ""one for all"". The words ""all"" and ""one"" are reversed in the second half, creating the chiasmus effect.

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **Hyperbole** is an exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. This quote doesn't use exaggerated language.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution A (1) Solution B (2) neither; their concentrations are the same
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles."	"The answer is **(0) Solution A**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given volume of solvent.  
* **Solution A** has 13 yellow particles in 45 mL of solvent. 
* **Solution B** has 9 yellow particles in 45 mL of solvent. 

Since Solution A has more yellow particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

Lee took several incredible panoramic photographs of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) compound (1) complex (2) compound-complex (3) simple
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The sentence is simple. It is a single independent clause.
Lee took several incredible panoramic photographs of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain."	"The solution is correct. The sentence is indeed **(3) simple**. 

Here's why:

* **Simple sentences** contain one independent clause. An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone.
* This sentence has only one subject (Lee) and one verb (took). It expresses a single complete idea.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Compound sentences** have two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and"", ""but"", ""or"").
* **(1) Complex sentences** have one independent clause and one or more dependent clauses. Dependent clauses cannot stand alone and are often introduced by conjunctions like ""because"", ""although"", or ""while"".
* **(2) Compound-complex sentences** have two or more independent clauses and at least one dependent clause. 

Since the sentence in question only has one independent clause, it's classified as a simple sentence.

 Hint: This organism is a green tree frog. Its scientific name is Hyla cinerea.
 Solution: A green tree frog's scientific name is Hyla cinerea.
Bufo viridis does not have the same scientific name as a green tree frog. So, Hyla cinerea and Bufo viridis are not in the same species.
Hyla cinerea has the same scientific name as a green tree frog. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Atelopus zeteki does not have the same scientific name as a green tree frog. So, Hyla cinerea and Atelopus zeteki are not in the same species."	"The answer is **(0) Hyla cinerea**. 

Here's why:

* **Species classification:**  Organisms are classified into species based on their ability to reproduce with each other and produce fertile offspring.  
* **Scientific names:**  Scientific names are used to provide a consistent and globally recognized way to identify species. 
* **Matching names:** The green tree frog is scientifically known as *Hyla cinerea*.  The only option that matches this name is *Hyla cinerea*.

 Solution: A hammerhead shark is a fish. It lives underwater. It has fins, not limbs.
Hammerhead sharks get their names from the shape of their heads. They have a wide, flat head and a small mouth.
A green chameleon is a reptile. It has scaly, waterproof skin.
Chameleons eat insects. They use their long, sticky tongues to catch their prey.
A western toad is an amphibian. It has moist skin and begins its life in water.
Toads do not have teeth! They swallow their food whole.
A Banggai cardinalfish is a fish. It lives underwater. It has fins, not limbs.
Cardinalfish often live near coral reefs. They are nocturnal, which means that they are active mostly at night."	"The answer is **(2) western toad**. 

Here's why:

* **Amphibians** are animals that can live both on land and in water. They have smooth, moist skin and typically undergo a metamorphosis (change in form) during their life cycle.
* **Toads** are a type of amphibian. They are known for their warty skin and hopping gait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Will has larger bones than most people. (1) Will is overweight.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The euphemism big-boned suggests that Will is overweight."	"The correct answer is **(1) Will is overweight.**

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  ""Big-boned"" is a euphemism for being overweight. It's a gentler way of saying someone is larger than average. 
* **Context:** The sentence implies that Will's size makes it necessary for him to shop in the men's department, even though he's in middle school. This suggests his size is not typical for his age group.

While it's technically true that everyone has bones, the phrase ""big-boned"" is rarely used to describe someone's skeletal structure. It's almost always a euphemism for being overweight.

 Solution: The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses abbreviated language (TBD).
The first sentence does not use abbreviated language, so it is more formal."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Sentence (1) is more formal.**

Here's why:

* **""TBD"" (To Be Determined)** is an informal abbreviation commonly used in casual settings like text messages or emails. Using it in a formal context like a library announcement would be inappropriate.
* **Sentence (1) is clear and concise,** avoiding unnecessary abbreviations and using a more formal tone.

Therefore, Sentence (1) is the more appropriate and formal choice for a library announcement.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnet's magnetic field depends on its size. Larger magnets have stronger magnetic fields. 
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:** In Pair 1, both magnets are the same size. In Pair 2, the blue magnet is smaller than the blue magnet in Pair 1. 
* **Force Relationship:** Since the blue magnet in Pair 2 is smaller, its magnetic field is weaker. This means the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.

 Solution: Most humans are born with five toes on each foot. So, having five toes is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(0) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes.  The number of toes a person has is determined by their genes.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences. Jerry's toe count wasn't something he developed; he was born with it.

256	256	"Question: Based on this information, what is Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Toriel is a horse from this group. Toriel has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Toriel's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Toriel's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Toriel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Toriel's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Toriel's genotype is LL, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele (L) for black coat color.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
* **Phenotype:** Since Toriel has at least one dominant allele (L), her phenotype, or physical expression of the gene, will be a black coat.

A grasshopper is an insect. Like other insects, a grasshopper is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has a hard outer cover."	"The answer is **(1) pig**. 

Here's why:

* **Vertebrates** are animals with a backbone (spinal column). Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are all vertebrates.
* **Pigs** are mammals, and therefore have backbones.
* **Grasshoppers** are insects, which are **invertebrates**. They lack a backbone and have an exoskeleton instead.

260	260	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
a copper statue turning green
baking an apple pie
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Copper Statue Turning Green:** This is a chemical change called oxidation. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air to form a new substance, copper oxide, which is green. 
* **Baking an Apple Pie:** This is also a chemical change. The heat of the oven causes the ingredients to undergo chemical reactions. The starches in the crust brown, the sugars in the apples caramelize, and the proteins in the filling change structure.  

**Key Point:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties. Physical changes only alter the appearance or form of a substance, not its chemical composition.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 15 ounces (1) 15 pounds (2) 15 tons
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the mass of a school bus is 15 tons.
15 ounces and 15 pounds are both too light."	"You are absolutely right! The answer is **(2) 15 tons**. 

Here's why:

* **15 ounces** is the weight of a small apple, far too light for a bus.
* **15 pounds** is roughly the weight of a large dog, still too light for a bus.
* **15 tons** is a very reasonable weight for a school bus. 

It's important to remember that school buses come in different sizes, so 15 tons is just an estimate, but it's the closest to the actual weight.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) simile (1) metaphor
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: From across the room, Uncle Ronald's laughter was booming thunder.
The words laughter and thunder are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"The answer is **(1) metaphor**. 

Here's why:

* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly compares two unlike things without using ""like"" or ""as"". In this sentence, Uncle Ronald's laughter is *being compared to* booming thunder.
* **Simile:** A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two unlike things. For example, ""Uncle Ronald's laughter was like booming thunder.""

A ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.
A hammer is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A hammer is made of iron and wood. Both iron and wood are solids.
Wet paint is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour wet paint out of a can, the paint will change shape. But the wet paint will still take up the same amount of space."	"The answer is **(2) wet paint**. 

Here's why:

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The cap was a good fit. (1) The cap was too big.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Fits you well ironically suggests that the cap was too big. The cap was falling over Paula's eyes, so it didn't fit her well at all."	"The correct answer is **(1) The cap was too big.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that contradicts their true meaning. Bobby says ""That fits you well,"" but the context makes it clear that the cap is not a good fit. 
* The repeated falling of the cap emphasizes that it's too big and doesn't fit Paula properly. 

By saying ""That fits you well"" while the cap is clearly too large, Bobby is being ironic.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Erosion caused by wind:**  The wind simply moves the rock particles. The composition of the rock itself doesn't change. This is a physical change.
* **Mixing sand and water:**  Sand and water combine but don't change their chemical makeup. This is a physical change. 

**Important to remember:**

* **Physical changes** alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical composition.

272	272	"Question: Which of the following organisms is the tertiary consumer in this food web?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) copepod (1) rotifer (2) green algae
 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a secondary consumer, so the copepod is a tertiary consumer.
The rotifer has arrows pointing to it from the green algae and the water flea. Neither the green algae nor the water flea is a secondary consumer, so the rotifer is not a tertiary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the rotifer and the shiner. The rotifer and the shiner are secondary consumers, so the black crappie is a tertiary consumer.
The green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a tertiary consumer."	"The answer is **(0) copepod**. 

Here's why:

* **Tertiary consumers** eat secondary consumers. 
* In the food web, the copepod eats the rotifer.
* The rotifer is a secondary consumer because it eats primary consumers (like the water flea).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) rotifer:**  The rotifer eats the water flea, which is a primary consumer, making the rotifer a secondary consumer.
* **(2) green algae:** Green algae are producers, meaning they make their own food and are not consumed by other organisms in this food web.

273	273	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree.
 Solution: When a megabat eats a fig, the megabat gets the food it needs to survive and grow. So the megabat benefits from its relationship with the fig tree.
Both the fig tree and its seeds have a better chance of surviving when the bat moves the seeds to a new location. So, the fig tree also benefits from its relationship with the megabat.
Since both the megabat and the fig tree benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location."	"The answer is **(1) mutualistic**. 

Here's why:

* **Mutualistic:** Both organisms benefit from the relationship. In this case, the megabat gets food, and the fig tree gets its seeds dispersed, increasing its chances of reproduction. 

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **Parasitic:** One organism benefits at the expense of the other. This is not the case here, as both the bat and the fig tree benefit.
* **Commensal:** One organism benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor helped.  While the bat clearly benefits, the fig tree also benefits from seed dispersal.

The eggs, oil, and vinegar look different when they are mixed together. But, their molecules do not change."	"The answer is **(0) physical change**. 

You are absolutely correct! Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A physical change alters the appearance or form of a substance but doesn't change its chemical composition.  Mixing ingredients like eggs, oil, and vinegar creates a new *texture* and *appearance* but the underlying chemical makeup of those ingredients remains the same.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:**  Pair 1 has a larger distance between the magnets (0.65 cm) compared to Pair 2 (0.3 cm). 

Since the distance is greater in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets will be weaker.

Here's why:

* **Fewer stores = less supply:** When the number of stores selling a specific product decreases, there are fewer places for people to buy that product. This means the overall supply of that product likely decreases. 
* **Direct relationship:** In this case, the number of men's clothing stores directly relates to the supply of men's shirts. Fewer stores mean fewer shirts available for sale.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 3:1 (2) 0:4 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of Channel catfish, some individuals have a brown body and others have a white body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white body (b) is recessive to the allele for a brown body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two Channel catfish.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a white body or a brown body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a white body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a brown body.
A white body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a white body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A brown body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a brown body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a white body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a brown body."	"The answer is **(2) 0:4**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Trait:** A white body is a recessive trait, meaning an offspring needs two copies of the recessive allele (bb) to express it.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes are either BB or Bb, both of which result in a brown body. There are no offspring with the bb genotype.

Therefore, the expected ratio of white body to brown body offspring is 0:4, meaning all offspring will have a brown body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The hickory tree will use up more space than the carnations would have used up. (1) Henry will get to look at the hickory tree. He thinks it will look more beautiful than the carnations would have looked.
 Hint: Henry is deciding whether to plant carnations or a hickory tree in his backyard. He wants to make his backyard more beautiful. But he also wants to leave space for doing fun things.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Henry wants or needs:
The hickory tree will use up more space than the carnations would have used up."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Option (0) is a cost** because it represents a trade-off. By planting the hickory tree, Henry is giving up the space he could have used for other activities or for planting more carnations. 

* **Option (1) is a benefit**  because it highlights a positive outcome of planting the hickory tree. Henry enjoys the beauty of the tree. 

**Key takeaway:** Costs represent things given up or sacrificed when making a choice. In this case, the space taken up by the tree is a cost compared to the space available for other uses.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder soccer ball (1) the hotter soccer ball
 Hint: Two soccer balls are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two soccer balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder soccer ball has less thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(0) the colder soccer ball**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.
* The higher the temperature, the faster the particles move, and the more thermal energy the object has.

Since both soccer balls are identical except for temperature, the colder soccer ball has lower average particle motion and therefore less thermal energy.

The correct answer is **(1) Lola will give up the chance to go on the flying bobsled. She would have had more fun on that ride.**

Here's why:

* **Cost in Economics:**  In economics, a cost is something you give up when you make a choice. It's not just about money, but also about the value of the best alternative you forgo.
* **Lola's Decision:**  Lola is choosing the Scorpion.  The cost of that decision is that she can't go on the Flying Bobsled, which she believes would have been more fun.  She's giving up the opportunity for that enjoyment.

The other choice (0) is not a cost.  It describes a potential benefit of choosing the Scorpion (saving ride tickets), but it doesn't represent something Lola is giving up.

347	347	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 3:1 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele for white wool (L) is dominant over the allele for black wool (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black wool or white wool, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for white wool, is dominant over the l allele, which is for black wool.
Black wool is the recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the wool color trait must have only recessive alleles for the wool color gene. So, offspring with black wool must have the genotype ll.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ll.
White wool is the dominant allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the wool color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wool color gene. So, offspring with white wool must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black wool. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with white wool."	"The answer is **(2) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Trait:** Black wool is a recessive trait, meaning an offspring needs two copies of the recessive allele (ll) to express it.
* **Punnett Square:**  All four boxes in the Punnett square show the genotype ""ll"" (black wool).
* **Dominant Trait:** White wool is a dominant trait, meaning an offspring only needs one copy of the dominant allele (L) to express it. 
* **No White Wool:**  There are no boxes in the Punnett square showing a genotype with at least one ""L"" allele (LL or Ll).

Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool is 4:0.

Cara has naturally brown hair.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) inherited (1) acquired
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Some people dye their hair. But this does not change their natural hair color.
Children get their natural hair color from their parents. So, Cara's hair color is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(0) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Hair color is a classic example of an inherited trait.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences. While hair color can be changed through dyeing, this is an acquired trait, not a change in the natural hair color.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Hakim. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim.
 Hint: Hakim is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Hakim with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Hakim with a force of 400N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Hakim, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Hakim down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Hakim up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim.** 

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:** When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out. This means the object they act upon will either stay at rest or continue moving at a constant speed in the same direction.
* **Hakim's Situation:** Gravity pulls Hakim down (400N), but the diving board pushes him up with an equal and opposite force (400N). These forces balance each other.
* **Net Force:** Since the forces are balanced, the net force on Hakim is zero. This means he's not accelerating; he's either standing still or moving at a constant speed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a school bus carrying 600 pounds (1) a school bus carrying 500 pounds
 Hint: Kids from two different schools are riding their school buses home. The buses are the same. They are going the same speed. But different numbers of kids are riding in each bus.
 Solution: Look for the school bus that is heavier.
A school bus carrying 600 pounds is heavier than a school bus carrying 500 pounds. So, the school bus carrying 600 pounds needs a larger force to come to a stop in the same amount of time as the other bus."	"The answer is **(0) a school bus carrying 600 pounds**. 

Here's why:

* **Newton's Second Law of Motion:**  This law states that the force needed to accelerate an object is directly proportional to its mass. In simpler terms, the heavier the object, the more force is needed to change its motion. 
* **Stopping is a Change in Motion:**  When a bus stops, it goes from moving to being stationary, which is a change in motion.
* **Heavier Bus = More Force Needed:** Since the bus carrying 600 pounds is heavier than the bus carrying 500 pounds, it will require a larger force to stop in the same amount of time.

369	369	"Question: Which of the following organisms is the omnivore in this food web?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) shiner (1) black crappie (2) copepod
 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The black crappie has three arrows pointing to it. These arrows start from the rotifer, the water flea, and the shiner, which are all consumers. So, the black crappie is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The rotifer has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae, which is a producer. The rotifer also has an arrow pointing to it from the water flea, which is a consumer. The rotifer eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the golden algae, which is a producer. The copepod also has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer, which is a consumer. The copepod eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The shiner has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the water flea, which is a consumer. So, the shiner is a consumer but not an omnivore."	The answer is (2).	natural science

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.** 

Here's why:

* **The size of the magnet matters:** The strength of a magnet's magnetic field, and thus the force it exerts, depends on its size. Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields.
* **Comparing the pairs:** In Pair 1, the green magnet (Magnet A) is the same size as the green magnet in Pair 2. However, the purple magnet (Magnet B) in Pair 1 is smaller than the purple magnet in Pair 2. 
* **The result:**  Since Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1, the overall magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2.

376	376	"Question: Based on this information, what is Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy fleece (1) a woolly fleece
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
Sage is a sheep from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype FF for the fleece type gene.
 Solution: Sage's genotype for the fleece type gene is FF. Sage's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for a hairy fleece. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Sage's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece."	"The correct answer is **(0) a hairy fleece**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Sage's genotype is FF, meaning she has two copies of the dominant ""hairy fleece"" allele (F).
* **Dominant Allele:**  The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This means that if an individual has at least one F allele, they will have a hairy fleece. 
* **Phenotype:** Since Sage has two F alleles, her phenotype (the physical expression of the genotype) is a hairy fleece.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Tyler must be fiscally irresponsible, because he works for a company that went bankrupt. However, even though his company is perceived as fiscally irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Tyler is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association**  involves judging an individual based on their association with a group or entity, even if the individual themselves is not directly responsible for the group's actions.

Last winter, Henry took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect."	"You are absolutely correct! The second text uses the word ""ironic"" in its traditional sense. 

Here's why:

* **Traditional ""ironic""**:  This refers to a situation where the outcome is the opposite of what was expected, often in a humorous way. In the second text, Henry went to Florida to escape the snow, but ended up coincidentally missing his friends who were there the week before. This is a humorous twist of fate.
* **Nontraditional ""ironic""**: This is often used to describe a situation that is simply coincidental or unexpected, without the element of humor or contrast. The first text uses ""ironic"" in this way, simply noting that a snowstorm happened while Henry was in Florida. There's no real irony or humor in the situation, just an unexpected event.

Draco, a government official in seventh-century Athens, Greece, wrote a code of laws that called for severe punishments for even minor offenses.
The allusion draconian means harsh."	"The answer is **(1) Greek history**. 

Here's why:

* **Draconian** is an adjective that refers to something extremely harsh or severe. 
* **Draco** was an Athenian lawmaker in the 7th century BC, known for his extremely strict and unforgiving legal code. His laws were so severe that they were described as ""draconian,"" which is where the term originates.

391	391	"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Did you really vote for Edgar as class treasurer? Didn't you hear that his uncle was imprisoned for embezzling $1.5 million?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Edgar can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Edgar can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is a fallacy where someone is judged negatively based on the actions or characteristics of someone they are associated with (in this case, Edgar's uncle). 
* **Straw man** involves misrepresenting an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack.  This isn't happening in the text.

The text is trying to discredit Edgar by associating him with his uncle's criminal past, even though there's no direct evidence that Edgar shares the same character traits.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) buzzing (1) dripping (2) banging
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the picture.
The word banging describes the sound this hammer makes.
Dripping and buzzing can also describe sounds. But they do not describe the sounds this hammer makes."	"The answer is **(2) banging**. 

Here's why:

* **Banging** is the sound you typically associate with a hammer hitting a nail. 
* **Buzzing** is a continuous, high-pitched sound.
* **Dripping** is the sound of liquid falling in drops. 

The picture clearly shows a hammer being used to drive a nail, which creates a banging sound.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 17 cups (1) 17 gallons (2) 17 fluid ounces
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the volume of a water balloon is 17 fluid ounces.
17 cups and 17 gallons are both too much."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why 17 fluid ounces is the best estimate:

* **17 cups:**  A cup is a pretty big measurement. A water balloon wouldn't hold that much water.
* **17 gallons:**  Gallons are even larger!  Think of a large bucket or a small trash can.  A water balloon wouldn't hold that much water.
* **17 fluid ounces:** This is a reasonable volume for a typical water balloon. It's about the size of a small bottle of soda.

**Therefore, 17 fluid ounces is the best estimate for the volume of a water balloon.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Shawna will give up some muffins. She could have made more cranberry muffins than coffee cake muffins. (1) Shawna will get to eat coffee cake muffins. She thinks coffee cake muffins are tastier than cranberry muffins.
 Hint: Shawna is deciding whether to bake coffee cake muffins or cranberry muffins. She wants the muffins to be tasty. But she also wants to make a lot of muffins.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Shawna wants or needs:
Shawna will give up some muffins. She could have made more cranberry muffins than coffee cake muffins."	"You're absolutely right! The correct answer is **(0) Shawna will give up some muffins. She could have made more cranberry muffins than coffee cake muffins.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:**  In economics, a cost represents something you sacrifice or give up when making a decision. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** The specific cost in this scenario is called an *opportunity cost*. This is the value of the next best alternative that you forgo when you choose one option over another.
* **Shawna's Dilemma:** Shawna is choosing between coffee cake muffins and cranberry muffins. By choosing coffee cake, she's giving up the opportunity to make more cranberry muffins (since she has a limited amount of ingredients, time, etc.). 

**Let's break down why the other choice is incorrect:**

* **(1) Shawna will get to eat coffee cake muffins. She thinks coffee cake muffins are tastier than cranberry muffins.**  This is a benefit, not a cost. It describes something positive that Shawna gains from her decision.

You look as if you're licking some invisible something on your lips.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) assonance (1) euphemism
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses assonance, the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words.
The words if, licking, invisible, and lips share a vowel sound."	"The answer is **(0) assonance**. 

Here's why:

* **Assonance** is the repetition of vowel sounds within a phrase or sentence. In the given text, the repeated vowel sound is ""i"" (as in ""if"", ""licking"", ""invisible"", and ""lips""). 

Let's break down why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Euphemism** is the use of a mild or indirect expression instead of one considered harsh or blunt. This is not present in the given text. 

The use of assonance in this example creates a slightly humorous and light-hearted tone, drawing attention to the action described.

Leslie rubbed coconut oil on her hands, which were like the parched earth during a drought.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Leslie's hands were dry and cracked. (1) Leslie was baking something.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text includes a simile, using like or as to compare two things that are not actually alike.
The simile like the parched earth during a drought suggests that Leslie's hands were dry and cracked. A drought is a period without rain; the ground during a drought can become hard and cracked."	"The correct answer is **(0) Leslie's hands were dry and cracked.** 

Here's why:

* **Simile:** The sentence uses the simile ""like the parched earth during a drought"" to compare Leslie's hands to something else. 
* **Meaning:**  ""Parched earth during a drought"" is a vivid image of dry, cracked soil. This implies that Leslie's hands were in a similar condition, likely due to dryness. 

The other choice is incorrect because the text doesn't mention anything about baking.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Potassium feldspar is a solid. It is not made by living things. (1) Turquoise is formed in nature. It is a solid. (2) Plastic is made in a factory. It is a solid.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Potassium feldspar is a mineral.
Plastic is made in a factory. But all minerals are formed in nature.
So, plastic is not a mineral.
Turquoise is a mineral."	"The correct answer is **(2) Plastic is made in a factory. It is a solid.**

Here's why:

* **Minerals** are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a defined chemical composition and a crystalline structure. 
* **Plastic** is a synthetic material, meaning it's created by humans. 

While plastic is solid, it doesn't meet the criteria of being naturally occurring and having a defined crystalline structure.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of pink particles."	"The answer is **(1) Solution B**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution B** has a higher concentration of pink particles because it has more pink particles in the same volume of solvent (45 mL) as Solution A.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real quick).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the conversational language, so it is more formal overall."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Sentence (0) is more formal.**

Here's why:

* **""Real quick""** is a colloquial phrase, commonly used in informal speech and writing.
* **""Quickly""** is a more formal and standard way to express the same idea. 

The use of ""real quick"" in Sentence (1) makes it sound casual and less professional.

water evaporating from a puddle
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But pouring milk on oatmeal is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Physical Changes:**  These changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical composition.
    * **Pouring milk on oatmeal:** The milk and oatmeal mix, changing their appearance, but they remain milk and oatmeal.
    * **Water evaporating:**  Water changes from a liquid to a gas (water vapor), but it's still chemically the same H₂O molecules.

* **Chemical Changes:** These changes result in the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions.  Neither of the examples given involve the creation of new substances.

The only arrow pointing from the black rockfish leads to the kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the black rockfish to the sea cucumber.. kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.. bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bat star to the sea cucumber.."	"The answer is (1) kelp. Here's why:

* **Follow the Arrows:**  The arrows in the food web show how energy and matter move from one organism to another.
* **Path to Sea Cucumber:** You need to find a path of arrows leading from one of the choices to the sea cucumber. There is a path from kelp:

 Choices: (0) Greek mythology (1) modern history
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion chimerical is Greek mythology.
According to Greek mythology, a Chimera was an improbable fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.
The allusion chimerical means fanciful."	"The correct answer is **(0) Greek mythology**. 

Here's why:

* **Chimerical** refers to something that is wildly imaginative, unrealistic, or a mixture of different things. This meaning comes directly from the Greek mythical creature known as the Chimera. 

The sentence uses ""chimerical creatures"" to describe the artist's drawings, implying that these creatures are fantastical and don't exist in reality. The mention of mundane settings like bus stations and laundromats further highlights the contrast between the fantastical and the everyday, adding to the impact of the allusion.

Walter's ill-researched essay about the Space Race received a poor grade because it presented such a travesty of the actual historical events.
The second text uses travesty in its nontraditional sense: a disappointment or a tragedy.
Walter realized that his essay about the Space Race was a bit inaccurate, but he still thought it a travesty that such an entertaining essay should receive a poor grade.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word travesty because it is considered more standard."	"The correct answer is **(0) Walter's ill-researched essay about the Space Race received a poor grade because it presented such a travesty of the actual historical events.**

Here's why:

* **Travesty** in its traditional sense means a distorted or grossly exaggerated imitation of something, often presented in a way that makes it ridiculous or absurd. 

* In choice (0), Walter's essay is described as a ""travesty"" of the real historical events. This implies his essay was a distorted and inaccurate representation of the actual Space Race, making it a poor imitation.

* Choice (1) uses ""travesty"" in a more modern, colloquial sense, meaning something that is unfair or unjust.  While Walter's essay might have been inaccurate, the word ""travesty"" doesn't accurately describe the situation in this context.

Most of the people who knew Grayson considered him to be an unrepentant Casanova.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Greek mythology (1) history
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Casanova is history.
The autobiography of Giovanni Giacomo Casanova, an eighteenth-century Italian adventurer, details and perhaps exaggerates his amorous adventures and success with women.
The allusion Casanova means a womanizer."	"The answer is **(1) history**. 

Here's why:

* **Casanova** is not a figure from Greek mythology. 
* **Casanova** refers to **Giovanni Giacomo Casanova**, a real historical figure known for his romantic exploits and documented in his autobiography.  

The sentence uses ""Casanova"" as an allusion, meaning it references a well-known figure or event to create a specific meaning or image. In this case, it suggests that Grayson is a charming and successful womanizer, similar to the historical Casanova.

 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Jeanette and Bryant were taking a snowboarding class. During the class, their instructor said they would go faster if they applied wax to the undersides of their snowboards.
After the class, Jeanette applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of a snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. Bryant timed how long each ride took. Jeanette repeated these rides on four other snowboards, alternating whether she first rode with or without wax.
Figure: a snowboarder.
 Solution: In this experiment, Jeanette and Bryant investigated whether adding wax to snowboards affects their speed. There was no wax on the snowboards with wax removed. So, they were part of a control group."	"The answer is **(0) the snowboards with wax removed**. 

Here's why:

* **Control Group:** A control group in an experiment is used as a baseline for comparison. It doesn't receive the treatment being tested (in this case, the wax). 
* **Experimental Group:** The group that receives the treatment being tested (the wax) is the experimental group.

In this experiment, Jeanette tested two conditions for each snowboard: with wax and without wax. The snowboards with wax removed represent the control group because they didn't have the wax applied. They were used to compare the speed of the snowboards with wax applied.

(1) The crown-of-thorns starfish is a consumer in its ecosystem, so it eats other organisms for food. Crown-of-thorns starfish eat coral and are known for damaging coral reefs.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: This organism is photosynthetic:
The text tells you that a barrel cactus is a producer that uses energy from sunlight to make its own food. This is evidence that the barrel cactus is a photosynthetic organism.
This organism is not photosynthetic:
The text does not provide evidence that the crown-of-thorns starfish is photosynthetic."	"The answer is **(0) The barrel cactus is a producer in its ecosystem, so the cactus makes its own food inside its cells. The barrel cactus lives in deserts and uses energy from sunlight to make food.**

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis:** The process of using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create food is called photosynthesis.  Producers like plants are the only organisms that can perform photosynthesis.
* **The text states:** The barrel cactus is a producer that uses energy from sunlight to make food. This directly indicates that it is photosynthetic. 

The crown-of-thorns starfish, on the other hand, is a consumer, meaning it gets its food by eating other organisms. This is not a characteristic of photosynthetic organisms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) ll
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for a black coat, and the allele l is for a red coat.
Echo, a cow from this group, has a red coat. Echo has two alleles for a red coat.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the coat color trait is a red coat. So, Echo's phenotype for the coat color trait is a red coat."	"The correct answer is **(0) a red coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the genetic makeup).
* The information states that Echo has a **red coat**, which is the observable characteristic. 
* Therefore, Echo's phenotype for the coat color trait is **a red coat**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

The strength of a magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnets.  This means that as the distance between magnets decreases, the force between them increases.

In this case, Pair 2 has a smaller distance between the magnets than Pair 1, therefore the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 is stronger."	natural science

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first text uses random in its traditional sense: made or occurring without a definite pattern.
At the grocery store, Martina hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food.
The second text uses random in its nontraditional sense: odd or out of place.
Martina made a random trip to the grocery store, though her kitchen was already stocked with a hodgepodge of food.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word random because it is generally considered incorrect."	"The correct answer is **(1) At the grocery store, Martina hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food.**

Here's why:

* **Choice (1)** uses ""random"" to describe the way Martina was selecting items. She wasn't picking specific things; she was grabbing whatever was available in a haphazard, unpredictable manner. This aligns with the traditional meaning of ""random"" as occurring without a pattern. 

* **Choice (0)** uses ""random"" to describe the trip itself. It implies that the trip was unplanned or unexpected, not necessarily that Martina was selecting things without a pattern.  This usage of ""random"" is more colloquial and can be considered incorrect by some style guides.

The explanation provided in the solution accurately identifies the traditional and nontraditional uses of ""random,"" reinforcing the importance of choosing the most accurate and precise language.

 Solution: The best estimate for the length of a garden rake is 6 feet.
6 inches is too short. 6 yards and 6 miles are too long."	"The solution is correct! Here's why:

* **6 inches** is about the length of a hand, way too short for a rake.
* **6 yards** is about the length of a car, much too long for a garden rake.
* **6 miles** is an extremely long distance, obviously not the length of a rake.
* **6 feet** is a reasonable size for a tool like a garden rake.

 Hint: Hint: Riding a motorcycle well takes practice.
 Solution: People are not born knowing how to ride a motorcycle. Instead, many people learn how to ride. So, riding a motorcycle is an acquired trait."	"The answer is **(0) acquired**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down genetically from parents to offspring.  Examples include eye color, hair color, and certain predispositions to diseases.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime through learning, experience, or environmental factors.  

Riding a motorcycle is a skill that is learned through practice and experience, not something someone is born with.

473	473	"Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnet's magnetic field, and therefore the force it exerts, is directly related to its size. Larger magnets have stronger magnetic fields.

* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:** In Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than Magnet B in Pair 2. Since the smaller magnet has a weaker magnetic field, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker.

* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** The fact that Pair 1's magnets attract and Pair 2's magnets repel only affects the direction of the force, not its magnitude.

 Solution: A gray heron's scientific name is Ardea cinerea.
Lonicera japonica does not have the same scientific name as a gray heron. So, Ardea cinerea and Lonicera japonica are not in the same species.
Hyla cinerea does have the same species within its genus as a gray heron, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species.
Ardea cinerea has the same scientific name as a gray heron. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"The answer is **(0) Ardea cinerea**. 

Here's why:

* **Species Identification:**  The scientific name of an organism identifies its specific species.
* **Gray Heron's Scientific Name:** The gray heron's scientific name is *Ardea cinerea*.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Size:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is directly related to their size. Larger magnets have stronger magnetic fields and therefore exert a greater force. 
* **Comparison:** In the images, the blue magnet (Magnet A) is the same size in both pairs. However, the green magnet (Magnet B) is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. 

Since the green magnet in Pair 2 is larger, it will have a stronger magnetic field, leading to a greater magnetic force between the magnets in that pair.

489	489	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
carving a piece of wood
water boiling on a stove
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water boiling is caused by heating. But carving a piece of wood is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Carving wood:** This is a physical change because you're altering the shape and size of the wood, but not its chemical composition. It's still wood.
* **Water boiling:**  This is a change of state (liquid to gas), which is a physical change.  The water molecules themselves haven't changed their chemical makeup.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:**  This is wrong because neither change involves the formation of a new substance.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:**  This is wrong because only the boiling of water is caused by heating.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:** This is partially correct for the boiling water but incorrect for the wood carving.

""Someone had better turn on the heat,"" Lexi said, sweat glistening on her face.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The temperature was too warm. (1) The temperature was too cool.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Someone had better turn on the heat ironically suggests that the temperature was too warm. Lexi did not think that more heat was needed; she was already sweating."	"The correct answer is **(0) The temperature was too warm.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal Irony:** This type of irony occurs when someone says something that contradicts their true meaning.
* **Lexi's Statement:** Lexi says, ""Someone had better turn on the heat,"" which implies that the temperature is too cold.
* **The Context:** The text tells us that ""sweat glistening on her face."" This contradicts the implication of her statement, revealing that she's actually feeling very hot. 

Therefore, Lexi's statement is ironic, as she is actually complaining about the heat being too high.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Pelecanus philippensis (1) Strix uralensis (2) Ardea herodias
 Hint: This organism is an American white pelican. Its scientific name is Pelecanus erythrorhynchos.
 Solution: An American white pelican's scientific name is Pelecanus erythrorhynchos. The first word of its scientific name is Pelecanus.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Pelecanus erythrorhynchos are not in the same genus.
Pelecanus philippensis is in the genus Pelecanus. The first word of its scientific name is Pelecanus. So, Pelecanus philippensis and Pelecanus erythrorhynchos are in the same genus.
Strix uralensis is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix uralensis and Pelecanus erythrorhynchos are not in the same genus."	"The answer is **(0) Pelecanus philippensis**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:** The first part of a scientific name identifies the genus.  
* **American White Pelican:** The American white pelican's scientific name is *Pelecanus erythrorhynchos*.
* **Genus Match:** The scientific name *Pelecanus philippensis* also begins with ""Pelecanus"", indicating it's in the same genus. 

The other choices are in different genera:

* **(1) Strix uralensis:** Belongs to the genus *Strix*.

When Alana first joined the track team, she was afraid of jumping, but she got over that hurdle.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) verbal irony (1) pun
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a pun, a word or phrase that humorously suggests more than one meaning.
Hurdle refers to an obstacle that one must overcome. It also refers to an object that a runner jumps over."	"The correct answer is **(1) pun**. 

Here's why:

* **Pun:** A pun is a play on words that uses a word with multiple meanings or words that sound alike but have different meanings. In this case, ""hurdle"" is used both literally (an obstacle on the track) and figuratively (Alana's fear of jumping).

* **Verbal Irony:** Verbal irony occurs when a speaker says something that is the opposite of what they mean. This is not present in the text.

 Hint: Select the best answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
You can see clearly through a transparent object. All three objects are transparent.
A bouncy object will bounce back from the floor if you drop it. None of the objects are bouncy.
A lemon has a sour taste. The water is not sour.
The property that all three objects have in common is transparent."	"The answer is **(0) transparent**. 

Here's why:

* **Transparent:**  You can see through all three objects (glass bottle, glass flask, and water). 
* **Bouncy:** None of the objects are likely to bounce if dropped. 
* **Sour:** Only a lemon would be sour. 

Therefore, the common property is that all three objects are transparent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having Thomsen disease (1) mm
 Hint: This passage describes the Thomsen disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have Thomsen disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having Thomsen disease, and the allele m is for not having Thomsen disease.
Kenneth, a human from this group, does not have Thomsen disease. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease (m). So, Kenneth's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm."	"The correct answer is **(1) mm**. 

Here's why:

* **The information states:** Kenneth does not have Thomsen disease.
* **We know:** The allele 'm' is for not having Thomsen disease.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) There was a benefit to Devin's job loss. (1) Having to pursue a new career was the worst part of Devin's job loss.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a metaphor, comparing two things that are not actually alike without using like or as.
The metaphor the only light in the sea of darkness was the prospect of pursuing a new career suggests that there was a benefit to Devin's job loss. A light would be beneficial in helping someone escape a dark, difficult-to-navigate situation. Similarly, Devin's new career was beneficial in helping him escape the emotionally difficult experience of losing his job."	"The correct answer is **(0) There was a benefit to Devin's job loss.** 

Here's why:

* **Metaphor Explanation:** The text uses the metaphor ""the only light in the sea of darkness"" to describe the prospect of pursuing a new career. This comparison implies that the new career is a positive and hopeful aspect in the otherwise bleak situation of losing his job.
* **Light as a Symbol:**  Light is often used symbolically to represent hope, optimism, and a way forward. 
* **Sea of Darkness:**  The ""sea of darkness"" represents the overwhelming sadness and despair that Devin feels after losing his job.

Therefore, the metaphor suggests that while losing his job was devastating, the opportunity to pursue a new career offered a glimmer of hope and potential for a better future.

Covering its eggs with its body increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the leech's eggs will hatch (1) the leech will not eat for up to a week (2) the leech will fight a water snail
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After  reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream. The leech then flattens its body over its eggs to protect them. The leech protects its eggs until they hatch, which takes four to seven days. During this time, the leech does not leave the eggs or eat.
Water snails are predators that eat leech eggs. The snails easily eat eggs that are not covered by an adult leech. But snails cannot easily get to eggs that are covered by a leech.
Figure: a snail leech.
 Solution: Look for the part of the passage that describes the effect of covering its eggs with its body. Use this information to determine why this behavior can increase the reproductive success of the snail leech.
Choice ""The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After a snail leech reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream.

 Choices: (0) Life is luxurious. (1) Life is unpredictable.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text includes a simile, using like or as to compare two things that are not actually alike.
The simile life was like a box of chocolates suggests that life is unpredictable. You don't know what type of filling is inside a chocolate until you try it, just as you don't know what life holds for you until it happens."	"The correct answer is **(1) Life is unpredictable.**

Here's why:

* **Simile:** The text uses the simile ""life was like a box of chocolates"" to compare life to a box of chocolates. 
* **Unpredictability:** The key phrase ""You never know what you're gonna get"" emphasizes the uncertain nature of both chocolates and life. Just as you can't predict the flavor of a chocolate until you open it, you can't always predict what life will throw your way.

The simile does **not** suggest that life is luxurious. While chocolates can be a treat, the focus of the simile is on the element of surprise and uncertainty, not on luxury.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Wind turning a pinwheel is air that is moving! Air is a gas. The air expands to fill the space around the pinwheel."	"The answer is **(1) a gas**. 

Here's why:

* **Wind** is moving air. 
* **Air** is a mixture of gases, primarily nitrogen and oxygen. 
* **Gases** are one of the three states of matter, along with solids and liquids. 

So, the wind turning a pinwheel is the force of a gas (air) pushing on the pinwheel's blades.

Ed is big-boned, so despite being in middle school, he often shops in the men's department.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ed is tall for his age. (1) Ed is overweight.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The euphemism big-boned suggests that Ed is overweight."	"The correct answer is **(1) Ed is overweight**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  ""Big-boned"" is a euphemism for being overweight. It's a gentler way of saying someone is heavyset or obese.
* **Context:** The fact that Ed shops in the men's department despite being in middle school implies he's larger than average for his age. 

The phrase ""big-boned"" is a subtle way of avoiding directly saying ""overweight,"" which can be seen as insensitive.

How can I be expected to do my homework when billions of people around the world are throwing their plastic water bottles away without recycling them?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself (1) red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that people not recycling somehow prevents the speaker from doing homework. However, these two ideas aren't related. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a red herring."	"The correct answer is **(1) red herring**. 

Here's why:

* **Red Herring:** The statement uses a completely unrelated issue (plastic pollution) to distract from the original point (the speaker's inability to do homework).  It attempts to make the speaker's lack of homework seem less important by bringing up a larger, more emotionally charged issue. 

The speaker's inability to do homework and plastic pollution are not logically connected.  While both are important issues, they are not relevant to each other in this context.

 Choices: (0) sample B (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion and is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where 'm' is mass and 'v' is velocity (speed).
* **Temperature and KE:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  The higher the average KE, the higher the temperature.

In this case, both samples have the same average particle speed. However, the particles in sample B have twice the mass of the particles in sample A. Since KE is directly proportional to mass, the particles in sample B will have higher average KE, and therefore a higher temperature.

542	542	"Question: Based on this information, what is Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a reddish-brown coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Astro is a horse from this group. Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Astro's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Astro's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(0) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Astro's genotype is Ll, meaning he has one dominant allele (L) for black coat and one recessive allele (l) for reddish-brown coat.
* **Dominant Allele:**  The allele for black coat (L) is dominant. This means that even with one copy of the dominant allele, the dominant trait will be expressed.
* **Phenotype:**  The phenotype is the physical expression of the genes. Since Astro has the dominant allele (L), his phenotype is a black coat, even though he also carries the recessive allele for reddish-brown.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample B**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  Higher kinetic energy means higher temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula: KE = (1/2)mv², where 'm' is the mass and 'v' is the velocity (speed). 
* **Comparison:** Both samples have particles with the same mass.  However, sample B has a higher average particle speed (800 m/s) compared to sample A (620 m/s).  Since speed is squared in the kinetic energy formula, the higher speed of particles in sample B means they have a higher average kinetic energy, and therefore a higher temperature.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**. Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It depends on both mass and speed.  The formula is: KE = 1/2 * mv² (where m = mass and v = velocity)

* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * Sample A has particles with a higher mass (46 u) and higher average speed (690 m/s) than Sample B.
    * Both of these factors (higher mass and higher speed) contribute to a higher kinetic energy for the particles in Sample A.

Abby thinks Mr. Larson is a Luddite because he doesn't own a cell phone.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Roman history (1) British history
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Luddite is British history.
In the early nineteenth century, factories were replacing the jobs of craftsmen. Some of these craftsmen banded together to destroy the new machinery; those who did so were called Luddites.
The allusion Luddite means a person opposed to new technology."	"The correct answer is **(1) British history**. 

Here's why:

* **The Luddites** were a group of English textile workers in the early 19th century who protested against the introduction of new machinery that they believed was threatening their jobs.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same."	"The answer is (1) neither; their concentrations are the same. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given volume of solvent.  
* **Solution A** has 5 yellow particles in 25 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** also has 5 yellow particles in 25 mL of solvent.

Since both solutions have the same number of solute particles in the same volume, their concentrations are equal.

In this work are exhibited in a very high degree the two most engaging powers of an author. New things are made familiar, and familiar things are made new.
—Samuel Johnson, Lives of the English Poets
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chiasmus (1) apostrophe
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses chiasmus, an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words.
The second time they appear, the words new and familiar are in reverse order."	"The correct answer is **(0) chiasmus**. 

Here's why:

* **Chiasmus** is a rhetorical device where the second part of a phrase or clause is structured as a mirror image of the first part, but with the elements reversed. 

In the quote:

* **First part:** ""New things are made familiar""
* **Second part:** ""and familiar things are made new""

The words ""new"" and ""familiar"" are reversed in the second part, creating the characteristic mirror-like structure of chiasmus. 

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Apostrophe** is a figure of speech where a speaker directly addresses a person who is absent, a personified object, or an abstract concept. This isn't present in the text.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) EE
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for red eyes, and the allele e is for black eyes.
Zora, a koi fish from this group, has red eyes. Zora has two alleles for red eyes.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Zora has two alleles for red eyes (E). So, Zora's genotype for the eye color gene is EE."	"The solution is correct. Here's a breakdown:

* **Understanding the information:** We know the following:
    * Red eyes are determined by the dominant allele ""E"".
    * Black eyes are determined by the recessive allele ""e"".
    * Zora has red eyes.
* **Deduction:** Since Zora has red eyes, she must have at least one ""E"" allele.  The fact that she has **two alleles** for red eyes means she has two ""E"" alleles.
* **Genotype:** Therefore, Zora's genotype for the eye color gene is **EE**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the rock with more mass (1) the rock with less mass
 Hint: The objects are made of the same type of matter.
 Solution: The two rocks have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the rock with less mass has less thermal energy."	"The answer is **(1) the rock with less mass**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total kinetic energy of the particles within an object. This means it's directly related to how much the particles are moving.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles.  
* **Mass** represents the amount of matter in an object.

Since both rocks have the same temperature, their particles have the same average kinetic energy. However, the rock with less mass has fewer particles. Therefore, the total kinetic energy (thermal energy) of the smaller rock will be less.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a motorboat that moved 355kilometers in 5hours (1) a motorboat that moved 65kilometers in 5hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One motorboat moved 355 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other motorboat moved 65 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each motorboat spent the same amount of time moving. The motorboat that moved 355 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at a higher speed."	"The solution is correct! Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time:**  Speed = Distance / Time
* **Both boats traveled for the same time (5 hours):** This makes comparing their distances a direct comparison of their speeds.
* **The boat that traveled 355 kilometers traveled a greater distance:**  Since it covered more distance in the same amount of time, it must have been moving faster. 

**Therefore, the motorboat that moved 355 kilometers in 5 hours was moving at a higher speed.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 3:1 (2) 4:0 (3) 1:3 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the H allele, which is for not having horns, is dominant over the h allele, which is for having horns.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to offspring that have horns is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have horns. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have horns."	"The answer is **(2) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Trait:** The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant. This means that if an offspring inherits at least one H allele, it will not have horns.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes (HH, HH, HH, HH) have at least one H allele.
* **No Recessive Genotype:** There is no possibility of an offspring inheriting the recessive genotype (hh) which is required for having horns.

Therefore, all offspring are expected to have the dominant trait (no horns), resulting in a 4:0 ratio.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Freedom of speech and trial by jury are two important rights in the United States Constitution. (1) Mackenzie and her mom sat on the back porch and watched as the sun sank into the horizon.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first sentence is the complex sentence. It is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause begins with the subordinating conjunction as.
Mackenzie and her mom sat on the back porch and watched as the sun sank into the horizon."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why the first sentence is a complex sentence:

* **Independent Clause:** ""Freedom of speech and trial by jury are two important rights"" - This clause can stand alone as a complete sentence. 
* **Dependent Clause:** ""in the United States Constitution"" - This clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and depends on the independent clause for meaning. It is connected by the subordinating conjunction ""in"".

585	585	"Question: Based on this information, what is Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.
 Solution: Cheyenne's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Cheyenne's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"The answer is **(0) not having horns**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Cheyenne's genotype is HH, meaning she has two copies of the dominant ""H"" allele.
* **Dominant Allele:** The ""H"" allele is dominant, meaning it masks the expression of the recessive ""h"" allele.
* **Phenotype:**  Since Cheyenne has two dominant ""H"" alleles, her phenotype will be determined by the dominant allele, resulting in her not having horns.

sewing an apron
water evaporating from a lake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But sewing an apron is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Sewing an apron:** This is a physical change. You're altering the shape of the fabric, but not changing its chemical composition. The fabric is still the same material.
* **Water evaporating:** This is also a physical change. Water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state (water vapor), but the chemical makeup of the water (H2O) remains the same. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can cause evaporation, sewing an apron doesn't involve heating.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:**  Neither change involves creating new substances.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** Cooling would likely condense water vapor, the opposite of evaporation. Sewing an apron isn't related to cooling.

 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cactus.
 Hint: Ariana is picking up her potted cactus as she cleans her room. She is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20N. Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on the cactus, look at the forces:
Ariana is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20 N.
Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 20 N and 15 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced forces:** The forces acting on the cactus are not equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. Ariana's upward pull (20N) is stronger than gravity's downward pull (15N). 
* **Net force:**  The net force is the overall force acting on an object. In this case, there is a net upward force of 5N (20N - 15N). This means the cactus will accelerate upwards. 

**Key takeaway:**  For forces to be balanced, they must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. If they are not, there is a net force, resulting in acceleration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bird that moved 15miles in 5hours (1) a bird that moved 25miles in 5hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each bird moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bird moved 25 miles in 5 hours.
The other bird moved 15 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each bird spent the same amount of time moving. The bird that moved 25 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bird must have moved at a higher speed."	"The correct answer is **(1) a bird that moved 25 miles in 5 hours**. 

Here's why:

* **Speed** is calculated by dividing distance by time.
* **Bird 1:** 15 miles / 5 hours = 3 miles per hour
* **Bird 2:** 25 miles / 5 hours = 5 miles per hour

Since Bird 2 traveled a greater distance in the same amount of time, it was moving at a higher speed.

Mr. Leonard can quit smoking because he's capable of stopping.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself (1) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations (2) ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Mr. Leonard can quit smoking because he is able to stop. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."	"The correct answer is **(0) circular reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **Circular reasoning** is a fallacy where the argument uses the conclusion itself as evidence. In this case, the argument states Mr. Leonard can quit because he's capable of stopping. The statement ""he's capable of stopping"" assumes he *can* quit, which is what the argument is trying to prove.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Hasty generalization** involves making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence.  This isn't relevant to the text.
* **(2) Ad hominem** attacks the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. This is not present in the text.

631	631	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a lake
ice crystals forming on a window
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Ice crystals forming on a window is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air can change directly into ice when it touches a very cold window! A change of state from a gas to a solid is called depositing.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But ice crystals forming on a window is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Ice crystals form on a window when water vapor in the air becomes ice. This is caused by cooling. But water evaporating from a lake is not."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Physical Changes:** These changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical composition. 
    * **Evaporation:**  Water (H₂O) changes from a liquid to a gas (water vapor) but remains chemically the same.
    * **Freezing:** Water vapor changes directly into ice (still H₂O) without a change in its chemical makeup.

* **Chemical Changes:** These changes result in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties.  Neither evaporation nor freezing creates new substances. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:**  While evaporation is caused by heating, ice crystal formation is caused by cooling.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:** This is partially true for ice crystal formation, but not for evaporation.
* **(3) Both are chemical changes:** This is incorrect as both are physical changes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Lady is a horse from this group. Lady has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Lady's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Lady's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Lady's genotype is Ll, meaning she has one dominant allele (L) for black coat and one recessive allele (l) for reddish-brown coat.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). 
* **Phenotype:** Since Lady has at least one dominant allele (L), her phenotype will be determined by the dominant trait, which is a black coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Porter can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Porter can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is the fallacy of judging someone based on the actions or characteristics of their associates, even if those actions are unrelated to the person being judged. In this case, the speaker is trying to discredit Porter based on his uncle's actions, even though there's no evidence that Porter himself is untrustworthy. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **Circular reasoning** involves using the claim itself as evidence. This is not the case here. The speaker is using the uncle's actions as evidence, not Porter's own actions or character.

 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly related to its mass and speed. The formula is KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where KE is kinetic energy, m is mass, and v is speed. 
* **Sample A:** The particles in sample A are more massive and have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. This means they have higher kinetic energy.
* **Temperature:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, sample A has a higher temperature.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 5 hours. The ship that moved 210 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the highest speed."	"The solution is correct! Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Speed is distance over time.**  To figure out which ship was fastest, we need to compare how far each ship traveled in the same amount of time.
* **All ships traveled for 5 hours.**  This makes the comparison easy.
* **Ship (1) traveled the farthest.**  It covered 210 miles, compared to 165 miles for ship (0) and 75 miles for ship (2).

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnetic field, and thus the force between magnets, is directly related to the size of the magnet. Larger magnets have stronger fields.
* **Comparing the Pairs:**  The magnet on the left (Magnet A) is the same size in both pairs.  The magnet on the right (Magnet B) is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. 
* **Smaller Magnet, Weaker Force:** Since Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker than the force in Pair 2. 

The direction of the force (attraction or repulsion) depends on the orientation of the poles, but doesn't impact the magnitude of the force.

648	648	"Question: Based on this information, what is Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pale orange cheeks (1) bright orange cheeks
 Hint: In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
Jack is a cockatiel from this group. Jack has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Jack's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Jack's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks."	"The answer is **(1) bright orange cheeks**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant. This means that if a cockatiel has even one 'R' allele, it will have bright orange cheeks.
* **Jack's Genotype:** Jack's genotype is Rr, meaning he has one dominant 'R' allele and one recessive 'r' allele.
* **Phenotype:** Since the 'R' allele is dominant, Jack will express the bright orange cheeks phenotype even though he also carries the recessive 'r' allele.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Mr. and Mrs. Campbell usually agree. (1) Mr. and Mrs. Campbell are not politically active.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an idiom, an expression that cannot be understood literally.
The idiom see eye to eye suggests that Mr. and Mrs. Campbell usually agree. When you see eye to eye with someone, you share their opinion."	"The correct answer is **(0) Mr. and Mrs. Campbell usually agree.** 

Here's why:

* **The idiom ""see eye to eye"" means to agree or have the same opinion.** 
* The sentence states that they ""usually see eye to eye"" but not on the mayoral race.  This implies they normally share similar viewpoints. 

Choice (1) is incorrect because the text does not suggest they are politically inactive, only that they disagree on this specific issue.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The greedy king kept all the jewels for himself and his sons. (1) Will change out of her wet pants and shirt.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Will change out of her wet pants and shirt is a sentence fragment. It is missing a subject."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**The sentence fragment is: (1) Will change out of her wet pants and shirt.**

Here's why:

* **Sentence Structure:**  A complete sentence needs a subject (who or what is performing the action) and a verb (the action itself).
* **Missing Subject:**  In this case, the sentence lacks a subject. We don't know *who* is going to change out of their wet clothes. 

To make it a complete sentence, we could add a subject like:

burning a candle
melting glass
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But burning a candle is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Burning a candle:**  The flame of a candle is produced by heat. The heat causes the wax to melt and vaporize, allowing it to react with oxygen in a chemical combustion process.
* **Melting glass:** Glass melts when it is heated to a high enough temperature. This is a physical change of state from solid to liquid.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:** This is incorrect because melting glass is a physical change.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:** This is incorrect because burning a candle is a chemical change.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** This is incorrect because both changes involve heating.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**. Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:**  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's directly related to both an object's mass and its speed. The formula is KE = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2.
* **Sample B's Advantage:** Sample B's particles have both higher mass and higher average speed than sample A's particles. This means they have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature:**  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance.  Since sample B has a higher average kinetic energy, it has a higher temperature.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two glasses of orange juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 70°F glass of orange juice is hotter than the 45°F glass of orange juice, it has more thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) a 250-gram glass of orange juice at a temperature of 70°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of an object due to the random motion of its molecules. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those molecules.

The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules are moving, and therefore, the more thermal energy they possess.

678	678	"Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly with distance. The closer the magnets are, the stronger the force.
* **Pair 2 is Closer:**  The magnets in Pair 2 are only 0.9 cm apart, while the magnets in Pair 1 are 2.1 cm apart. 
* **Force and Distance:**  Since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.

The fact that the magnets in Pair 1 repel and the magnets in Pair 2 attract only affects the direction of the force, not its strength.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) DD (1) dark brown seeds
 Hint: In a group of bitter melon plants, some individuals have dark brown seeds and others have light brown seeds. In this group, the gene for the seed color trait has two alleles. The allele D is for dark brown seeds, and the allele d is for light brown seeds.
A certain bitter melon plant from this group has dark brown seeds. This plant has two alleles for dark brown seeds.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The bitter melon plant's observable version of the seed color trait is dark brown seeds. So, the plant's phenotype for the seed color trait is dark brown seeds."	"The correct answer is **(1) dark brown seeds**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype:** This refers to the physical expression of a gene. In this case, the bitter melon plant's physical characteristic is its seed color. 
* **Genotype:** This refers to the actual genetic makeup (alleles) for a trait.  We know the plant has two alleles for dark brown seeds (DD).
* **The connection:** The genotype (DD) determines the phenotype (dark brown seeds).

The question asks specifically for the phenotype, so the answer is the observable trait: **dark brown seeds**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample B**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's directly related to both an object's mass and its velocity (speed).
* **Higher Mass and Speed:** The particles in sample B have a greater mass (32 u) compared to sample A (16 u). They also have a higher average speed (550 m/s) than sample A (520 m/s).
* **Higher Kinetic Energy:** Since both mass and speed contribute to kinetic energy, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  

Therefore, the higher average kinetic energy of particles in sample B means it has a higher temperature.

 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Jennifer baked bread for a bakery. She stored her bread in clear bins in the back of the bakery, but she sometimes found mold growing on the bread. Jennifer wondered if less mold would grow if she stored her bread in dark bins.
Jennifer covered half of the clear bins in dark paper. She left the rest of the bins uncovered. She put an equal amount of bread in each bin. Every day for two weeks, she counted how many loaves of bread in each bin had mold.
Figure: moldy bread.
 Solution: In this experiment, Jennifer investigated whether storing bread in dark bins affects mold growth. So, the loaves of bread in bins covered with dark paper were part of an experimental group.
The loaves of bread in bins with no covering were not stored in dark bins. So, they were not part of an experimental group."	"The answer is **(0) the loaves of bread in bins covered with dark paper**. 

Here's why:

* **Experimental Group:** The experimental group is the group that receives the treatment being tested. In this experiment, the treatment is storing bread in dark bins.
* **Control Group:** The control group does not receive the treatment and serves as a baseline for comparison. In this experiment, the control group is the bread stored in the uncovered bins. 

Jennifer is specifically testing if the darkness of the bins affects mold growth. Therefore, the loaves in the dark bins are the experimental group, while the loaves in the clear bins are the control group.

713	713	"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
When I was in Seattle for a week last January, it didn't rain even once. Seattle's reputation for being rainy is obviously false.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other (2) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that a week without rain is evidence that Seattle isn't a rainy city. However, the experience of one week doesn't necessarily reflect longer trends in a place's climate. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."	"The correct answer is **(2) hasty generalization**. 

Here's why:

* **Hasty generalization:** This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on insufficient evidence or a small sample size. In this case, the speaker is drawing a conclusion about Seattle's overall climate based on a single week's experience, which is not a representative sample. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Guilt by association:** This fallacy involves linking someone or something to a negative group or idea to discredit them. This is not relevant to the text.
* **False causation:** This fallacy assumes that because two things happened together, one caused the other. The text doesn't suggest a cause-and-effect relationship. 

The speaker is making a broad statement about Seattle's climate based on a limited experience, making it a hasty generalization.

 Solution: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun she could refer to Mrs. Newman or her assistant.
Mrs. Newman informed her assistant that she had to book a flight to Seoul immediately.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Mrs. Newman told her assistant to book a flight to Oakdale immediately."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Choice (1) contains a vague pronoun reference.** 

The pronoun ""she"" could refer to either Mrs. Newman or her assistant. This makes the sentence ambiguous and unclear. 

**Choice (0) is correctly written** because it clearly states that the assistant is the one who needs to book the flight.

The school board voted today to adopt a program to teach teens about the dangers of drugs and alcohol. They will not be satisfied until they control every aspect of students' lives.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that drug and alcohol education comes from the school board's desire to control teens' lives. However, the fact that teens are educated about drugs and alcohol doesn't necessarily suggest that the school board wants to control every aspect of their lives. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."	"The correct answer is **(0) straw man**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument misrepresents the school board's position.** The text implies that the school board's sole motivation for drug and alcohol education is control over students' lives. This is a distorted representation of the school board's likely intentions, which could include promoting student safety and well-being.
* **The argument sets up a weaker version of the opponent's position.** By portraying the school board's goal as total control, the argument makes it easier to criticize the program.  It's easier to argue against an extreme position than a more nuanced one.

716	716	"Question: Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the eye color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) brown eyes
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have red eyes and others have brown eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the eye color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the eye color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes."	"The correct answer is **(0) red eyes**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The fly has the genotype Ee, meaning it has one dominant allele (E) for red eyes and one recessive allele (e) for brown eyes.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant. This means that even with one copy of the dominant allele, the fly will express the red eye trait.
* **Phenotype:** The phenotype is the physical expression of the genotype. Since the fly has at least one dominant allele (E), its phenotype will be **red eyes**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a 225-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 12°C (1) a 225-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 20°C (2) a 225-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 7°C
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three glasses of apple juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 20°C glass of apple juice is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(1) a 225-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 20°C**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of a system due to its temperature.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. 

The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving, and therefore the more thermal energy they possess. 

Since all three glasses have the same mass, the one with the highest temperature (20°C) has the most thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Kinetic energy is directly related to temperature. The higher the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, the higher its temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the equation KE = (1/2)mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle

* **Analysis:**  Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,000 m/s). However, the particles in sample B are more massive (30 u) than those in sample A (17 u). Since mass is directly proportional to kinetic energy, the particles in sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy, leading to a higher temperature.

 Hint: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for red flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has red flowers. This plant has one allele for red flowers and one allele for white flowers.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The scarlet rosemallow plant's observable version of the flower color trait is red flowers. So, the plant's phenotype for the flower color trait is red flowers."	"The correct answer is **(0) red flowers**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype:**  This refers to the physical characteristics an organism displays. In this case, the scarlet rosemallow plant has **red flowers**. 
* **Genotype:** This refers to the genetic makeup of an organism. The plant's genotype is Ff, meaning it has one allele for red flowers (F) and one for white flowers (f).

749	749	"Question: What type of rock is shale?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sedimentary (1) igneous (2) metamorphic
 Hint: This is a piece of shale. Shale forms below the ground near lagoons, river deltas, and shallow oceans. It is usually gray.
Layers of mud can be pressed together to form shale. Shale often contains fossils. In this picture, you can see a fossil of a shell on the left side of the rock.
 Solution: Shale is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Material that is eroded in nature is called sediment. Mud is a type of sediment. Over time, layers of mud can build up in places like lakes and oceans. The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Shale forms when the bottom layers of mud are pressed together to form rock."	"The answer is **(0) sedimentary**.

a slice of banana turning brown
cells using oxygen to break down sugar
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
Cells using oxygen to break down sugar is a chemical change. When sugar is broken down, it forms carbon dioxide and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **A slice of banana turning brown** is a chemical change because the chemical composition of the banana changes. The browning is caused by oxidation, where the fruit interacts with oxygen in the air. 
* **Cells using oxygen to break down sugar** is also a chemical change. This process is called cellular respiration.  Sugar (glucose) is broken down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing energy. This is a change in the chemical composition of the sugar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating.**  While heating can speed up chemical reactions, neither of these changes is *caused* by heating.  
* **(1) Both are only physical changes.**  Physical changes involve a change in form or appearance but not a change in the chemical composition. These are chemical changes.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling.**  Cooling doesn't cause either of these changes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's calculated by the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. 
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:**  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **The Data:**  Sample A has heavier particles (44 u) than Sample B (26 u). Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,100 m/s).  
* **Conclusion:** Since Sample A's particles have a greater mass and the same speed as Sample B's particles, they have a higher average kinetic energy. This means Sample A has a higher temperature.

 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele F is for bumpy fruit, and the allele f is for smooth fruit.
A certain cucumber plant from this group has smooth fruit. This plant has two alleles for smooth fruit.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The cucumber plant's observable version of the fruit texture trait is smooth fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait is smooth fruit."	"The correct answer is **(1) smooth fruit**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype:**  This refers to the physical characteristics an organism expresses.
* **Genotype:** This refers to the genetic makeup of an organism. 
* **In this case:** The cucumber plant has smooth fruit, which is its observable trait (phenotype).  The fact that it has two alleles for smooth fruit (ff) is its genotype, but the question asks specifically for the phenotype.

""Sleeping through the rooster's crowing was no problem,"" Jeffrey joked with a yawn.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Jeffrey slept well. (1) Jeffrey slept poorly.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Sleeping through the rooster's crowing was no problem ironically suggests that Jeffrey slept poorly. Jeffrey was tired, so the rooster's crowing was clearly a problem."	"The correct answer is **(1) Jeffrey slept poorly**. 

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** is when someone says something that contradicts their true meaning.  
* In this case, Jeffrey says ""Sleeping through the rooster's crowing was no problem."" However, his yawn and the phrase ""joked"" indicate that this is not true. 
* Roosters typically crow at dawn, and Jeffrey's yawn suggests he didn't sleep well enough to be able to sleep through this noise. 

Therefore, the verbal irony implies that Jeffrey actually slept poorly, even though he jokingly claims otherwise.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 3:1 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the Huntington's disease trait in humans:
Huntington's disease is a condition that causes the death of brain cells over time. This loss of cells interferes with brain function and may lead to uncontrolled movements, difficulty thinking, and changes in behavior.
In a group of humans, some individuals have Huntington's disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Huntington's disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive to the allele for having Huntington's disease (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two humans.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have Huntington's disease, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for not having Huntington's disease, is recessive to the H allele, which is for having Huntington's disease.
Not having Huntington's disease is the recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the recessive version of the Huntington's disease trait must have only recessive alleles for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that do not have Huntington's disease must have the genotype hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
Having Huntington's disease is the dominant allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the dominant version of the Huntington's disease trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that have Huntington's disease must have the genotype HH or Hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype HH or Hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring that do not have Huntington's disease for every 2 offspring that have Huntington's disease."	"The answer is **(0) 2:2**. 

The Punnett square shows that 2 out of 4 offspring will have the genotype 'hh', which means they do not have Huntington's disease. The other 2 offspring will have either 'Hh' or 'HH', meaning they have Huntington's disease. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring without the disease to those with the disease is 2:2.

 Hint: Samir baked two identical cakes. When he took them out of the oven, he left one cake in its pan and took the other cake out of its pan to put it on a plate. This table shows how the temperature of each cake changed over 5minutes.
 Solution: The temperature of each cake decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each cake decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each cake to the surroundings."	"The answer is **(0) each cake . . . the surroundings**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy transfer:** Heat always flows from a warmer object to a cooler object. 
* **Cooling cakes:** The cakes started at 98°C and cooled down, indicating a loss of thermal energy. 
* **Surroundings:**  The air and the plate/pan surrounding the cakes are cooler than the cakes themselves.

774	774	"Question: Which text uses the word terribly in its traditional sense?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Zach shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent. (1) Zach shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Zach shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Zach shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"You are absolutely correct! 

The second text, ""Zach shivered as he gazed at the **terribly** steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent,"" uses ""terribly"" in its traditional sense, meaning ""in a terrible manner."" 

Here's why:

* **Traditional meaning:** ""Terribly"" originally meant ""in a terrible way,"" implying something frightening, dangerous, or unpleasant. 
* **Nontraditional meaning:** Over time, ""terribly"" has been used more colloquially to mean ""extremely"" or ""very."" This is considered less formal and can be confusing, as it doesn't always accurately reflect the intensity of the situation.

In the second text, the steep slope is what makes the situation ""terrible,"" not the shivering itself.

777	777	"Question: Based on this information, what is Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Dasher is a horse from this group. Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Dasher's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Dasher's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dasher's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Dasher's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Dasher has the genotype LL, meaning she has two copies of the dominant ""L"" allele for black coat color.
* **Dominant Allele:** The ""L"" allele is dominant, meaning that even with just one copy, the horse will have a black coat.
* **Phenotype:** The phenotype is the observable trait.  Since Dasher has two dominant ""L"" alleles, her phenotype will be a black coat.

 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1. (1) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(1) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Equal Distances:** Both pairs of magnets have the same distance of 9 mm between them.
* **Same Material:**  The magnets are made of the same material. 

Since the distances and materials are the same, the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair will be equal.

 Hint: Figure: Monongahela National Forest.
The Monongahela National Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in eastern West Virginia.
 Solution: A temperate deciduous forest is a type of ecosystem. Temperate deciduous forests have the following features: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. So, the Monongahela National Forest has soil that is rich in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees."	"The answer is **(1) It has soil that is rich in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees.**

Here's why:

* **Temperate Deciduous Forests:** The Monongahela National Forest is a temperate deciduous forest. These forests are known for their rich soil due to decomposition of leaves and organic matter. They also have a relatively limited number of tree species compared to tropical rainforests.
* **Cold, Wet Winters:** While temperate deciduous forests do experience cold, wet winters, this is not unique to the Monongahela National Forest and isn't the defining characteristic that distinguishes it from other ecosystems.

In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having myotonia congenita, and the allele m is for not having myotonia congenita.
Echo, a goat from this group, does not have myotonia congenita. Echo has two alleles for not having myotonia congenita.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita. So, Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita."	"The correct answer is **(0) not having myotonia congenita**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype:**  A phenotype is the physical expression of a gene.  
* **Echo's Trait:** The passage states that Echo **does not have myotonia congenita**. This is the observable trait, or phenotype.
* **Genotype:** While the passage also mentions Echo's genotype (two alleles for not having myotonia congenita), the question specifically asks for the phenotype.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide contains two symbols: S for sulfur and O for oxygen. So, sulfur dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, sulfur dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for neon contains one symbol: Ne. So, neon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnet's magnetic field depends on its size. Larger magnets have stronger fields.
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:**  In Pair 1, both magnets are relatively large. In Pair 2, one magnet is significantly smaller.
* **Force Relationship:**  Since the smaller magnet in Pair 2 has a weaker magnetic field, the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker than the force between the magnets in Pair 1.

806	806	"Question: In this experiment, which were part of an experimental group?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bottles with lids kept on (1) the bottles with lids taken off
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Steve wanted to freeze soda to make popsicles. He knew that soda contains carbon dioxide gas, which forms bubbles as it escapes from the liquid. He wondered if the popsicles would freeze more quickly if he removed the carbon dioxide.
Steve took the lids off three small bottles of soda. He left the lids off overnight so that carbon dioxide could escape from the bottles. He kept the lids on three other bottles to keep the carbon dioxide in. The next morning, Steve placed all six bottles in the freezer. After two hours, he checked whether soda in any of the bottles had frozen.
Figure: soda with carbon dioxide bubbles.
 Solution: In this experiment, Steve investigated whether removing carbon dioxide from soda affects how quickly the soda freezes. So, the bottles with lids taken off were part of an experimental group.
Carbon dioxide was not removed from the bottles with lids kept on. So, they were not part of an experimental group."	"The answer is **(1) the bottles with lids taken off**. 

Here's why:

* **Experimental Group:**  The experimental group is the one that receives the treatment or change being tested. In this experiment, Steve wanted to see if removing carbon dioxide affected freezing time. 
* **Control Group:** The control group is used for comparison. It does not receive the treatment. The bottles with lids kept on were the control group because they had the standard amount of carbon dioxide. 

Since Steve was testing whether removing carbon dioxide sped up freezing, the bottles where he removed carbon dioxide (lids taken off) are the experimental group.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mushroom (1) snowy owl
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the rough-legged hawk: bear sedge->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk. There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the Arctic fox: bear sedge->brown lemming->Arctic fox. mushroom. The mushroom has two arrows pointing to it. One arrow starts from the barren-ground caribou. The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. The other arrow pointing to the mushroom starts from the grizzly bear. The grizzly bear has two arrows pointing to it. One arrow starts from the bilberry. The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. The other arrow pointing to the grizzly bear starts from the barren-ground caribou. The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the mushroom.. There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the snowy owl: bear sedge->brown lemming->short-tailed weasel->snowy owl. There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the short-tailed weasel: bear sedge->brown lemming->short-tailed weasel."	"The answer is **(1) snowy owl**. Here's why:

* **Food Webs and Matter Flow:** Food webs show how energy and matter move through an ecosystem. Arrows indicate what eats what.  
* **Following the Path:** To find out which organism contains matter from the bear sedge, follow the arrows:
    * Bear sedge -> Brown Lemming -> Short-tailed Weasel -> Snowy Owl 

This path shows that the snowy owl consumes a short-tailed weasel, which in turn consumes a brown lemming, which feeds on bear sedge.  Therefore, matter from the bear sedge is passed on to the snowy owl.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other (1) red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that off-leash dogs would somehow cause an increase in crime in Booneville. However, these two ideas aren't related. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a red herring."	"The correct answer is **(1) red herring**. 

Here's why:

* **Red Herring:**  The argument shifts focus from the issue of off-leash dogs to the unrelated issue of crime. It uses the fear of crime as a distraction to make the original argument seem more compelling, even though there's no logical connection between the two.

Let's break down why the other option isn't correct:

* **False Causation:** This fallacy occurs when someone assumes that because two things happen together, one must have caused the other. There's no indication in the text that the speaker is suggesting a causal relationship between off-leash dogs and crime. 

The speaker is using fear-mongering by suggesting that off-leash dogs will somehow lead to an increase in crime. This is a classic example of a red herring.

water boiling on a stove
baking an apple pie
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water boiling is a physical change. But baking a pie is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking a pie is a chemical change. But water boiling is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Water boiling:**  Water boils when it's heated to its boiling point, causing the liquid water to turn into water vapor (a gas).
* **Baking an apple pie:** Baking involves applying heat to the ingredients, causing chemical reactions to occur. These reactions change the texture, color, and flavor of the ingredients, resulting in a finished pie. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:**  While baking a pie is a chemical change, boiling water is a physical change.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither of these changes is caused by cooling. 
* **(3) Both are only physical changes:**  As explained above, baking a pie is a chemical change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) paradox (1) oxymoron
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a paradox, a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
Nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded at first appears to be contradictory, because if no one goes to the restaurant, then the restaurant should be empty, not crowded. However, it contains some truth: if a restaurant is frequently perceived to be too crowded, many people will no longer want to go there."	"The answer is **(0) paradox**. 

You're absolutely right! The statement ""nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded"" is a classic example of a paradox. It seems contradictory because if no one goes, it shouldn't be crowded.

 Solution: The two mugs of cocoa have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 90°F mug of cocoa is colder than the 95°F mug of cocoa, it has less thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(0) a 250-gram mug of cocoa at a temperature of 90°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.

The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving, and the more thermal energy they have. Since the 90°F mug of cocoa is colder than the 95°F mug, its particles have less average kinetic energy and therefore less thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Arctic fox (1) bilberry
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the bilberry is a producer, not an omnivore.
The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry, which is a producer. The Arctic fox also has an arrow pointing to it from the collared lemming, which is a consumer. The Arctic fox eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore."	The answer is **(0) Arctic fox**.	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 87°F (1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 103°F (2) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 101°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 87°F bowl of oatmeal is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 87°F**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:** Thermal energy is the total energy of the particles within a substance, including their kinetic energy (energy of motion).  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those particles.
* **Higher Temperature = More Thermal Energy:**  The hotter an object is, the faster its particles are moving, and the more thermal energy it has.
* **Same Substance, Different Temperatures:** Since all three bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperature, the one with the lowest temperature (87°F) will have the least thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the surroundings . . . each aquarium (1) each aquarium . . . the surroundings
 Hint: Two identical aquariums were next to an open window. One aquarium had a plastic cover on it, and the other was uncovered. This table shows how the temperature of each aquarium changed over 1.5hours.
 Solution: The temperature of each aquarium decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each aquarium decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each aquarium to the surroundings."	"The answer is **(1) each aquarium . . . the surroundings**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy transfer:** Heat always flows from a warmer object to a cooler object. 
* **Temperature decrease:** The table shows that the temperature of both aquariums decreased over time. This indicates that heat was transferred *out* of the aquariums.
* **Surroundings:**  The open window suggests that the surroundings (the air outside) were likely cooler than the aquariums. 

Therefore, thermal energy was transferred from the aquariums to the cooler surroundings.

840	840	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) fuzzy fruit (1) smooth fruit
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
A certain tomato plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene.
 Solution: The tomato plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is ff. The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for fuzzy fruit. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the tomato plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit."	"The answer is **(0) fuzzy fruit**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype ""ff"", meaning it has two copies of the recessive allele (f) for fuzzy fruit.
* **Dominance:** The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant, while the allele for fuzzy fruit (f) is recessive.
* **Phenotype:** Since the plant only has the recessive alleles, it will express the recessive trait, which is **fuzzy fruit**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.** 

Here's why:

* **Size Matters:** The strength of a magnet's force is related to its size. Larger magnets have a stronger magnetic field.
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:** In Pair 1, the horseshoe magnet is larger than the circular magnet in Pair 2. This means the force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be stronger.
* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** While the direction of the force (attraction or repulsion) depends on the orientation of the poles, it doesn't affect the magnitude of the force itself.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Kraken is a guppy from this group. Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Kraken's genotype for the tail spots gene is II. Kraken's genotype of II has only I allelles. The I allele is for a spotted tail. So, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Kraken's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Kraken's genotype of II has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail."	"The answer is **(0) a spotted tail**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant. This means that if an organism has even one copy of the I allele, it will display the spotted tail trait.
* **Kraken's Genotype:** Kraken has the homozygous genotype II. This means it has two copies of the dominant I allele. 
* **Phenotype:** Since Kraken has two copies of the dominant I allele, its phenotype (the physical expression of the gene) will be a spotted tail.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Distance:** The distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same (3 inches).
* **Shape:** While the magnets have different shapes, the overall size and magnetic strength are the same. 

The magnetic force depends on the strength of the magnets and the distance between them.  Since both of these factors are identical in the two pairs, the magnetic force will be the same.

 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Latrell.
 Hint: Latrell is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Latrell with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Latrell with a force of 400N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Latrell, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Latrell down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Latrell up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:** When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out. This means the overall effect of the forces is zero.
* **Net Force:** Net force is the overall force acting on an object. If forces are balanced, the net force is zero.
* **Latrell's Situation:** The downward force of gravity (400N) is equal and opposite to the upward force from the diving board (400N).  These forces cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 2 has a greater distance between the magnets (2 inches) compared to Pair 1 (1 inch).
* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a box holding 42 pounds (1) a box holding 39 pounds
 Hint: Two movers are putting heavy boxes into their truck. The boxes are the same shape and size. Each mover lifts one box up into the truck at a time.
 Solution: Look for the box that is heavier.
A box holding 42 pounds is heavier than a box holding 39 pounds. So, the box holding 42 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other box."	"The answer is **(0) a box holding 42 pounds**. 

Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  Force is needed to overcome the weight of an object. The heavier an object, the more force is required to move it.
* **Constant Speed:**  Even though the movers lift at the same speed, the heavier box requires more force to achieve that speed.  

Think of it this way: If you push a small car and a large truck with the same effort, the car will accelerate faster because it has less weight to overcome.

 Solution: The source of the allusion spartan is Greek history.
Soldiers from the city of Sparta in ancient Greece were known for their self-restraint, self-discipline, and indifference to luxury.
The allusion spartan means simple and austere."	"The correct answer is **(1) Greek history**. 

Here's why:

* **Spartan** refers to the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta, known for its warrior culture and austere lifestyle. 
* Spartans were famous for their discipline, self-reliance, and lack of indulgence in luxury. They valued simplicity and strength above all else.

 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	The answer is (2).	natural science
879	879	"Question: Select the solid.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) air inside a beach ball (1) chocolate syrup (2) apple juice (3) thread
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Apple juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour apple juice into a different container, the apple juice will take the shape of that container. But the apple juice will still take up the same amount of space.
The air inside a beach ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air fills all the space inside the beach ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.
Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.
Thread is a solid that can be bent or tangled. But it still has a size and shape of its own."	"The correct answer is **(3) thread**. Here's why:

* **Solids** have a definite shape and volume. They don't easily change shape like liquids or gases. 
* **Liquids** take the shape of their container.
* **Gases** fill the entire space they occupy.

Thread maintains its shape and volume, making it a solid.

886	886	"Question: Based on this information, what is Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having agouti fur (1) having agouti fur
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A).
Salem is a cat from this group. Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene.
 Solution: Salem's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa. Salem's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for not having agouti fur. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Salem's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Salem's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur."	"The correct answer is **(0) not having agouti fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The passage states that the allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive. 
* **Homozygous Recessive:** Salem has the genotype ""aa,"" meaning he has two copies of the recessive allele.
* **Phenotype Expression:**  When an organism has two copies of the recessive allele, the recessive trait is expressed. Therefore, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait is **not having agouti fur**.

 Hint: In a group of ornamental gourd plants, some individuals have yellow fruit and others have green fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f).
A certain ornamental gourd plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit color gene.
 Solution: The ornamental gourd plant's genotype for the fruit color gene is ff. The ornamental gourd plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for green fruit. So, the ornamental gourd plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the ornamental gourd plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The ornamental gourd plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the ornamental gourd plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit."	"The answer is **(0) green fruit**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype **ff**, meaning it has two recessive alleles for fruit color.
* **Recessive Allele:**  The 'f' allele is recessive, meaning it only expresses its trait (green fruit) when paired with another 'f' allele.

 Hint: Gavin is deciding whether to get vanilla fudge ripple ice cream or sweet cream ice cream. He likes vanilla fudge ripple more than sweet cream. But a scoop of sweet cream ice cream comes with a free waffle cone.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Gavin wants or needs:
Gavin will give up the chance to get a free waffle cone. He would have enjoyed the waffle cone."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why the correct answer is **(0) Gavin will give up the chance to get a free waffle cone. He would have enjoyed the waffle cone.**

* **Cost:**  A cost in economics represents something you give up or forgo when making a choice.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** In this case, the cost of choosing vanilla fudge ripple is the opportunity to get a free waffle cone, which Gavin would have enjoyed. He's trading one good for another.

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **(1) Gavin will get to eat the vanilla fudge ripple ice cream. He likes this flavor more than sweet cream.** This is a benefit, not a cost.  Gavin gets something he enjoys. 

The key takeaway is that costs are about what you sacrifice when making a choice.

My dog, Scooter, is the security guard for our front yard mailbox.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metaphor (1) simile
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: My dog, Scooter, is the security guard for our front yard mailbox.
The words Scooter and security guard are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"The answer is **(0) metaphor**. 

Here's why:

* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly compares two unlike things without using ""like"" or ""as"". In this case, Scooter (a dog) is being compared to a security guard.
* **Simile:** A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two unlike things. 

Since the sentence states ""Scooter is the security guard,"" it's a direct comparison, making it a metaphor.

 Solution: A bighorn sheep's scientific name is Ovis canadensis. The first word of its scientific name is Ovis.
Castor canadensis and Ovis canadensis are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Castor canadensis and Ovis canadensis have the same species name within their genus, canadensis. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Castor canadensis is in the genus Castor, and Ovis canadensis is in the genus Ovis.
Strix nebulosa is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix nebulosa and Ovis canadensis are not in the same genus.
Ovis aries is in the genus Ovis. The first word of its scientific name is Ovis. So, Ovis aries and Ovis canadensis are in the same genus."	"The answer is (0). 

The scientific name for the bighorn sheep is *Ovis canadensis*.  The genus is *Ovis*, so the other organism in the same genus is *Ovis aries*.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has a small amount of rain or snow. (1) It has only a few types of trees.
 Hint: Figure: Białowieża Forest.
The Białowieża Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem located in Poland and Belarus. It is one of the largest and oldest forests in Europe.
 Solution: A temperate deciduous forest is a type of ecosystem. Temperate deciduous forests have the following features: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. So, the following statements describe the Białowieża Forest ecosystem: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. It has only a few types of trees. It has warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters. The following statement does not describe the Białowieża Forest: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. It has a small amount of rain or snow."	"The correct answer is **(1) It has only a few types of trees.**

Here's why:

* **Temperate deciduous forests** are known for having a relatively limited number of dominant tree species. This is in contrast to rainforests, for example, which have a much greater diversity of trees. 

Let's examine the other options:

* **(0) It has a small amount of rain or snow.** This is incorrect. Temperate deciduous forests are characterized by having a significant amount of precipitation, both as rain and snow. 

The image you provided of the Białowieża Forest further supports the idea that it has only a few types of trees. The trees appear to be mostly uniform in size and shape, which is typical for temperate deciduous forests.

A trichina worm has the following traits:
A trichina worm has the traits of a roundworm. A trichina worm is a roundworm.
A birdwing butterfly has the following traits:
It has six legs.
It has an exoskeleton.
It has one pair of antennae.
A birdwing butterfly does not have all of the traits of a roundworm. A birdwing butterfly is an insect."	"The correct answer is **(1) Trichina worms**. 

Here's why:

* **Roundworm Traits:** Soft, cylindrical body, no limbs, not segmented.
* **Trichina Worm Traits:** Matches all of the roundworm traits.
* **Birdwing Butterfly Traits:**  Has an exoskeleton, six legs, and antennae. These are insect traits, not roundworm traits.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) oxymoron (1) apostrophe
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Open secret is a contradiction, because open describes something that is freely or publicly known, and a secret is hidden."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(0) oxymoron**. 

The phrase ""open secret"" is a classic example of an oxymoron because it combines two words with opposing meanings.  

Let's break it down:

* **Open:**  Meaning something is publicly known or easily accessible.
* **Secret:** Meaning something is hidden or concealed. 

By putting these two words together, the author creates a sense of irony and emphasizes the peculiar situation where everyone knows about Emilio's book, even though he doesn't openly discuss it.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Earth is pulling on the Sun. (1) Earth is pushing on the Sun.
 Hint: Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
The Sun is pulling on Earth.
 Solution: The Sun is pulling on Earth. So, Newton's third law tells you that Earth is pulling on the Sun."	"The correct answer is **(1) Earth is pushing on the Sun.**

Here's why:

* **Newton's Third Law:**  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always come in pairs.
* **The Scenario:** The Sun exerts a gravitational force on Earth, pulling it towards itself. This is the ""action"".
* **The Reaction:**  According to Newton's Third Law, Earth must exert an equal and opposite force on the Sun.  Since the Sun is pulling on Earth, Earth must be pulling back on the Sun.  

**Important Note:** While the force Earth exerts on the Sun is equal in magnitude to the Sun's force on Earth, it doesn't have the same effect. The Sun is much more massive, so Earth's pull on the Sun causes a much smaller acceleration.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: This organism is photosynthetic:
The text tells you that bearberry plants use energy from sunlight to make food. This is evidence that the bearberry plant is a photosynthetic organism.
This organism is not photosynthetic:
The text does not provide evidence that the polar bear is photosynthetic."	"The correct answer is **(1) Bearberry plants are plants found in the Arctic. Bearberry plants use energy from sunlight to make food.**

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis:** The text explicitly states that bearberry plants use energy from sunlight to make food. This is the defining characteristic of photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy (food). 
* **Polar Bears:** The text describes polar bears as meat-eating animals, which means they get their energy from consuming other organisms. This is not indicative of photosynthesis. 

Therefore, the bearberry plant is the photosynthetic organism in this scenario.

933	933	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 1:3 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have thorns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. The question tells you that the R allele, which is for having thorns, is dominant over the r allele, which is for not having thorns.
Having thorns is the dominant allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the thorns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the thorns gene. So, offspring that have thorns must have the genotype RR or Rr.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr.
Not having thorns is the recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the thorns trait must have only recessive alleles for the thorns gene. So, offspring that do not have thorns must have the genotype rr.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype rr.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have thorns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have thorns."	"The answer is **(2) 0:4**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant vs. Recessive:** The allele for thorns (R) is dominant, meaning even one 'R' will result in a thorny plant. The allele for no thorns (r) is recessive, so only two 'r' alleles will produce a thornless plant.

* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all offspring will have the genotype 'rr', which is the recessive combination. This means *all* offspring will inherit the trait for no thorns.

* **Ratio:**  The ratio of thorny to thornless offspring is 0:4,  meaning there will be no thorny offspring and all offspring will be thornless.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations (2) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that a single polite British person indicates that all British people are nice. However, this isn't necessarily true. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."	"The correct answer is **(1) hasty generalization**. 

Here's why:

* **Hasty generalization:** This fallacy occurs when a conclusion is drawn based on a small or unrepresentative sample. In this case, the speaker is judging all British people based on the kindness of a single individual they encountered. 

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

* **Guilt by association:** This fallacy involves associating someone or something with a negative group or characteristic to discredit them. This doesn't apply to the text, as the speaker is associating British people with a positive trait. 
* **Appeal to nature:** This fallacy argues that something is good or desirable because it's natural. The text doesn't make any claims about the natural world. 

The text exemplifies a hasty generalization because it jumps to a broad conclusion about an entire group of people based on a single, limited observation.

A stone statue is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. Stone statues are made of one or more pieces of rock. Each piece of rock has a size and shape of its own.
An umbrella is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you open an umbrella, it still has a size and shape of its own.
A baseball cap is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. If you put a baseball cap on your head, the baseball cap will still have a size and shape of its own."	"The answer is **(2) caramel sauce**. 

Here's why:

* **Liquids** take the shape of their container. Caramel sauce flows and conforms to whatever it's in.
* **Solids** maintain their shape. Umbrellas, baseball caps, and stone statues all keep their original form.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has a small amount of rain. It also has dry, thin soil. (1) It has a small amount of rain. It also has soil that is frozen year-round.
 Hint: Figure: Sonoran Desert.
The Sonoran Desert is a hot desert ecosystem in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico.
 Solution: A hot desert is a type of ecosystem. Hot deserts have the following features: a small amount of rain, dry, thin soil, and many different types of organisms. So, the Sonoran Desert has a small amount of rain. It also has dry, thin soil."	"The answer is **(0) It has a small amount of rain. It also has dry, thin soil.** 

Here's why:

* **Deserts are characterized by low rainfall and dry soil.**  The Sonoran Desert, being a hot desert, fits this description.
* **Frozen soil is typical of cold climates, not hot deserts.** This makes choice (1) incorrect. 

The Sonoran Desert, while known for its heat, also experiences a unique phenomenon: summer monsoon rains. These rains, while infrequent, are crucial for the ecosystem.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) Solution A (2) neither; their concentrations are the same
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles."	"The answer is **(0) Solution B**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration:** Concentration refers to the amount of solute (the green particles) dissolved in a given volume of solvent.
* **Solution A:**  Has 10 green particles in 35 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B:**  Has 15 green particles in 35 mL of solvent. 

Since Solution B has more green particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

Your elderly grandmother wants a dog for companionship, yet you don't want to get her one. Why do you want your grandmother to be sad and lonely?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that you don't want your grandmother to have a dog, because you want her to be lonely. However, the fact that you don't want her to have a dog doesn't necessarily suggest that you want her to be lonely. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."	"The answer is **(0) straw man**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument twists your reasoning.**  The text assumes that your reason for not wanting a dog for your grandmother is because you want her to be lonely. This is a misrepresentation of your position and sets up a weaker argument to attack.
* **It ignores other possible reasons.** There could be many reasons why you wouldn't want a dog for your grandmother: allergies, financial concerns, concerns about her ability to care for a pet, etc. The argument simply ignores these possibilities.

**In essence, the argument creates a ""straw man"" version of your position and then attacks that straw man, making it seem like you are advocating for your grandmother's loneliness, which isn't actually the case.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) shiny (1) hard (2) sour
 Hint: Select the best answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
A lemon has a sour taste. The wet ice cube is not sour.
A shiny object reflects a lot of light. You can usually see your reflection in a shiny object. The marbles are shiny, but the horseshoe is not.
A hard object does not change shape when pressed or squeezed. All four objects are hard.
The property that all four objects have in common is hard."	"The answer is (1).  Here's why:

* **Shiny (0):**  While some of the objects are shiny (the marbles), others are not (the horseshoe, the slide, and the ice cube).
* **Hard (1):** All four objects are solid and resist deformation when pressed or squeezed.
* **Sour (2):** Only the lemon (which is not shown in the image) has a sour taste. 

Therefore, the common property of all four objects is being **hard**.

Since toil is between the guide words tax - trot, it would be found on that page."	"The answer is **(1) yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Alphabetical Order:**  ""Toil"" comes alphabetically after ""tax"" and before ""trot"". 
* **Guide Words:** Guide words indicate the first and last words on a dictionary page. 
* **Location:** Since ""toil"" falls between the guide words ""tax"" and ""trot"", it would be found on that page.

947	947	"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I can't believe you'd hire Jake Perry to watch your dog! Did you know that his friend adopted a dog but then took it back to the shelter after just one week?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Jake must be an irresponsible dog owner, because his friend was an irresponsible dog owner. However, even though Jake's friend was irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Jake is also irresponsible. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is a fallacy where someone is judged based on the actions or characteristics of their associates, even if there's no direct evidence linking them to those actions. 

In this case, the text argues that Jake Perry is a bad dog owner because his friend returned a dog to the shelter. There's no evidence provided to support this claim about Jake himself.  

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **Hasty generalization**  involves drawing a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. While the text does have a limited amount of evidence (one friend's action), it's not a hasty generalization because it's not making a broad claim about all of Jake's potential traits.

In the Republican primary, the senator labeled his opponent a snake oil salesman.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a poem (1) U.S. history
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion snake oil salesman is U.S. history.
Thousands of Chinese laborers immigrated to the United States in the 1800 s. Many of them brought traditional medicines, including snake oil made from the Chinese water snake. In time, some people made fake versions of the remedy, and when the fakes were eventually exposed as ineffective, the salesmen gained a poor reputation.
The allusion snake oil salesman means a person making false promises."	"The answer is **(1) U.S. history**. 

Here's why:

* **Snake oil salesmen** were a real phenomenon in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. They would peddle ""snake oil"" as a cure-all for various ailments, often making extravagant claims that were not backed by scientific evidence. 
* The term ""snake oil salesman"" became synonymous with a charlatan or someone who uses deceptive tactics to sell something worthless.

The allusion is drawing on this historical context to suggest that the senator's opponent is making false promises or engaging in deceptive practices.

951	951	"Question: Select the solid.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pair of scissors (1) water in a glass (2) grape juice (3) air from a hair dryer
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.
A pair of scissors is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you use a pair of scissors to cut paper, the pair of scissors still has a size and shape of its own.
The water in a glass is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour water from a glass into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.
Grape juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour grape juice into a different container, the grape juice will take the shape of that container. But the grape juice will still take up the same amount of space."	"The correct answer is **(0) pair of scissors**. 

Here's why:

* **Solids** have a fixed shape and volume. They don't change their shape easily. A pair of scissors maintains its shape regardless of where it's placed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Water in a glass** and **(2) Grape juice** are liquids. Liquids take the shape of their container. 
* **(3) Air from a hair dryer** is a gas. Gases expand to fill their container.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. (1) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1. (2) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly as the distance between magnets increases. 
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a distance of 2 inches between the magnets, while Pair 2 has a distance of 1 inch. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

 Choices: (0) Samuel will give up the chance to go to South Carolina. He would have enjoyed a trip to South Carolina more than California. (1) Samuel will save some money. Plane tickets for Samuel to get to California are less expensive than tickets to South Carolina.
 Hint: Samuel is deciding whether to take a trip to South Carolina or California. He wants to enjoy his trip. But he is also trying to save money.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Samuel wants or needs:
Samuel will give up the chance to go to South Carolina. He would have enjoyed a trip to South Carolina more than California."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Opportunity Cost:**  The concept of ""cost"" in economics isn't just about money. It's also about what you give up when you choose one option over another. This is called opportunity cost.

* **Samuel's Dilemma:** Samuel wants to enjoy his trip *and* save money. He's facing a trade-off. By choosing California, he's giving up the chance to go to South Carolina, which he would have enjoyed more. This enjoyment he's giving up is the cost of going to California.

 Hint: Stacy is deciding whether to see the meerkats or the monkeys at the zoo. She wants to see lots of animals, but the zoo is closing soon.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Stacy wants or needs:
Stacy will spend more time walking to the meerkats. They are on the other side of the zoo, but the monkeys are close by."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Cost** in economics refers to the opportunity cost of a decision. It's the value of the best alternative you give up when making a choice. 
* **Option (1)** highlights this perfectly. Stacy is choosing to see the meerkats, which means she's giving up the opportunity to spend that time seeing the monkeys, which are closer. This is the cost of her decision.

Let's break down why the other option isn't a cost:

* **Option (0)**  is about the **benefit** of seeing the meerkats. It's a positive outcome, not a cost. 

**In short, choosing to see the meerkats comes at the cost of spending more time walking and missing out on seeing the monkeys.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The Costa Rican hairy caterpillar wards off predators with its poisonous spines. (1) If you thought that dish was spicy, this dish will set your mouth on fire.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is the simple sentence. It is a single independent clause.
The Costa Rican hairy caterpillar wards off predators with its poisonous spines."	"You are absolutely right! Here's why:

* **Simple Sentence:** A simple sentence contains one independent clause. An independent clause is a group of words that expresses a complete thought and can stand alone. 

* **Choice (0):**  ""The Costa Rican hairy caterpillar wards off predators with its poisonous spines."" This is a simple sentence because it has one independent clause.

* **Choice (1):** ""If you thought that dish was spicy, this dish will set your mouth on fire."" This is a complex sentence because it has two clauses: 
    * **Independent clause:** ""This dish will set your mouth on fire.""
    * **Dependent clause:** ""If you thought that dish was spicy.""  The word ""if"" makes this clause dependent on the main clause.

**Therefore, the correct answer is (0).**

My dog, Rusty, is the security guard for our front yard mailbox.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) simile (1) metaphor
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: My dog, Rusty, is the security guard for our front yard mailbox.
The words Rusty and security guard are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"The answer is **(1) metaphor**. 

Here's why:

* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly compares two things without using ""like"" or ""as"". In this sentence, Rusty is being directly compared to a security guard. 
* **Simile:** A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" to make a comparison.  

Since the sentence says Rusty *is* the security guard, not that he's *like* a security guard, it's a metaphor.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gray whale that moved 50miles in 10hours (1) a gray whale that moved 20miles in 10hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each gray whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One gray whale moved 50 miles in 10 hours.
The other gray whale moved 20 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each gray whale spent the same amount of time moving. The gray whale that moved 50 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that gray whale must have moved at a higher speed."	"The correct answer is **(0)**. Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time.** 
* **Whale 1:**  50 miles / 10 hours = 5 miles per hour
* **Whale 2:** 20 miles / 10 hours = 2 miles per hour

Whale 1 traveled at a higher speed because it covered a greater distance in the same amount of time.

 Solution: Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Native gold is a mineral.
Muscovite is a mineral.
A sunflower seed is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
A sunflower seed is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, a sunflower seed is not a mineral."	"The correct answer is **(1) A sunflower seed is not a pure substance. It is made by a living thing.**

Here's why:

* **Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a specific chemical composition and a crystalline structure.** 
* **Sunflower seeds are organic**, meaning they are derived from living organisms. They are not formed through inorganic processes.

Let's analyze the other options:

* **(0) Native gold is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.**  Gold is a naturally occurring element and fits the definition of a mineral.
* **(2) Muscovite is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.** Muscovite is a common mineral, often found in metamorphic rocks. 

Therefore, the only choice that does not meet the criteria of a mineral is the sunflower seed.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing Pairs:**  Pair 1 has a larger distance between the magnets (21.1 mm) compared to Pair 2 (9.3 mm).
* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

 Hint: Josiah is deciding whether to see the emus or the crocodiles at the zoo. He wants to see lots of animals, but the zoo is closing soon.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Josiah wants or needs:
Josiah will give up the chance to see the emus. He would have enjoyed seeing them more than the crocodiles."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Cost in Economics:** A cost represents something that is given up or sacrificed when making a choice. It doesn't necessarily have to be money.
* **Josiah's Dilemma:**  Josiah has limited time at the zoo. Choosing to see the crocodiles means he can't see the emus, which he would have enjoyed more. This is a cost – he's giving up the opportunity to see the emus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a black body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a black body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a gray body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a black body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A black body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a black body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a black body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a gray body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a black body."	"The correct answer is **(0) 4:0**. 

The Punnett square shows that all offspring will have at least one ""B"" allele, resulting in a gray body. There are no offspring with the ""bb"" genotype, which would result in a black body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 0:4 (2) 2:2 (3) 3:1 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the G allele, which is for climbing growth, is dominant over the g allele, which is for bush growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth."	"The answer is **(2) 2:2**. 

The Punnett square shows that there are two boxes with the genotype GG or Gg (climbing growth) and two boxes with the genotype gg (bush growth). This means the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2.

Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's directly related to both mass and speed: KE = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2
* **Higher Average Kinetic Energy:** The particles in Sample A have higher mass (28 u vs. 20 u) and higher average speed (660 m/s vs. 500 m/s). This means they have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature:**  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, it must have a higher temperature.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each blue jay moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One blue jay moved 180 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other blue jay moved 190 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each blue jay spent the same amount of time moving. The blue jay that moved 180 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that blue jay must have moved at a lower speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) a blue jay that moved 180 kilometers in 5 hours**.

Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time.**  
* Both blue jays traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours).
* The blue jay that traveled 180 kilometers covered a shorter distance than the blue jay that traveled 190 kilometers. 
* Since they traveled for the same time, the blue jay that covered less distance must have been moving at a slower speed.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for cyclopropane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, cyclopropane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, cyclopropane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for phosphine contains two symbols: P for phosphorus and H for hydrogen. So, phosphine is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, phosphine is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for argon contains one symbol: Ar. So, argon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, argon is an elementary substance."	"The correct answer is **(1) argon (Ar)**. 

Here's why:

* **Elementary substances** are made up of only one type of atom.
* **Compounds** are formed when two or more different types of atoms bond together.

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) cyclopropane (C3H6):** This contains carbon (C) and hydrogen (H) atoms, making it a compound.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the metal paper clip with less thermal energy (1) the metal paper clip with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two metal paper clips are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two metal paper clips are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the metal paper clip with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."	"The answer is **(0) the metal paper clip with less thermal energy**. 

Here's why:

* **Temperature and Thermal Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within an object. Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of all the particles within an object.
* **Relationship:**  A higher temperature means the particles are moving faster and have higher kinetic energy. Therefore, more thermal energy corresponds to a higher temperature. 

Since the paper clips are identical in material and mass, the one with less thermal energy will have a lower average kinetic energy and thus a lower temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a friend who weighs 32 pounds (1) a friend who weighs 31 pounds
 Hint: Ruben gives two friends a ride in his wagon. One friend sits in the wagon at a time.
 Solution: Look for the friend who is heavier.
A friend who weighs 32 pounds is heavier than a friend who weighs 31 pounds. So, to move the wagon at the same speed each time, Ruben needs to use a larger force to start moving the wagon with a friend who weighs 32 pounds."	"The solution is correct and well-explained. Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Force and Mass:**  The amount of force needed to move an object is directly related to the object's mass (how much it weighs).  The heavier the object, the more force is required to get it moving. 
* **Wagon and Friends:**  The wagon itself has a certain mass. Adding a heavier friend increases the total mass of the wagon and friend system.  
* **Constant Speed:** To maintain the same speed, Ruben needs to exert the same amount of force to overcome the increased resistance of the heavier friend.

**Therefore, the correct answer is (0) a friend who weighs 32 pounds.**

a penny tarnishing
a piece of apple turning brown
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Tarnishing:**  When a penny tarnishes, a chemical reaction occurs between the copper in the penny and substances in the air (like oxygen and sulfur). This forms a new substance, copper oxide or copper sulfide, which is what causes the dull, greenish appearance.
* **Apple Turning Brown:** When an apple is cut open, it's exposed to oxygen. The oxygen reacts with enzymes in the apple, causing a chemical reaction that produces brown pigments. 

**Key takeaway:** Chemical changes result in the formation of new substances with different properties than the original substances. Both tarnishing and apple browning involve the creation of new substances.

 Hint: Hint: Some humans are born with naturally straight hair. Others are born with naturally curly hair.
 Solution: Human hair can be naturally straight or naturally curly. Straight and curly are examples of hair texture.
Some people use tools to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally straight hair is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(1) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Hair texture (straight, curly, wavy) is determined by genes.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or personal choices.  While people can style their hair to appear straight, this doesn't change the natural texture determined by their genes.

1031	1031	"Question: Based on this information, what is Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white spots (1) solid coloring
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Ace is a cow from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."	"The correct answer is **(1) solid coloring**. 

Here's why:

* **Heterozygous:** Ace's genotype ""Aa"" means he has one dominant allele (A) and one recessive allele (a).
* **Dominant allele:** The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means that even with one copy of the dominant allele, the dominant trait will be expressed.

Therefore, since Ace has at least one ""A"" allele, his phenotype (observable trait) will be **solid coloring**.

The metaphor Tanvi felt a roller coaster of emotions suggests that Tanvi had varied feelings. A roller coaster has a dramatic mix of ups and downs, and so do Tanvi's feelings."	"The correct answer is **(1) Tanvi had varied feelings.** 

Here's why:

* **Metaphor:** The sentence uses a metaphor, comparing Tanvi's feelings to a roller coaster. This comparison is implied, not directly stated using ""like"" or ""as.""
* **Roller Coaster:** A roller coaster is known for its ups and downs, sudden changes in direction, and intense highs and lows.
* **Varied Feelings:**  The metaphor suggests that Tanvi's emotions are similarly fluctuating and diverse, just like the experience of riding a roller coaster. 

The answer choice (0) ""Tanvi felt delighted about the news"" is incorrect because it only focuses on one emotion, while the metaphor implies a range of emotions.

1035	1035	"Question: Based on this information, what is Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white spots (1) solid coloring
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).
Chuck is a cow from this group. Chuck has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Chuck's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Chuck's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."	"The correct answer is **(1) solid coloring**. 

Here's why:

* **Chuck's genotype is Aa:** This means he has one dominant allele (A) for solid coloring and one recessive allele (a) for white spots.
* **Dominant alleles determine phenotype:** Since the allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant, it will express itself even in the presence of the recessive allele (a). 

Therefore, even though Chuck carries the recessive allele for white spots, his phenotype will be solid coloring.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) black eyes
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E).
Gilligan is a koi fish from this group. Gilligan has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene.
 Solution: Gilligan's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. Gilligan's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for black eyes. So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether Gilligan's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Gilligan's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes."	"The correct answer is **(1) black eyes**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Alleles:**  Gilligan has the homozygous genotype 'ee', meaning he has two copies of the recessive allele 'e' for black eyes.
* **Phenotype:** A recessive allele only expresses its trait when an organism has two copies of it. Since Gilligan has two 'e' alleles, his phenotype will be black eyes.

 Solution: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun them is used without its antecedent.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. Them has been replaced with city officials.
The neighborhood association wants city officials to provide more affordable housing."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Choice (0) ""The neighborhood association wants them to provide more affordable housing""** contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun ""them"" is unclear. Who is ""them""? 

**Choice (1) ""The neighborhood association wants city officials to provide more affordable housing""** corrects the vague pronoun by specifying the intended antecedent as ""city officials"".

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 5 hours. The bicycle that moved 135 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the highest speed."	"The correct answer is **(2) a bicycle that moved 135 kilometers north in 5 hours**. 

Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time.** 
* All three bicycles traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours).
* The bicycle that traveled 135 kilometers covered the greatest distance in that time, meaning it had the highest speed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Boxer is a cow from this group. Boxer has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Boxer's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Boxer's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Boxer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Boxer's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Boxer's genotype is LL, meaning he has two dominant ""L"" alleles for black coat color.
* **Dominant Allele:** The ""L"" allele for black coat is dominant over the ""l"" allele for red coat.
* **Phenotype:**  Since Boxer has at least one dominant ""L"" allele, his phenotype (physical appearance) will be a black coat.

Ernest's Falstaffian nature makes him stand out at a party.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Greek mythology (1) Shakespeare
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Falstaffian is Shakespeare.
Sir John Falstaff, a comical character in several of William Shakespeare's plays, is known for his cheerful sociability and sometimes off-color humor.
The allusion Falstaffian means characterized by joviality and enjoyment of food and drink."	"The answer is **(1) Shakespeare**. 

Here's why:

* **Falstaffian** is an allusion, meaning it references a well-known person, place, or event from literature or history.
* **Sir John Falstaff** is a fictional character created by William Shakespeare. He appears in several of Shakespeare's plays, most notably *Henry IV, Part 1*, *Henry IV, Part 2*, and *The Merry Wives of Windsor*.
* Falstaff is known for his boisterous, jovial, and often self-indulgent nature. 

Therefore, the sentence ""Ernest's Falstaffian nature makes him stand out at a party"" is using the allusion to suggest Ernest has a similar personality to Falstaff, characterized by his enjoyment of company and perhaps a love of good food and drink.

 Solution: This poem has a regular rhythm, or a pattern of sound like a beat. The parts in bold show the strong syllables. The pattern is a weak syllable followed by a strong syllable. It sounds like da-DUM da-DUM.
As if to hide from view."	"The correct answer is **(1) Within a green and shady bed
A modest violet grew;
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head,
As if to hide from view.**

Here's why:

* **Rhythm:** The poem uses a consistent iambic tetrameter rhythm.  This means each line has four metrical feet, with each foot consisting of an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable (da-DUM).  You can hear this pattern in the lines provided:
    * **Within** a green and sha**dy** bed
    * A **mod**est vi**o**let grew;
    * Its **stalk** was bent, it **hung** its head,
    * As **if** to hide from **view**. 
* **Choice (0):** This excerpt from Richard Aldington's ""Childhood"" does not follow the same rhythmic pattern.  It's more irregular and lacks the consistent da-DUM beat.

dust settling out of the air
melting wax
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Dust settling out of the air:** This is a physical change because the dust particles are simply rearranging themselves, not changing their chemical composition.
* **Melting wax:** This is also a physical change. The wax is changing state from solid to liquid, but it's still the same chemical substance. 

Let's eliminate the other choices:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While melting wax is caused by heating, dust settling is caused by gravity.
* **(1) Both are chemical changes:**  Neither change involves the formation of new substances.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is directly caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) He won't get lost, I will give him directions. (1) Goes on a big adventure.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: He won't get lost, I will give him directions is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined by just a comma: He won't get lost and I will give him directions."	"You are absolutely correct! 

The sentence **(0) He won't get lost, I will give him directions.** is a run-on sentence.

* **Run-on sentences** occur when two or more independent clauses (complete sentences) are joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions.
* In this case, ""He won't get lost"" and ""I will give him directions"" are both complete sentences. 
* They are only separated by a comma, which is not sufficient to join them correctly.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Candice's claim that the Loch Ness Monster isn't real is not valid because she's not Scottish. This is a personal attack on Candice's background that isn't relevant to whether her claim is valid. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."	"The correct answer is **(2) ad hominem**. 

Here's why:

* **Ad hominem** attacks the person making the argument instead of addressing the argument itself. In this case, the argument focuses on Candice's nationality rather than the evidence for or against the Loch Ness Monster. 

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **Straw man:**  A straw man fallacy misrepresents the opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. This isn't happening here; the opponent's argument is directly addressed, just in an invalid way.
* **False dichotomy:** This fallacy presents only two options when more exist. This isn't present in the text, as there isn't a limited set of options being presented. 

**In summary:** The argument dismisses Candice's claim based on her nationality, making it an ad hominem attack.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the meatball with less thermal energy (1) the meatball with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two meatballs are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two meatballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the meatball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) the meatball with more thermal energy**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy:** This is the total internal energy of a system due to the motion of its atoms and molecules.
* **Temperature:** This is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.

If two objects are made of the same material and have the same mass, the one with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature. This is because the particles in the object with more thermal energy are moving faster on average.

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.
Oliver, a cat from this group, does not have agouti fur. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur (a). So, Oliver's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa."	"The correct answer is **(1) aa**. 

Here's why:

* **The information tells us:** Oliver does not have agouti fur, and he has two alleles for not having agouti fur.
* **The alleles are:** A (agouti fur) and a (no agouti fur).
* **Since Oliver doesn't have agouti fur, he must have two ""a"" alleles.**  This is because the ""a"" allele is recessive, meaning it only shows up in the phenotype (physical trait) if two copies are present.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 4:0 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a dwarf body or a normal-sized body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a dwarf body.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to offspring with a normal-sized body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a dwarf body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a normal-sized body."	"The answer is **(3) 0:4**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant and Recessive Alleles:** The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant, meaning that even if a rat inherits one B allele and one b allele, it will have a normal-sized body. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive, meaning that a rat must inherit two b alleles to have a dwarf body.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes (Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb) contain at least one B allele. This means all offspring will have a normal-sized body.
* **Ratio:** The ratio of dwarf body to normal-sized body offspring is 0:4, because no offspring will have the recessive bb genotype.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) teddy bear (1) Mount Rushmore National Memorial (2) snowy owl (3) book
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: A teddy bear is not a living thing.
Teddy bears do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow or respond to their environment. They do not need food or water.
A book is not a living thing.
Books do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow or respond to their environment. They do not need food or water.
Mount Rushmore National Memorial is not a living thing.
The Mount Rushmore National Memorial is a sculpture of four American presidents: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The sculpture does not have all the traits of a living thing. It does not grow or respond to the world around it. It does not need food or water.
A snowy owl is a living thing.
Snowy owls grow and respond to their environment. They need food and water. Snowy owls are made up of many cells."	"The answer is **(2) snowy owl**. 

Here's why:

* **Snowy owls** are living creatures. They have all the characteristics of life: they grow, reproduce, respond to their environment, need food and water, and are made up of cells.
* **Teddy bears, Mount Rushmore, and books** are inanimate objects. They do not possess the qualities of living organisms.

1068	1068	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
carving a piece of wood
dust settling out of the air
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Carving wood:**  This is a physical change. You're changing the shape of the wood, but not its chemical composition. It's still wood.
* **Dust settling:** This is also a physical change.  The dust particles are simply moving from the air to a surface.  Their chemical makeup remains the same.

**Key takeaway:** Physical changes alter the appearance or form of a substance but don't change its chemical makeup. Chemical changes result in the formation of new substances with different properties.

1069	1069	"Question: Based on this information, what is Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) wavy fur (1) straight fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Nutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.
 Solution: Nutmeg's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nutmeg's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."	"The answer is **(0) wavy fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The problem states that the allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive. This means that an individual must have two copies of the 'f' allele to express the wavy fur phenotype.
* **Nutmeg's Genotype:** Nutmeg has the genotype 'ff', meaning she has two copies of the recessive 'f' allele.
* **Phenotype Expression:** Since Nutmeg has two 'f' alleles, she will express the recessive phenotype, which is wavy fur.

My hair () in this humid weather!
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) refuses to behave (1) becomes so frizzy
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Complete the sentence with the phrase refuses to behave. It describes my hair as if it were a disobedient person."	"The answer is **(0) refuses to behave**. 

This choice uses personification because it gives the hair human-like qualities by suggesting it has the ability to act independently and be disobedient. 

Here's how it works:

* **Personification:** Attributing human qualities to inanimate objects or abstract concepts.
* **Sentence:** ""My hair **refuses to behave** in this humid weather!"" 
* **Explanation:**  The sentence makes it seem like the hair is intentionally being unruly, as if it has a mind of its own. 

The other option, ""becomes so frizzy,"" simply describes the hair's state without attributing any human-like characteristics.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The essay was printed in large type. (1) It bothered Jaylen that the essay wasn't finished.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses personification, giving human characteristics to nonhuman things.
Glared at him suggests that it bothered Jaylen that the essay wasn't finished. The essay is like a person who is bothering Jaylen."	"The correct answer is **(1) It bothered Jaylen that the essay wasn't finished.**

Here's why:

* **Personification:** The text uses personification by saying the essay ""glared"" at Jaylen.  Glaring is a human action, and it suggests that the essay is actively bothering or causing distress to Jaylen.
* **Implied Meaning:** The personification implies that Jaylen feels a strong sense of pressure or guilt about the unfinished essay. The essay is not literally glaring, but it feels like it is because of the way it's making Jaylen feel.

The choice (0) is incorrect because the size of the print is not mentioned in the text and is not relevant to the personification.

 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its speed (KE = 1/2 * mv^2).  A higher average speed means a higher average kinetic energy. 
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance.  The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.

Since sample A has a higher average particle speed, its particles have a higher average kinetic energy, and therefore, sample A has a higher temperature.

 Hint: Two mail trucks are loaded with mail. The trucks are the same. But they are carrying different amounts of mail.
 Solution: Look for the mail truck that is heavier.
A mail truck carrying 450 pounds of mail is heavier than a mail truck carrying 200 pounds of mail. So, the mail truck carrying 450 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other mail truck."	"The answer is **(1) a mail truck carrying 450 pounds of mail**. 

Here's why:

* **Newton's Second Law:** This law of motion states that the force needed to accelerate an object is directly proportional to its mass. In simpler terms, the heavier the object, the more force is needed to get it moving. 
* **The Mail Trucks:**  The truck carrying 450 pounds has a greater mass than the truck carrying 200 pounds.

 Solution: Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 670 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"The solution is correct! Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Speed is about distance and time:**  Speed measures how quickly something moves over a certain distance.  
* **Calculating speed:**  To find speed, we divide the distance traveled by the time it took.  
* **Comparing speeds:** Since all three motorboats traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours), the one that traveled the greatest distance (670 kilometers) must have been moving the fastest.

Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the icicle is harder. If you squeeze an icicle, it will not change shape, unless it starts to melt!"	"This is a great example of how to teach a concept through a simple task and clear reasoning. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

**Strengths:**

* **Concrete Example:**  Using ""hard"" as a property that relates to a material's ability to resist deformation is easy to understand, especially with the imagery of pushing on the objects.
* **Visual Aid:** The mention of pictures further emphasizes the visual aspect of the task. Children can easily imagine pressing on an icicle and a wool sweater.
* **Logical Explanation:** The solution clearly explains why an icicle is harder, connecting the property of hardness with its ability to resist changing shape.
* **Simple Language:** The explanation is kept simple and direct, using words that are likely familiar to the target audience. 

**Possible Improvements:**

* **Explicit Connection:** While the solution mentions imagining pushing, it could be more explicit by asking: ""Which of these objects would be harder to squeeze?""
* **Alternative Explanation:**  To reinforce the concept, you could also mention that wool is softer, thus giving another perspective.

**Overall:** This task is a fantastic way to introduce the concept of ""hardness"" in a fun and engaging manner. The clear explanation and visual imagery make it easy for children to grasp the idea.

* **Speed** is calculated by dividing distance by time (Speed = Distance / Time). 
* All three geese traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours).
* The goose that traveled 650 miles covered the greatest distance in that time. 

Therefore, this goose must have been moving at the highest speed.

Trent's leaving his job? That's old news. He's been planning that for months.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) oxymoron (1) euphemism
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Old news is a contradiction, because news is recent information."	"The correct answer is **(0) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:** A figure of speech that combines contradictory terms.  ""Old news"" is an oxymoron because news is typically considered current or recent information. 

The other choice, **euphemism**, is incorrect. A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt.  The text doesn't use a euphemism.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Kenneth will get to eat the cherries jubilee ice cream. He likes this flavor more than brownie batter. (1) Kenneth will give up the chance to get a free waffle cone. He would have enjoyed the waffle cone.
 Hint: Kenneth is deciding whether to get cherries jubilee ice cream or brownie batter ice cream. He likes cherries jubilee more than brownie batter. But a scoop of brownie batter ice cream comes with a free waffle cone.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Kenneth wants or needs:
Kenneth will give up the chance to get a free waffle cone. He would have enjoyed the waffle cone."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Cost is about giving up something.** When Kenneth chooses the cherries jubilee ice cream, he's giving up the opportunity to get the free waffle cone that comes with the brownie batter ice cream. 
* **He values the waffle cone.** The hint tells us he would have enjoyed the waffle cone, meaning it holds value for him.

**Therefore, giving up the free waffle cone is a cost associated with Kenneth's choice.**

1103	1103	"Question: What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
In response to his position on taxes, some journalists accused the candidate of engaging in doublethink.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Greek history (1) literature
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion doublethink is literature.
George Orwell's novel 1984 uses the term doublethink to describe simultaneously believing two opposite ideas, such as ""War is peace.""
The allusion doublethink means a contradictory belief."	"The answer is **(1) literature**. 

The term ""doublethink"" is most famously used in **George Orwell's novel *1984***. It describes the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs simultaneously, often through propaganda and manipulation. 

While the concept of holding contradictory beliefs could be found in various historical contexts, the specific term ""doublethink"" is strongly associated with Orwell's work and is therefore considered a literary allusion.

Jennifer, please stay away from the ocean. You shouldn't go in the water until you know how to swim.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) paradox (1) euphemism
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a paradox, a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
You shouldn't go in the water until you know how to swim at first appears to be contradictory, because it is impossible to learn how to swim without going in the water. However, it contains some truth: you should not go into deep or dangerous water without first knowing how to swim."	"The answer is **(0) paradox**. 

Here's why:

* **Paradox:** A paradox is a statement that seems contradictory or absurd but may contain a deeper truth.  The statement ""You shouldn't go in the water until you know how to swim"" seems contradictory because you can't learn to swim without being in the water. However, the underlying truth is that you shouldn't go into deep or dangerous water until you are proficient in swimming. 

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Euphemism:** A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. This doesn't apply to the text.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Samantha's collection of handmade pottery was featured in last week's edition of the Hillsdale Journal, which identified her as ""one of the most unique young artists to debut this year."" (1) Each vase and bowl in Samantha's collection of handmade pottery is unique. The colors and designs reflect both her cultural heritage and her individual artistic style.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
Each vase and bowl in Samantha's collection of handmade pottery is unique. The colors and designs reflect both her cultural heritage and her individual artistic style.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Samantha is a distinctive artist, but might not be one of a kind. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.
Samantha's collection of handmade pottery was featured in last week's edition of the Hillsdale Journal, which identified her as ""one of the most unique young artists to debut this year.""
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"The correct answer is **(1) Each vase and bowl in Samantha's collection of handmade pottery is unique. The colors and designs reflect both her cultural heritage and her individual artistic style.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional sense:** ""Unique"" traditionally means ""being the only one of its kind"".  In this context, each vase and bowl is truly one-of-a-kind due to the artist's individual style and design. 
* **Nontraditional sense:**  ""Unique"" is often used colloquially to mean ""interesting"" or ""unusual"". The first text uses it in this way when describing Samantha as ""one of the most unique young artists"".  While she might be distinctive, this doesn't mean she's the only artist of her kind. 

The second text emphasizes the singular and individual nature of each piece, aligning with the traditional meaning of ""unique"".

Ted waved goodbye to Brad as his train pulled out of the station.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
As Brad's train pulled out of the station, Ted waved goodbye to him."	"You're absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) Ted waved goodbye to Brad as his train pulled out of the station.**

Here's why:

* **The pronoun ""his"" is ambiguous.**  It could refer to either Ted's train or Brad's train. 
* **The first sentence (0) is clearer because it uses ""him"" specifically referring to Brad.** This removes any ambiguity about who is waving goodbye.

 Hint: This organism is a Grevy's zebra. Its scientific name is Equus grevyi.
 Solution: A Grevy's zebra's scientific name is Equus grevyi.
Cervus canadensis does not have the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, Equus grevyi and Cervus canadensis are not in the same species.
Macropus rufus does not have the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, Equus grevyi and Macropus rufus are not in the same species.
Equus grevyi has the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"The answer is **(2) Equus grevyi**. 

Here's why:

* **Species** are defined by the ability of organisms to interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Organisms in the same species share the same scientific name.

From the look on her face, Camille is carrying an albatross around her neck.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a poem (1) Egyptian history
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion an albatross around her neck is a poem.
In Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" a sailor shoots and kills an albatross, an action that curses the ship and crew. As his crew members die, the Ancient Mariner feels his guilt hanging like the albatross around his neck.
The allusion an albatross around her neck means a burden a person must bear."	"The answer is **(0) a poem**. 

You are absolutely right! The phrase ""carrying an albatross around her neck"" is an allusion to **Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner""**. 

In the poem, the mariner shoots an albatross, a bird considered to be good luck. This act brings a curse upon the ship and its crew, and the mariner is forced to wear the albatross around his neck as a symbol of his guilt and the burden of his actions. 

Therefore, the phrase is used to describe someone who is carrying a heavy burden of guilt, shame, or responsibility.

acid rain weathering a marble statue
chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a chemical change. When the flashlight is turned on, the chemicals in the battery react with each other to form new chemicals. This creates electricity, which powers the lightbulb.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Acid rain weathering a marble statue:** The acid in the rain reacts with the calcium carbonate in the marble, breaking it down into new compounds. This is a chemical change because the composition of the marble is altered.
* **Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight:**  The chemical reactions within the battery produce electricity.  This is a chemical change because the reactants (chemicals in the battery) are transformed into different products. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:** Neither change is directly caused by cooling.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:**  These are chemical changes, not physical changes. 
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  Neither change is directly caused by heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bat bones (1) air inside a raft (2) pair of dice (3) water in a fishbowl
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: A pair of dice is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you roll a pair of dice, the dice have a shape of their own. They are still cubes when they stop rolling.
The air inside a raft is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a raft expands to fill all the space inside the raft. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the raft.
A bat bone is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A bat bone has its own shape inside the bat.
The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour water from a fishbowl into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space."	"The correct answer is **(1) air inside a raft**. Here's why:

* **Gases** are substances that have no fixed shape or volume. They expand to fill the space they occupy. The air inside a raft behaves this way. 
* **Solids** have a fixed shape and volume. Bat bones and dice fit this description.
* **Liquids** have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container. Water in a fishbowl is an example.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that because a show is widely watched it is also trustworthy. However, a show's popularity does not necessarily indicate its trustworthiness. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."	"The correct answer is **(0) bandwagon fallacy**. 

Here's why:

* **Bandwagon fallacy:** This fallacy assumes that something is true or good simply because many people believe it or do it. The text states that because the news show is widely watched, it must be trustworthy. This is an example of the bandwagon fallacy because it equates popularity with truth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Slippery slope fallacy:** This fallacy argues that a small action will inevitably lead to a series of increasingly severe consequences.  The text doesn't make this argument.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Goura victoria (1) Strix nebulosa (2) Goura scheepmakeri
 Hint: This organism is a great gray owl. Its scientific name is Strix nebulosa.
 Solution: A great gray owl's scientific name is Strix nebulosa.
Goura scheepmakeri does not have the same scientific name as a great gray owl. So, Strix nebulosa and Goura scheepmakeri are not in the same species.
Strix nebulosa has the same scientific name as a great gray owl. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Goura victoria does not have the same scientific name as a great gray owl. So, Strix nebulosa and Goura victoria are not in the same species."	"The answer is **(1) Strix nebulosa**. 

Here's why:

* **Species Classification:** Organisms are classified into species based on their scientific names.
* **Strix nebulosa:** This is the scientific name for the Great Gray Owl. 
* **Other Choices:** The other options (Goura victoria and Goura scheepmakeri) are different species and belong to the bird family known as Crowned Pigeons. 

Therefore, only Strix nebulosa shares the same scientific name and is in the same species as the Great Gray Owl.

I never wear running shoes when I go jogging. Running with bare feet is how our ancient ancestors did it, so running shoes can't be better for your feet.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself (1) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good (2) ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that running shoes aren't good for your feet because our ancient ancestors did not wear running shoes. However, running shoes are not necessarily bad for your feet just because our ancient ancestors did not naturally have them in the past. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature."	"The correct answer is **(1) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good**. 

Here's why:

* The argument assumes that because ancient ancestors ran barefoot, it must be the best way to run. This is an appeal to nature fallacy because it equates ""natural"" with ""good"" without any evidence or consideration of how modern conditions and footwear might be different. 
* **Circular reasoning** would involve repeating the claim as evidence, which isn't the case here.
* **Ad hominem** would involve attacking the person making the argument, not their reasoning.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. (1) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(0) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2**. 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:**  In the images, Pair 2 has a greater distance between the magnets (2 inches) than Pair 1 (1 inch).
* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bobcat (1) black bear (2) black racer (3) gray fox
 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the parasol fungus.
There are two arrows pointing from the gray fox to other organisms. One arrow points to the bobcat. The only arrow pointing from the bobcat leads to the bolete fungus. The other arrow pointing from the gray fox leads to the bolete fungus. No arrows point from the bolete fungus to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the gray fox to the parasol fungus.
The only arrow pointing from the black racer leads to the bolete fungus. No arrows point from the bolete fungus to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the black racer to the parasol fungus.There is one path matter can take from the black bear to the parasol fungus: black bear->parasol fungus. There are two paths matter can take from the swallowtail caterpillar to the parasol fungus: swallowtail caterpillar->pine vole->parasol fungus. swallowtail caterpillar->black bear->parasol fungus. bobcat. The only arrow pointing from the bobcat leads to the bolete fungus. No arrows point from the bolete fungus to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bobcat to the parasol fungus.."	"The answer is (1). 

Here's how we can tell:

* **Follow the arrows:** The arrows in the food web show the direction of matter flow.
* **Find a path:** We need to find a path of arrows leading from the black bear to the parasol fungus. 
* **The direct path:**  There is a direct arrow from the black bear to the parasol fungus.

Therefore, matter from the black bear eventually moves to the parasol fungus.

1132	1132	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
making paper from wood
rust forming on a metal gate
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Making paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Making paper from wood:** This involves breaking down the complex structure of wood fibers and chemically treating them to form pulp, which then becomes paper. The chemical composition of the wood is altered, resulting in a new substance. 
* **Rust forming on a metal gate:** This is a chemical reaction called oxidation. Iron in the gate reacts with oxygen and moisture in the air to form iron oxide (rust). This is a completely different substance with different properties than the original iron.

**Key Takeaway:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions.

The salesperson tried hard to convince Emilio that the jacket was a good buy; after all, it was made of genuine imitation leather.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hyperbole (1) oxymoron
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Genuine imitation leather is a contradiction, because genuine means real, and imitation means fake or synthetic."	"The correct answer is **(1) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:** A figure of speech that combines contradictory terms (e.g., ""deafening silence"", ""living dead""). 
* **Hyperbole:** An exaggeration used for emphasis (e.g., ""I'm so hungry I could eat a horse"").

The phrase ""genuine imitation leather"" is a classic example of an oxymoron because it juxtaposes the words ""genuine"" (meaning real) and ""imitation"" (meaning fake).

Joey lives in a city where the wind often blows from the south throughout the year.
This passage tells you about the usual wind pattern where Joey lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"The correct answer is **(1) climate**. 

Here's why:

* **Climate** refers to the long-term average weather patterns of a region. The passage describes a consistent wind direction throughout the year, which is a characteristic of climate.

1142	1142	"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Our teeth are meant for eating meat. Our incisors and canines evolved to tear and rip flesh. Therefore, it must be unhealthy for humans to give up meat.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good (1) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (2) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that humans must eat meat because their teeth are naturally suited to eating it. However, a behavior isn't necessarily required simply because it's in our nature. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature."	"The correct answer is **(0) appeal to nature**. 

Here's why:

* **Appeal to nature:** This fallacy assumes that something is good, right, or natural simply because it's found in nature. The argument presented claims that because humans have teeth designed for tearing meat, they *must* eat meat. This ignores the fact that many other aspects of human nature (like our intelligence and adaptability) allow us to make choices that go beyond our biological predispositions. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Straw man:**  This fallacy misrepresents an opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. The text doesn't misrepresent any opposing view; it directly argues for meat consumption based on natural features.
* **Hasty generalization:** This fallacy draws a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. The argument doesn't make a general claim about all human behaviors; it focuses specifically on the connection between teeth and diet.

* **(0) 3,700 millimeters:** This is only about 3.7 meters, which is too short for a river.
* **(1) 3,700 meters:** This is 3.7 kilometers, still much too short for a major river like the Mississippi.
* **(2) 3,700 centimeters:** This is only 37 meters, which is definitely not the length of the Mississippi.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Raymond shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's a breakdown of why the second text uses ""terribly"" in its traditional sense:

* **Text 1:** ""Terribly steep"" is using ""terribly"" as a synonym for ""extremely"" or ""very.""  While this usage isn't incorrect, it's considered less formal and can be overused.
* **Text 2:** ""Shivered terribly"" means he shivered in a terrible, or extremely unpleasant, way.  This is the more traditional meaning of ""terribly,"" indicating the severity of his shivering.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 5 hours. The motorboat that moved 280 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"The solution is correct! Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time:**  Speed = Distance / Time
* **All boats traveled for the same time (5 hours):** This makes the comparison simple.
* **The boat that traveled 280 kilometers traveled the furthest:** Since the time is the same, the boat that covers the most distance must be moving the fastest.

**Therefore, the correct answer is (0) a motorboat that moved 280 kilometers south in 5 hours.**

 Solution: The text uses hyperbole, an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
The hyperbole for an eternity suggests that you have to wait in line for a very long time at the passport office. You do not literally have to wait in line for an infinite amount of time."	"The correct answer is **(0) You have to wait in line for a very long time at the passport office.**

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole:** The phrase ""an eternity"" is a clear exaggeration. It's not meant to be taken literally that you'll wait forever.
* **Meaning:**  The hyperbole is used to emphasize the point that waiting in line at the passport office can take a very long time.  The author is exaggerating the length of the wait to highlight the inconvenience and make a point about scheduling an appointment.

**Option (1)** is partially correct, but it doesn't capture the specific exaggeration of the hyperbole. While spending time at the passport office might be unpleasant, the hyperbole ""an eternity"" is specifically about the *length* of the wait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) green algae (1) black crappie (2) golden algae
 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea and the rotifer. The water flea are the rotifer are both primary consumers, so the black crappie is a secondary consumer.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a primary consumer, so the copepod is a secondary consumer.
The golden algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer.
The green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer."	The answer is (1).	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force depends on the size of the magnets. Larger magnets have a stronger magnetic field.
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:**  The magnets in both pairs are made of the same material, but the ring magnet in Pair 1 is larger than the ring magnet in Pair 2. This means the magnetic force in Pair 1 is stronger.
* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** Whether magnets attract or repel determines the direction of the force, not its strength.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
Megan made all of her daughter's baby clothes by hand, including a unique hand-knitted romper that she designed herself.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Megan may have been looking for an unusual name, but if she found it on a baby name website, it is not actually one of a kind.
Megan wanted her daughter to have a unique name, so she browsed baby name websites for months to find the perfect one.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"The correct answer is **(1) Megan made all of her daughter's baby clothes by hand, including a unique hand-knitted romper that she designed herself.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional Sense:** In this sentence, ""unique"" refers to the romper being the *only* one of its kind. It was hand-knitted and designed by Megan, making it truly unique. 
* **Nontraditional Sense:**  In sentence (0), ""unique"" is used to mean ""unusual"" or ""interesting"". It implies the name Megan was looking for was different from common names, but not necessarily one-of-a-kind.

The key to understanding the difference lies in the context.  When ""unique"" implies something is the only one of its kind, it's used in its traditional sense.

 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Deafening silence is a contradiction, because deafening describes something extremely loud, and silence is the absence of sound."	"The correct answer is **(1) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:** A figure of speech that combines contradictory terms, creating a paradoxical effect. ""Deafening silence"" perfectly fits this definition.
* **Euphemism:** A mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. This doesn't apply to the text.

 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.
Jupiter, a leopard from this group, has a black coat. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat (a). So, Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa."	"The correct answer is **(0) aa**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  The genetic makeup of an organism, represented by the combination of alleles.
* **Allele:**  A variation of a gene.
* **Phenotype:** The physical expression of a gene. 

Since Jupiter has a black coat, we know his phenotype is ""black coat"".  We are also told that the allele ""a"" results in a black coat.  Therefore, Jupiter must have two copies of the ""a"" allele, making his genotype **aa**.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that a single typo indicates that a book is terrible. However, one typo does not necessarily reflect the quality of the rest of the book. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."	"The correct answer is **(2) hasty generalization**. 

Here's why:

* **Hasty Generalization:** The speaker jumps to a conclusion about the entire book based on a single instance (the typo). They are making a broad claim about the book's quality without sufficient evidence.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **Guilt by Association:** This fallacy involves associating something with a negative attribute to discredit it. The text doesn't associate the book with anything else to make it seem bad.
* **Slippery Slope Fallacy:** This fallacy argues that one small step will lead to a chain of negative consequences. The text doesn't suggest a chain of events. It focuses on the single typo leading to a judgment about the entire book.

 Solution: The first text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Garrett literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.
The second text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). Garrett's mouth may be in pain, but it is not actually on fire.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Garrett's mouth was literally on fire by the time he finished his meal.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."	"The answer is **(0) The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Garrett literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional ""literally""** means something happened exactly as stated, without exaggeration. In this sentence, Garrett *actually* drank three glasses of milk.  The word ""literally"" emphasizes that this is a factual statement.
* **Non-traditional ""literally""** is often used for emphasis or hyperbole. In choice (1), Garrett's mouth is not literally on fire, but the phrase is used to express the intense burning sensation he felt.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.**

The magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnets. This means that as the distance between the magnets increases, the magnetic force decreases. 

In Pair 1, the magnets are 2 inches apart, while in Pair 2, the magnets are 5 inches apart. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Firing clay is caused by heating. But a penny tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Tarnishing:** A penny tarnishing is a chemical change because the copper in the penny reacts with oxygen in the air, forming a new substance (copper oxide) which is duller and green in color. 
* **Firing Clay:**  Firing clay in a kiln is also a chemical change. The heat causes the clay particles to bond together through a process called sintering, forming a new, harder substance.

**Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  This is incorrect because both processes involve a change in the chemical composition of the substances.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:**  This is partially true for the clay pot but not for the penny. Tarnishing can happen at room temperature.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  This is incorrect. Neither process is primarily driven by cooling.

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is the amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
* **Solution A** has 15 green particles in 40 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 8 green particles in 40 mL of solvent.

Since Solution A has more solute particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) First, a layer of sand was deposited. Later, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited. (1) First, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited. Later, a layer of sand was deposited.
 Hint: The text below describes how an area's environment changed over time. Read the text. Then answer the question.

Figure 1: sediment deposited by a fast-flowing river.
A fast-flowing river deposited heavy sediment grains along its banks. Light sediment such as mud was carried away by the strong water current.

Figure 2: sediment deposited in a desert.
Over thousands of years, the river dried up, and the area became a desert. In the desert, sediment was deposited by wind.
 Solution: The environment in the area changed over time. Use the pictures to figure out the type of sediment deposited in each environment.
Later, the area became a desert. A layer of sand was deposited by wind."	"The answer is **(1) First, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited. Later, a layer of sand was deposited.**

Here's why:

* **Figure 1:** Shows a fast-flowing river depositing heavy sediment like sand and pebbles. This suggests the initial sediment layer was a mix of sand and pebbles.
* **Figure 2:** Depicts a desert environment where wind carries and deposits primarily sand. This indicates that a later layer of sand was deposited on top of the earlier sand and pebble layer.

Kristen entered the bustling, aromatic spice market in Istanbul and said to her travel companion, ""We're not in Kansas anymore.""
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a movie (1) a poem
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion We're not in Kansas anymore is a movie.
In the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy, a young farm girl from Kansas, finds herself in Oz, an unusual place that looks nothing like her home. She says to her dog, ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.""
The allusion We're not in Kansas anymore means we're in an unfamiliar place."	"The answer is **(0) a movie**. 

The phrase ""We're not in Kansas anymore"" is a direct quote from the 1939 film *The Wizard of Oz*.  Dorothy, the main character, utters this line after she arrives in Oz, a fantastical and strange land very different from her home in Kansas. 

This phrase has become a popular idiom to express the feeling of being in a completely different and unexpected environment.

It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend.
—William Blake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) apostrophe (1) paradox
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a paradox, a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend at first appears to be contradictory, as it should be difficult to forgive someone whom you oppose. However, there is some truth to it: it is more hurtful when your friend does something to wrong you than when your enemy does, making it harder to forgive the person close to you."	"The correct answer is **(1) paradox**. 

Here's why:

* **Paradox:**  A paradox is a statement that seems contradictory or absurd, but may contain a deeper truth. The quote from William Blake fits this definition. It seems counterintuitive that forgiving an enemy would be easier than forgiving a friend.
* **Apostrophe:** Apostrophe is a figure of speech where a speaker directly addresses someone or something absent, inanimate, or  dead. This is not present in the quote. 

The quote uses the paradox to highlight the complex nature of forgiveness and the deeper pain that can come from betrayal by someone you trust.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not an omnivore.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. The plainfin midshipman also has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. The plainfin midshipman eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton, the plainfin midshipman, and the black rockfish, which are consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.
The sea urchin has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the kelp, which is a producer. So, the sea urchin is a consumer but not an omnivore."	"The answer is **(0) plainfin midshipman**. Here's why:

"The correct answer is **(0) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other**. 

Here's why:

* The text establishes a correlation between rising temperatures and a decrease in piracy.  
* It *assumes* that the rising temperature is the cause of the decreased piracy. 
* **This is a classic example of false causation**, also known as the ""post hoc ergo propter hoc"" fallacy.  Just because two events occur close in time, doesn't mean one caused the other. There could be entirely different, unrelated reasons for the decrease in piracy.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1**.

The magnitude of the magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnets. This means that as the distance between the magnets increases, the magnetic force decreases.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 2 has a greater distance (11.8 mm) between the magnets than Pair 1 (6.9 mm).  
* **Conclusion:** Because the magnets in Pair 2 are further apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.

 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It depends on both an object's mass and its velocity (speed). The equation for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2 * mv², where m is mass and v is velocity.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.
* **The Scenario:**  Both samples have the same average particle speed (590 m/s), but the particles in sample A are heavier (34 u) than the particles in sample B (28 u). 
* **Conclusion:** Since the particles in sample A have more mass and the same speed as the particles in sample B, they have higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, sample A has the higher temperature.

 Solution: The first text uses factoid in its traditional sense: something made up presented as a true fact.
Hassan seemed to know a lot about African wildlife, but it turned out that his knowledge was mostly based on factoids gleaned from unreliable websites.
The second text uses factoid in its nontraditional sense: a trivial but true fact.
Hassan subscribed to an online newsletter about African wildlife; he enjoyed receiving daily factoids about the wild animals' natural habitats and behavior.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word factoid because it is considered more standard."	"The answer is **(0) Hassan seemed to know a lot about African wildlife, but it turned out that his knowledge was mostly based on factoids gleaned from unreliable websites.**

Here's why:

* **Factoid in its traditional sense:**  A factoid is a piece of information that is presented as a fact, but is actually false or misleading. The first sentence implies that Hassan's knowledge was based on unreliable information, making the ""factoids"" inaccurate.

* **Factoid in its nontraditional sense:**  A factoid can also be a small, interesting, or trivial fact. The second sentence uses the word ""factoids"" to refer to real information about African wildlife, but it doesn't imply that the information is false.

**Therefore, the first sentence uses the word ""factoid"" in its traditional sense of a false or misleading piece of information.**

butter melting on a hot day
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Butter melting:** This is a change of state (solid to liquid) and doesn't alter the chemical composition of the butter. It's a physical change.
* **Sediment settling:** This is a process of separation where heavier particles sink to the bottom. The sediment and water remain chemically unchanged. It's a physical change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  While cooling can cause some substances to solidify, this is not the case for these scenarios. Butter melts due to heat, and sediment settles due to gravity.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** Only butter melting is directly caused by heating. Sediment settling is due to gravity.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties.  Neither butter melting nor sediment settling creates new substances.

 Hint: Andrew is deciding whether to take a trip to California or Georgia. He wants to enjoy his trip. But he is also trying to save money.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Andrew wants or needs:
Andrew will give up the chance to go to California. He would have enjoyed a trip to California more than Georgia."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why **(1) Andrew will give up the chance to go to California. He would have enjoyed a trip to California more than Georgia.** is the correct answer:

* **Opportunity Cost:** The concept of ""cost"" in economics often refers to **opportunity cost**. This is the value of the next best alternative that you forgo when making a choice. 
* **Andrew's Decision:** In this case, Andrew is choosing Georgia over California. By doing so, he gives up the opportunity to experience California, which he values more. This is a cost, even though he doesn't spend money directly on California.

**Let's look at why choice (0) is incorrect:**

* **Saving Money:** While saving money might be a benefit of choosing Georgia, it's not the defining characteristic of a cost in this context.  
* **Not a Direct Trade-off:** The fact that Georgia plane tickets are cheaper is not a direct result of choosing Georgia. It's a separate factor that influences the decision but doesn't represent the cost of giving up California. 

**In conclusion, the cost of Andrew's decision is the enjoyment and experience he sacrifices by choosing Georgia over California.**

 Hint: Figure: Everglades National Park.
Everglades National Park is a wetland ecosystem in southern Florida.
 Solution: A wetland is a type of ecosystem. Wetlands have the following features: land that is covered with water during most of the year, soil that is rich in nutrients, and other water ecosystems nearby. So, Everglades National Park has land that is covered with water during most of the year. It also has other water ecosystems nearby."	"The answer is **(1) It has land that is covered in water during most of the year. It also has other water ecosystems nearby.**

Here's why:

* **Wetland Characteristics:** Everglades National Park is a wetland ecosystem, meaning it's characterized by waterlogged soil, the presence of water for a significant portion of the year, and unique plant and animal adaptations.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Pair Comparison:**  Pair 2 has a greater distance between the magnets (23.8 mm) compared to Pair 1 (10.9 mm).
* **Force Strength:** Since the distance is greater in Pair 2, the magnetic force between the magnets will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 2:2 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cucumber plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with bumpy fruit or smooth fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for bumpy fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for smooth fruit.
Bumpy fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with bumpy fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
Smooth fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to offspring with smooth fruit is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with bumpy fruit. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with smooth fruit."	"The answer is **(4) 0:4**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant vs. Recessive:** The problem states that the allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f). This means that a plant with at least one ""F"" allele will have bumpy fruit.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes are ""ff,"" meaning all offspring will have two recessive alleles.
* **Phenotype:** Since all offspring have the ""ff"" genotype, they will all express the recessive trait, resulting in smooth fruit. 

Therefore, the ratio of bumpy fruit to smooth fruit offspring is 0:4.

Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Burning a candle:** The flame of the candle is a result of the heat from the burning wick. This heat melts the wax and causes it to vaporize, which then reacts with oxygen in a combustion reaction.
* **Burning a marshmallow:** The fire provides the heat that causes the marshmallow to change. The heat causes the sugars in the marshmallow to caramelize and burn, turning it black and crispy. 

While both are chemical changes (the composition of the materials changes), the common factor is that both are **initiated by heat**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. (2) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.  
* **Comparison:** Pair 1 has magnets that are 3 cm apart, while Pair 2 has magnets that are 5 cm apart. Since Pair 1's magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger.

1321	1321	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) smooth leaves (1) fuzzy leaves
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype LL for the leaf texture gene.
 Solution: The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is LL. The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for fuzzy leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves."	"The answer is **(1) fuzzy leaves**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype LL, meaning it has two dominant alleles for fuzzy leaves.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
* **Phenotype:**  Since the plant has at least one dominant allele (L), it will express the dominant trait, which is **fuzzy leaves**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 145°F (1) a pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 185°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 145°F pot of spaghetti sauce is colder than the 185°F pot of spaghetti sauce, it has less thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) a pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 145°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles. 
* **Higher temperature means higher average kinetic energy**, which means more thermal energy.

Since the 145°F pot of spaghetti sauce is at a lower temperature than the 185°F pot, it has less thermal energy.

1323	1323	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the thorns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having thorns (1) not having thorns
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
A certain rose plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the thorns gene.
 Solution: You need to determine the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the thorns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be having thorns."	"The correct answer is **(0) having thorns**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype Rr, meaning it has one dominant allele (R) for thorns and one recessive allele (r) for no thorns.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant. This means that even with one copy of the dominant allele, the plant will express the dominant trait.
* **Phenotype:** The phenotype is the physical expression of the genotype. Since the plant has at least one dominant allele (R), its phenotype will be **having thorns**.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Professor Harrell's research is untrustworthy because someone else at her university was caught falsifying data. However, this isn't necessarily true. The practices of one researcher at a university do not necessarily reflect the practices of another researcher at the same university.

 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and velocity (speed). The formula for kinetic energy is: KE = 1/2 * mv² 
* **Equal Speeds:** Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,000 m/s).
* **Different Masses:** The particles in sample B have a higher mass (44 u) than the particles in sample A (28 u).
* **Higher Kinetic Energy:** Since the particles in sample B have more mass and the same speed as the particles in sample A, they have a higher average kinetic energy. 
* **Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  Therefore, sample B, with its higher average kinetic energy, must have a higher temperature.

Making lemonade is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Making lemonade is a physical change. The sugar, water, and lemon juice are mixed together. But they do not change into different types of matter."	"The correct answer is **(0) physical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Physical Change:**  A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition.  The molecules themselves remain the same.  
    * Examples:  Melting ice, cutting paper, dissolving sugar in water.
* **Chemical Change:**  A change where a new substance is formed with different chemical properties.  The molecules rearrange themselves.
    * Examples: Burning wood, rusting iron, baking a cake.

Making lemonade is a physical change because you are simply mixing ingredients together.  The sugar, water, and lemon juice remain the same molecules even though they are combined. There's no new substance formed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a white body (1) bb
 Hint: In a group of Channel catfish, some individuals have a brown body and others have a white body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a brown body, and the allele b is for a white body.
A certain Channel catfish from this group has a white body. This catfish has two alleles for a white body.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The Channel catfish has two alleles for a white body (b). So, the catfish's genotype for the body color gene is bb."	"The solution is correct! 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  The genotype represents the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a particular gene.
* **Alleles:** Alleles are alternate forms of a gene.  In this case, 'B' represents the brown body allele and 'b' represents the white body allele.
* **Phenotype:**  The phenotype is the physical expression of the genotype, in this case, the color of the catfish's body.

Since the catfish has a white body, we know it must have two copies of the 'b' allele (bb). This is because the 'b' allele is recessive, meaning it only expresses its trait (white body) if there are two copies present.

a copper statue turning green
boiling sugar to make caramel
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Copper statue turning green:** This is a chemical reaction called oxidation. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air, forming a new substance (copper oxide) which is green.
* **Boiling sugar to make caramel:**  The heat causes the sugar molecules to break down and rearrange, forming new molecules with different properties (caramel). This is a chemical change because the composition of the substance has changed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Only the boiling sugar process involves heating. The copper statue turning green is a reaction with oxygen at room temperature.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical composition. These changes are chemical. 
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:** Only the boiling sugar process is directly caused by heating. The copper statue turning green is a reaction with oxygen, which happens naturally.

 Hint: Figure: Gran Sabana.
The Gran Sabana is a savanna grassland ecosystem in southeastern Venezuela.
 Solution: A savanna grassland is a type of ecosystem. Savanna grasslands have the following features: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. So, the Gran Sabana has a rainy season and a dry season. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients."	"The answer is **(0) It has a rainy season and a dry season. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.** 

Here's why:

* **Savanna grasslands** are characterized by a distinct rainy season and a dry season. This pattern is crucial for the survival of the plants and animals adapted to this environment.
* The soil in savanna ecosystems is often poor in nutrients due to factors like heavy rainfall that leaches nutrients and the decomposition of organic matter.

While savannas experience warm temperatures year-round, option (1) incorrectly suggests year-round rain, which is not typical of savanna ecosystems.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the gold bar with more thermal energy (1) the gold bar with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two 6-kilogram gold bars are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two gold bars are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the gold bar with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) the gold bar with more thermal energy**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a system due to the motion of its atoms and molecules.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a system.

Think of it like this:  If you have two identical containers of water, one heated to boiling and the other at room temperature, the boiling water has much more thermal energy.  This is because its molecules are moving faster and have a higher average kinetic energy, which translates to a higher temperature. 

The same principle applies to the gold bars. The bar with more thermal energy has more energetic particles, resulting in a higher temperature.

1384	1384	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Rotting sandwich:** This involves the breakdown of organic matter (the sandwich) into simpler substances due to microbial activity. This is a clear chemical change.
* **Polishing a tarnished spoon:**  Tarnish is a chemical reaction where silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form silver sulfide. Polishing removes this tarnish by converting the silver sulfide into a different compound that can be wiped away. This is also a chemical change. 

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are only physical changes:**  This is incorrect because both processes involve changes in the chemical composition of the substances.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** Neither process is primarily caused by heating.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither process is primarily caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It depends on both an object's mass and its speed. The equation for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where m is mass and v is speed.
* **Equal Speeds:** Both samples have particles with the same average speed (1,400 m/s).
* **Different Masses:** The particles in sample B are heavier (46 u) than the particles in sample A (28 u).
* **Higher Kinetic Energy:** Since the particles in sample B have the same speed but greater mass, they have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Therefore, the sample with higher average kinetic energy (sample B) will have the higher temperature.

 Hint: Jeffrey is deciding whether to see the zebras or the gibbons at the zoo. He wants to see lots of animals, but the zoo is closing soon.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Jeffrey wants or needs:
Jeffrey will spend more time walking to the zebras. They are on the other side of the zoo, but the gibbons are close by."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why choice (1) is a cost:

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Jeffrey has limited time at the zoo. Choosing to see the zebras means he's spending more time walking and potentially less time seeing other animals. This is an opportunity cost – the value of what he's giving up (seeing other animals) by choosing the zebras. 

Let's look at why choice (0) isn't a cost:

* **Subjective Preference:**  While this might be true, it doesn't represent a cost. It's a personal preference and doesn't involve any resource or time expenditure.

**Key Takeaway:** Costs are about what you give up or spend when making a choice. In this case, Jeffrey's cost is the extra time spent walking, which could be used to see more animals.

 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Lola wants or needs:
Lola will spend more time making the cream of mushroom soup than she would have spent making the minestrone soup."	"You are absolutely correct! Here's why:

* **Opportunity Cost:** The concept of opportunity cost is central to understanding costs in economics.  It means that when you choose one option, you are giving up the opportunity to choose another.

* **Lola's Dilemma:** Lola is facing an opportunity cost. By choosing to make cream of mushroom soup, she's sacrificing the time she could have spent making minestrone soup. This means she'll have to wait longer for dinner.

Draco, a government official in seventh-century Athens, Greece, wrote a code of laws that called for severe punishments for even minor offenses.
The allusion draconian means harsh."	"The answer is **(1) Greek history**. 

Here's why:

* **Draconian** is an adjective that refers to something extremely harsh or severe, especially in terms of laws or punishments. 
* The word comes from **Draco**, an Athenian lawgiver who lived in the 7th century BC. His code of laws was notorious for its harsh punishments, including the death penalty for even minor offenses.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 0:4 (2) 3:1 (3) 1:3 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight fur or curly fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for curly fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for straight fur.
Straight fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the dominant version of the fur type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur type gene. So, offspring with straight fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Curly fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the recessive version of the fur type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur type gene. So, offspring with curly fur must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with straight fur to offspring with curly fur is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with straight fur. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with curly fur."	"The answer is **(4) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant vs. Recessive:** The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant, meaning an individual with at least one 'F' will have straight fur. The curly fur allele (f) is recessive, requiring two 'f' alleles to express curly fur.

* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows all possible combinations of alleles from the parents. There are no boxes with the genotype 'ff' (which is required for curly fur).

* **Outcome:**  This means that all offspring will have at least one 'F' allele, resulting in straight fur. The ratio is 4:0, representing 4 straight fur offspring to 0 curly fur offspring.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that as the distance decreases, the magnetic force increases significantly. 
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 2 has a smaller distance between the magnets (0.2 cm) compared to Pair 1 (0.45 cm).  Since the distance is smaller in Pair 2, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be stronger.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is (2).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity.
* **Higher Mass and Speed:** Sample B has particles with higher mass and higher average speed than Sample A. Both of these factors contribute to a higher kinetic energy. 
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:**  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance.  Since Sample B has higher average kinetic energy, it has the higher temperature.

 Hint: Haley is deciding whether to watch a comedy or an action movie. She would prefer to watch a comedy. But she also wants to watch a movie with her sister. Haley's sister will only watch an action movie.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Haley wants or needs:
Haley will give up the chance to watch a movie with her sister."	"The correct answer is **(1) Haley will give up the chance to watch a movie with her sister.**

Here's why:

* **Cost** in economics means giving up something you value to get something else.
* Haley values watching both the comedy and spending time with her sister.
* By choosing the comedy, she sacrifices the opportunity to watch a movie with her sister. This is a **cost** of her decision.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy (1) the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two bowls of oatmeal are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total energy of all the particles within a substance.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those particles.

So, if one bowl of oatmeal has more thermal energy, it means its particles are moving, on average, faster than the particles in the bowl with less thermal energy. This faster movement translates to a higher temperature.

 Solution: This poem has a regular rhythm, or a pattern of sound like a beat. The parts in bold show the strong syllables. The pattern is a weak syllable followed by a strong syllable. It sounds like da-DUM da-DUM.
As if to hide from view."	"The correct answer is **(0) Within a green and shady bed
A modest violet grew;
Its stalk was bent, it hung its head,
As if to hide from view.**

Here's why:

* **Rhythm:** This excerpt from Jane Taylor's ""The Violet"" has a consistent iambic tetrameter rhythm. Iambic means a weak syllable followed by a strong syllable (da-DUM). Tetrameter means there are four of these iambs in each line. 
* **Example:** ""**With**in a **green** and **sha**dy **bed**""  - Notice the pattern of weak-strong syllables.

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **(1) It was all so dull—
Except a few gray legs under shiny black umbrellas
Running along the gray shiny sidewalks.**  This excerpt doesn't have a consistent rhythm. The number of syllables in each line varies, and there's no clear pattern of weak-strong syllables.

1448	1448	"Question: Which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution A (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution B
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles."	"The answer is **(0) Solution A**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 10 yellow particles in 40 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 6 yellow particles in 40 mL of solvent. 

Since Solution A has more solute particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

1449	1449	"Question: Which figure of speech is used in this text?
""Your new hairstyle is so boring!"" Shane remarked when his sister showed up with a pink-and-blue mohawk.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) verbal irony (1) simile
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Boring shows verbal irony because Shane's sister's hairstyle is not at all boring."	"The answer is **(0) verbal irony**. 

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that contradicts their true meaning.  Shane is clearly exaggerating and being sarcastic when he calls the mohawk ""boring.""  
* **Simile** uses words like ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two things.  This is not present in the text. 

The key to identifying verbal irony is to look for a discrepancy between what is said and what is actually meant. In this case, the mohawk is anything but boring, making Shane's statement ironic.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 75 yards (1) 75 feet (2) 75 inches (3) 75 miles
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the length of a tennis court is 75 feet.
75 inches is too short. 75 yards and 75 miles are too long."	"You got it right! The answer is **(1) 75 feet**. 

Here's why:

* **75 inches** is about the length of a standard door, way too short for a tennis court.
* **75 yards** is a bit over the length of a football field, also too long.
* **75 miles** is the distance between some cities, obviously far too long for a tennis court. 

75 feet is the most reasonable length for a tennis court.

1451	1451	"Question: What does the idiom in this text suggest?
Mr. and Mrs. Gregory usually see eye to eye, but not when it comes to the controversial mayoral race.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Mr. and Mrs. Gregory usually agree. (1) Mr. and Mrs. Gregory are not politically active.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an idiom, an expression that cannot be understood literally.
The idiom see eye to eye suggests that Mr. and Mrs. Gregory usually agree. When you see eye to eye with someone, you share their opinion."	"The correct answer is **(0) Mr. and Mrs. Gregory usually agree.**

Here's why:

* **""See eye to eye""** is an idiom that means to agree with someone or to have the same opinion. 
* The sentence states that Mr. and Mrs. Gregory *usually* see eye to eye. This implies they typically agree on things.
* The sentence then contrasts this by saying they *don't* agree on the mayoral race, highlighting their differing opinions on this specific issue.

Choice (1) is incorrect because the text doesn't give any indication about their political activity level. The focus is solely on their agreement or disagreement on specific issues.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Sarracenia purpurea (1) Lynx pardinus (2) Ardea cocoi
 Hint: This organism is a purple heron. Its scientific name is Ardea purpurea.
 Solution: A purple heron's scientific name is Ardea purpurea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Sarracenia purpurea and Ardea purpurea are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Sarracenia purpurea and Ardea purpurea have the same species name within their genus, purpurea. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Sarracenia purpurea is in the genus Sarracenia, and Ardea purpurea is in the genus Ardea.
Ardea cocoi is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea cocoi and Ardea purpurea are in the same genus.
Lynx pardinus is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx pardinus and Ardea purpurea are not in the same genus."	"The answer is **(2) Ardea cocoi**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:**  Scientific names follow a two-part system (binomial nomenclature): 
    * The first part is the **genus**.
    * The second part is the **species**.
* **Purple Heron:** The purple heron's scientific name is *Ardea purpurea*. This means it belongs to the genus *Ardea*.
* **Ardea cocoi:** This scientific name also starts with *Ardea*, indicating it's in the same genus as the purple heron.

 Solution: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun she could refer to Susan or Kate.
Susan looks almost identical to her twin sister Kate, but she has pierced ears.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Susan has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Kate."	"You are absolutely correct! The second choice, **(1) Susan looks almost identical to her twin sister Kate, but she has pierced ears.** contains a vague pronoun reference. 

Here's why:

* **The pronoun ""she"" could refer to either Susan or Kate.**  The sentence doesn't make it clear which twin has the pierced ears.

The first choice, **(0) Susan has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Kate.** correctly clarifies the pronoun reference by explicitly stating that ""she"" refers to Susan.

 Solution: A movie should be in italics.
The correct title is **The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle**."	"You are absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) ***The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle*****.

Here's why:

* **Italics are used for titles of longer works, such as books, movies, and albums.**  This helps distinguish them from other text. 
* **Quotation marks are typically used for shorter works, such as songs, poems, or articles.** 

Therefore, the correct way to display the title of the movie ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" is in italics.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ms. Malone has several important proposals to discuss at the next city council meeting. (1) There are some things that Ms. Malone wants to bring up at the next city council meeting.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (some things, bring up).
The first sentence uses more precise language, so it is more formal overall."	"You are absolutely right! 

**Sentence (0) is more formal.**

Here's why:

* **Precise Language:**  ""Several important proposals"" is much more specific and professional than ""some things.""
* **Active Voice:** ""Ms. Malone has... to discuss""  is in active voice, making the sentence more direct and assertive.
* **Formal Diction:**  ""Proposals"" and ""discuss"" are more formal terms than ""bring up.""

Sentence (1) is more casual and conversational, which makes it less appropriate for a formal context like a city council meeting.

Whitney rubbed coconut oil on her hands, which were like the parched earth during a drought.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Whitney's hands were hot. (1) Whitney's hands were dry and cracked.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text includes a simile, using like or as to compare two things that are not actually alike.
The simile like the parched earth during a drought suggests that Whitney's hands were dry and cracked. A drought is a period without rain; the ground during a drought can become hard and cracked."	"The correct answer is **(1) Whitney's hands were dry and cracked.** 

Here's why:

* **Simile:** The text uses the simile ""like the parched earth during a drought"" to compare Whitney's hands to something else.
* **Parched Earth:**  Parched earth is dry, cracked, and lacking moisture. 
* **Connection:**  The simile directly suggests that Whitney's hands are in a similar condition – dry and cracked, just like parched earth. 

The simile doesn't imply that Whitney's hands are hot, so option (0) is incorrect.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black bear has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree. The persimmon tree is a producer, so the black bear is a primary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is a producer, so the beaver is a primary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a primary consumer.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not a primary consumer.
The gray fox has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the pine vole. Neither the swallowtail caterpillar nor the pine vole is a producer, so the gray fox is not a primary consumer."	"The answer is **(2) beaver**. 

Here's why:

* **Primary Consumers:**  These organisms eat producers (plants). In this food web, the beaver eats the silver maple, a producer.
* **Other Choices:**
    * **(0) gray fox:**  The gray fox eats consumers, not producers.

(1) Camels in the wild tend to eat an apparently random assortment of leaves, grasses, shrubs, and other plant matter. As an adaptation to their native desert environment, they are able to eat even thorny and salt-heavy plants that most animals will reject.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first text uses random in its traditional sense: made or occurring without a definite pattern.
Camels in the wild tend to eat an apparently random assortment of leaves, grasses, shrubs, and other plant matter. As an adaptation to their native desert environment, they are able to eat even thorny and salt-heavy plants that most animals will reject.
The second text uses random in its nontraditional sense: odd or out of place.
During the nineteenth century, the U.S. Army used camels as pack animals in the Southwest. Though the program was discontinued after the outbreak of the Civil War, reported sightings of random camels throughout the Southwest continued through at least the 1940 s.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word random because it is generally considered incorrect."	"You are absolutely correct! The first text uses ""random"" in its traditional sense, meaning ""without a definite pattern."" 

Here's why:

* **Text 1:** The sentence states that camels eat a ""random assortment"" of plants. This implies that there is no specific order or preference in their diet, and they eat whatever is available.

* **Text 2:**  The sentence describes ""random camels."" This is an unusual phrasing and uses ""random"" in a way that suggests the camels were unexpected or out of place, not that their appearance was without a pattern.  

You are also right to point out the common style guide recommendation to avoid using ""random"" in the sense of ""odd"" or ""out of place."" It can lead to confusion and misinterpretation.

silver jewelry tarnishing
boiling sugar to make caramel
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But silver tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Silver tarnishing:** This is a chemical reaction where silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form silver sulfide (the black tarnish). The silver has changed its chemical composition. 
* **Boiling sugar to make caramel:**  This is a chemical change where the sugar molecules break down and rearrange due to the heat, resulting in a new substance (caramel) with different properties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  Both changes involve a change in the chemical makeup of the substance, making them chemical changes, not physical ones.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While heating is a factor in making caramel, silver tarnishing can occur at room temperature due to exposure to sulfur in the air.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:** Neither of these changes is caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) scratchy (1) fuzzy (2) hard
 Hint: Select the best answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
A fuzzy object is covered in soft hair. The wool sweater is fuzzy, but the sandpaper is not.
A hard object does not change shape when pressed or squeezed. The tree bark is hard, but the wool sweater is not.
A scratchy object is rough and itchy against your skin. All three objects are scratchy.
The property that all three objects have in common is scratchy."	"The answer is **(0) scratchy**. 

Here's why:

* **Tree bark** is known for its rough, scratchy texture.
* **Wool sweaters**, while fuzzy, can also feel scratchy depending on the type of wool. 
* **Sandpaper** is designed to be scratchy, used for smoothing surfaces. 

The other options are not common to all three objects:

1483	1483	"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
The human resource department is urging the company to offer free gym memberships to all employees. They'd rather our employees be at the gym morning, noon, and night, than get any work done.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that free gym memberships will result in lower productivity. However, offering free gym memberships doesn't necessarily suggest that employees will spend all their time at the gym rather than at work. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."	"The correct answer is **(0) straw man**. 

Here's why:

* **Straw Man:** The argument misrepresents the HR department's position. They are likely advocating for free gym memberships as a way to improve employee health and well-being, which could potentially lead to increased productivity. The text twists this into a claim that HR wants employees to neglect their work entirely. This is a misrepresentation of the actual argument.

Wesley has naturally curly hair.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Some humans are born with naturally curly hair. Others are born with naturally straight hair. Curly and straight are examples of hair texture.
Some people decide to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally curly hair is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(1) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to their children through genes. Hair texture is determined by genes.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or learning. 

Wesley's curly hair is a characteristic he was born with, making it an inherited trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the cherry pie with more thermal energy (1) the cherry pie with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two cherry pies are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two cherry pies are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cherry pie with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."	"The correct answer is **(0) the cherry pie with more thermal energy**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:** Thermal energy is the total energy of the particles within a substance. Temperature, on the other hand, is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those particles. 
* **Direct Relationship:**  More thermal energy means the particles are moving faster on average, which translates to a higher temperature.

Since the pies are identical except for their thermal energy, the one with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature.

butter melting on a hot day
peeling a banana
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Peeling a banana is a physical change. The peel is not covering the rest of the fruit anymore. But both the peel and the banana are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But peeling a banana is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Butter melting:** This is a change of state (solid to liquid) and doesn't alter the chemical composition of the butter. It's a physical change.
* **Peeling a banana:**  This is a separation process. You're simply removing the outer layer (peel) from the inner fruit. The chemical composition of the banana and peel remain the same. This is also a physical change. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve forming new substances with different properties. This doesn't happen in either scenario.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:**  Only the melting of butter is related to heating. Peeling a banana isn't.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  While melting is caused by heating, peeling a banana isn't.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size:** The strength of a magnet's field is directly related to its size. Larger magnets have a stronger magnetic field and exert a greater force.
* **Comparison:** In Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than in Pair 2. Since the other magnet (Magnet A) is the same size in both pairs, the larger Magnet B in Pair 2 will create a stronger magnetic force.

 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.
Apollo, a leopard from this group, has a spotted coat. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat and one allele for a black coat.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one allele for a black coat (a). So, Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa."	"The correct answer is **(1) Aa**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  A genotype refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a particular gene.
* **Alleles:** Alleles are different versions of a gene. In this case, the alleles are ""A"" for spotted coat and ""a"" for black coat.
* **Apollo's Traits:** We know Apollo has a spotted coat, meaning he must have at least one ""A"" allele.  We also know he has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one for a black coat (a).

Therefore, Apollo's genotype is **Aa**.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first sentence is the simple sentence. It is a single independent clause.
The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Simple Sentence:** A simple sentence has one independent clause (a complete thought). It has a subject and a verb and stands alone. 

* **The Package...Watch:**  This sentence has a subject (""package"") and a verb (""includes""). It's a complete thought, and it doesn't rely on any other clause to make sense.

* **Unless...Umbrella:** This sentence has two clauses.  ""Unless the weather forecast is wrong"" is a dependent clause (it cannot stand alone) and ""you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow"" is an independent clause.  This makes it a complex sentence.

baking an apple pie
cooking an egg
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes. The apples become soft, and the crust turns brown.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked eggs and raw eggs are made of different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Baking an apple pie:**  The heat of the oven causes the ingredients to change chemically. The sugar in the apples caramelizes, the flour in the crust browns, and the apples soften.
* **Cooking an egg:** The heat denatures the proteins in the egg, causing them to solidify and change texture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither process relies on cooling to achieve the desired result.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:**  Both baking an apple pie and cooking an egg involve chemical changes, as the composition of the ingredients is altered.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnet's magnetic field (and therefore its force) is directly related to its size.  Larger magnets generally have stronger magnetic fields.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** In both pairs, the ""C-shaped"" magnets are the same size. However, the triangular magnet in Pair 2 is larger than the triangular magnet in Pair 1.
* **Greater Force:**  Since the larger magnet in Pair 2 will have a stronger magnetic field, the force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be greater.

 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two budgerigar parakeets.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with blue body feathers or green body feathers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for green body feathers, is dominant over the b allele, which is for blue body feathers.
Blue body feathers is the recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the recessive version of the body feather color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with blue body feathers must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
Green body feathers is the dominant allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the dominant version of the body feather color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with green body feathers must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with blue body feathers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green body feathers."	"The answer is **(1) 0:4**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Allele:** The green body feather allele (B) is dominant. This means that even if an offspring inherits one green allele and one blue allele (Bb), it will still have green feathers.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes (Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb) contain at least one ""B"" allele, making them all green. There are no offspring with the genotype ""bb"" (blue feathers).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bb (1) a dwarf body
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a normal-sized body, and the allele b is for a dwarf body.
Algernon, a rat from this group, has a dwarf body. Algernon has two alleles for a dwarf body.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Algernon has two alleles for a dwarf body (b). So, Algernon's genotype for the body size gene is bb."	"The answer is **(0) bb**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  This refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a particular gene.
* **Alleles:** Different versions of a gene. In this case, 'B' represents the normal-sized body allele, and 'b' represents the dwarf body allele.
* **Algernon's Phenotype:**  Algernon has a dwarf body, meaning he expresses the dwarf body trait.
* **Recessive Allele:** The 'b' allele is recessive, meaning it only shows its effect when two copies of it are present.

Since Algernon has a dwarf body, he must have two copies of the recessive 'b' allele. Therefore, his genotype is **bb**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Cassie.
 Hint: Cassie is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Cassie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Cassie with a force of 1,200N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Cassie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Cassie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Cassie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced Forces:**  The force of gravity pulling Cassie down (600 N) is smaller than the force of the seat pushing her up (1200 N). This means the forces are not equal and opposite, making them unbalanced.
* **Net Force:** Since the forces are unbalanced, there is a net force acting on Cassie.  The net force is the difference between the two forces (1200 N - 600 N = 600 N), and it's directed upwards.

**Important Note:**  The hint mentions that all other forces are balanced. This means we only need to consider the forces of gravity and the seat pushing up on Cassie to determine if there's a net force.

1529	1529	"Question: Based on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age. (1) It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles. (2) It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure. (3) It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.
 Hint: Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.
 Solution: Think about these details from the text:
Fossils can show how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Fossil evidence shows that beetles die out less often than any other animal.
Beetles' low extinction rate helps explain the large number of beetle species.
In order to show that beetles die out less often than other animals, scientists must have compared different animals' extinction rates. To do this, they would need to figure out how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Based on these clues, you can guess that fossil evidence let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct animals. This helped them figure out that beetles die out less often than other animals, which explains the huge number of beetle species."	"The answer is **(3) It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.**

Here's why:

* The text states that fossils helped scientists determine beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal. 
* To make this comparison, scientists would need to examine the number of extinct beetles relative to the number of extinct species from other animal groups. 

The other choices are incorrect:

* **(0)** The text does not mention anything about beetles only appearing after Earth's most recent ice age.
* **(1)**  While the text mentions beetles' diets, it doesn't focus on what animals ate beetles.
* **(2)**  The text discusses beetle wings, but not their comparison to ancient beetle wing structures.

 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Certain types of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria have long, thin structures called flagella. The flagella on these bacteria can spin. This motion propels the bacteria and allows them to move through their environments.
Flagella are assembled from many different proteins that stick to each other. Parts of the E. coli flagella are made up of a protein called FliG. The FliG protein is encoded by the FliG gene.
Scientists discovered some E. coli cells that had no flagella. These bacteria had a mutation in the FliG gene. Compared to the FliG gene without a mutation, the mutated FliG gene encoded a form of the FliG protein with a different structure.
This different form of the FliG protein could not stick to other flagella proteins.

1546	1546	"Question: Which of the following organisms is the tertiary consumer in this food web?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black racer (1) silver maple (2) beaver (3) black bear
 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a secondary consumer, so the beaver is not a tertiary consumer.
The gray fox has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole. The pine vole is a secondary consumer, so the gray fox is a tertiary consumer.
The black racer has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole. The pine vole is a secondary consumer, so the black racer is a tertiary consumer.
The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the persimmon tree, the swallowtail caterpillar, and the beaver. None of these organisms is a secondary consumer, so the black bear is not a tertiary consumer.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not a tertiary consumer."	"The answer is **(0) black racer**. 

Here's why:

* **Tertiary consumers** are animals that eat secondary consumers. 
* In the food web, the black racer eats the pine vole, which is a secondary consumer (it eats the primary consumer, the swallowtail caterpillar).

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(1) Silver maple:** This is a producer, meaning it makes its own food through photosynthesis. It's not a consumer at all.
* **(2) Beaver:** This is a primary consumer, eating the silver maple, a producer. 
* **(3) Black bear:** The black bear is an omnivore, meaning it eats both plants and animals. It eats the persimmon tree (producer), the swallowtail caterpillar (primary consumer), and the beaver (primary consumer). It doesn't directly eat a secondary consumer, so it's not a tertiary consumer.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an allusion, a brief reference to someone or something well known.
Neverland alludes to the story of Peter Pan, a boy who lived in Neverland and never grew up."	"The correct answer is **(0) allusion**. 

Here's why:

* **Allusion:** A brief and indirect reference to a person, place, thing, or event, real or fictional. In this case, ""Neverland"" directly references the fictional island from the story of Peter Pan, where children never grow up.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 70°F (1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 75°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75°F bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 70°F bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 75°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total energy of the molecules within an object due to their motion.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those molecules.

Since both bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperatures, the bowl with the higher temperature (75°F) has a higher average kinetic energy of its molecules. This means it has more thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea (1) false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Neil must not care about democracy, because he didn't vote in the election. However, there may be a number of reasons why Neil didn't vote in the election. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."	"The correct answer is **(1) false dichotomy**. 

Here's why:

* **False Dichotomy:** This fallacy presents a situation as having only two options when, in reality, there are more. The argument assumes that the only two possibilities are either voting or having no regard for democracy.  This ignores other potential reasons why someone might not vote, such as:
    * Illness or disability
    * Disillusionment with the political system
    * Belief that their vote won't make a difference

 Solution: The source of the allusion Faustian bargain is literature.
In a play by Christopher Marlowe based on the legend of Faust, a man strikes a deal with the devil. Disregarding the long-term consequences of his actions, he sells his soul in exchange for power.
The allusion Faustian bargain means a compromise of one's values for personal gain."	"The correct answer is **(0) literature**. 

Here's why:

* **Faustian bargain** is an allusion to the German legend of **Johann Georg Faust**, a scholar who makes a pact with the devil (often depicted as Mephistopheles) in exchange for knowledge and power. This story was popularized in the play *Doctor Faustus* by Christopher Marlowe.

* **The allusion** in the sentence implies that Ariel made a deal with someone or something that is potentially dangerous or harmful, similar to Faust's pact with the devil.

milk going sour
deep-frying chicken
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Milk going sour:** This is a chemical change because the composition of the milk changes. Bacteria break down lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid, which gives the milk its sour taste and smell.
* **Deep-frying chicken:** This is also a chemical change. The heat from the oil causes the proteins in the chicken to denature and change their structure, resulting in cooked chicken with a different texture and flavor.

**Let's eliminate the other options:**

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  Incorrect.  Both changes involve the formation of new substances.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:** Incorrect. Milk going sour happens at room temperature or warmer, and deep-frying involves high heat.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** Incorrect. While deep-frying is caused by heating, milk going sour is caused by bacterial action.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The supply probably went up. (1) The supply probably went down.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."	"The answer is **(1) The supply probably went down.** 

Here's why:

* **Fewer Stores = Less Supply:**  When the number of stores selling men's shirts decreases, there are fewer places for consumers to buy them. This directly impacts the overall supply of men's shirts in the area.
* **Supply and Demand:**  The supply of a product is a key factor in determining its price.  With fewer stores, there's a higher chance that the supply of men's shirts couldn't keep up with demand, leading to potential shortages or higher prices.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) solid coloring (1) white spots
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Winnee is a cow from this group. Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Solution: Winnee's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Winnee's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for white spots. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.
To check this answer, consider whether Winnee's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Winnee's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots."	"The correct answer is **(1) white spots**.

* **Recessive Allele:** The information states that the allele for white spots (a) is recessive. This means that an individual needs two copies of the 'a' allele to express the white spot phenotype.
* **Winnee's Genotype:** Winnee has the homozygous genotype 'aa', meaning she has two copies of the recessive 'a' allele.
* **Phenotype Expression:** Since Winnee has two copies of the recessive 'a' allele, she will express the white spots phenotype.

 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces. But each piece is still made of paper.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

In business, we should consider competition not a threat but a challenge.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chiasmus (1) antithesis
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses antithesis, the contrasting of opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure.
The sentence contrasts two ways of looking at competition, as a threat and a challenge."	"The answer is **(1) antithesis**. 

Here's why:

* **Antithesis** is a rhetorical device that uses contrasting ideas in a balanced grammatical structure. In this sentence, ""threat"" and ""challenge"" are direct opposites, and they are placed in parallel grammatical structures (""not a threat but a challenge""). 

* **Chiasmus** is a figure of speech where the grammatical structure of the second phrase is a reversal of the first.  While there is a reversal of meaning in the sentence (""threat"" vs. ""challenge""), the grammatical structure doesn't completely reverse. 

Therefore, **antithesis** is the most accurate figure of speech used in the given text.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Force vs. Direction:** While the magnets in Pair 1 attract and those in Pair 2 repel, this only affects the direction of the magnetic force. The strength of the force remains the same.
* **Factors Affecting Force:** The magnitude of the magnetic force depends on:
    * **Strength of the magnets:** Both pairs have magnets made of the same material, so their strength is the same.
    * **Distance between magnets:** The magnets in both pairs are separated by the same distance (0.5 inches).
    * **Size of the magnets:** The magnets in both pairs have the same size.

Since all these factors are identical in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change."	"The answer is **(1) chemical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A physical change alters the form or appearance of a substance but doesn't change its chemical composition. Examples include melting ice, cutting paper, or dissolving sugar in water.
* **Chemical Change:** A chemical change results in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties. This usually involves breaking and forming new chemical bonds.

When you polish a tarnished silver spoon, you're not just removing a layer of dirt. You're actually reacting the tarnish (silver sulfide) with the polish to create a new compound that can be wiped away. This is a chemical change because the composition of the tarnished silver has been altered.

Mud drying out in the sun is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Mud drying out in the sun is a physical change. The sun heats the water in the mud. The water changes state. It evaporates and becomes gas in the air.
Dry dirt is left behind. But the dirt and the water are still made of the same types of matter as before."	"The answer is **(0) physical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition.  
* **Chemical Change:** A change where a new substance is formed with different chemical properties.

In this case, the mud is simply losing water through evaporation. The water changes state (liquid to gas), but the mud itself (the dirt particles) remains the same.  No new substances are formed.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
Arrows point to the mushroom from the grizzly bear and the barren-ground caribou. The only arrows pointing to the grizzly bear start from the barren-ground caribou and the bilberry. The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the lichen or the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the mushroom.
Arrows point to the grizzly bear from the bilberry and the barren-ground caribou. The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. No arrow points to the lichen or the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the grizzly bear."	"The answer is **(1) earthworm**. Here's why:

* **Earthworm:**  The food web shows that the earthworm eats the bear sedge. This means the earthworm's body contains matter that was once part of the bear sedge.
* **Grizzly Bear:** The grizzly bear eats the barren-ground caribou and bilberry. The barren-ground caribou eats lichen, and there's no direct connection between lichen and the bear sedge. The bilberry doesn't eat the bear sedge either. 
* **Mushroom:** The mushroom eats the barren-ground caribou. The barren-ground caribou eats lichen, and there's no direct connection between lichen and the bear sedge. 

Therefore, only the earthworm's body contains matter that was once part of the bear sedge.

 Choices: (0) metaphor (1) simile
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Jayla went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.
The words Jayla and penguin are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."	"The correct answer is **(1) simile**. 

Here's why:

* **Simile:** A simile uses the words ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two things. 
* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly states that one thing is another thing, without using ""like"" or ""as"".

The sentence ""Jayla went down the slide face-first, **like** a penguin"" uses the word ""like"" to compare Jayla's action to a penguin.  Therefore, it's a simile.

 Solution: Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 440 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"You're absolutely right! Here's a breakdown of why the solution is correct:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time.**  (Speed = Distance / Time)
* **All motorboats traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours).**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) AA (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a black coat, and the allele a is for a spotted coat.
Freya, a jaguar from this group, has a black coat. Freya has two alleles for a black coat.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Freya's observable version of the coat pattern trait is a black coat. So, Freya's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical expression of a trait. 
* Freya has a black coat, which is the observable characteristic of the coat pattern trait. 
* While we know her genotype (the specific alleles she carries) is AA, the question asks for her phenotype. 

Therefore, Freya's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is **a black coat**.

1638	1638	"Question: Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the body color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gray body (1) a black body
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype BB for the body color gene.
 Solution: The fruit fly's genotype for the body color gene is BB. The fruit fly's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a gray body. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body.
To check this answer, consider whether the fruit fly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body."	"The correct answer is **(0) a gray body**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The fly has the genotype BB, meaning it has two copies of the dominant ""B"" allele.
* **Dominant Allele:** The ""B"" allele is dominant, meaning it will express its trait even if there's only one copy present.
* **Phenotype:**  Since the fly has two ""B"" alleles, it will express the dominant trait, which is a gray body.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction so.
Ashley dislikes radishes, so she always orders her salad without them."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Compound Sentence:** A compound sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like *and*, *but*, *or*, *so*, *for*, *yet*, *nor*). 

* **Independent Clause:** An independent clause is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete sentence.

**Let's break down the sentences:**

* **(0) Ashley dislikes radishes, so she always orders her salad without them.**  This is a compound sentence.  
    *  ""Ashley dislikes radishes"" is an independent clause.
    * ""She always orders her salad without them"" is another independent clause.
    * They are joined by the coordinating conjunction ""so"".

* **(1) Before Rebecca's birthday party, Juan wrapped her present with delicate silver tissue paper.** This is a complex sentence. It has one independent clause (""Juan wrapped her present with delicate silver tissue paper"") and one dependent clause (""Before Rebecca's birthday party"").

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size:**  The strength of a magnetic field, and therefore the magnetic force, is related to the size of the magnet. Larger magnets have stronger fields.
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:** In Pair 1, the magnet on the right is larger than the magnet on the left. In Pair 2, the magnet on the right is smaller than the magnet on the left. 
* **Force Strength:** Since the magnet on the right is smaller in Pair 2, the overall magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is (2). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force Factors:** The strength of the magnetic force depends on:
    * **Strength of the magnets:** Both pairs use the same material, so the magnets have the same strength.
    * **Distance between magnets:** Both pairs have the same distance (12.1 mm).
    * **Orientation of the magnets:** While this affects the direction of the force (attraction or repulsion), it doesn't change the magnitude.

* **Conclusion:** Since the relevant factors are identical in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) During the game, the children hid behind the large tree. (1) We went to Texas, we saw an old fort.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: We went to Texas, we saw an old fort is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined by just a comma: We went to Texas and We saw an old fort."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Choice (1) ""We went to Texas, we saw an old fort"" is the run-on sentence.**

Here's why:

* **Run-on sentences** occur when two or more complete sentences are joined without proper punctuation or conjunctions.
* **Choice (1)** has two independent clauses (""We went to Texas"" and ""we saw an old fort"") separated only by a comma. This is incorrect grammar.

**To fix the run-on sentence, you could:**

* **Use a period:** We went to Texas. We saw an old fort.
* **Use a semicolon:** We went to Texas; we saw an old fort.
* **Use a coordinating conjunction (and, but, or, so, yet, for):** We went to Texas, and we saw an old fort. 

**Choice (0) ""During the game, the children hid behind the large tree"" is a complete sentence.** The phrase ""During the game"" acts as an introductory phrase modifying the main clause ""the children hid behind the large tree"".

 Choices: (0) green body feathers (1) blue body feathers
 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
Tiki is a budgerigar parakeet from this group. Tiki has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene.
 Solution: Tiki's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb. Tiki's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for blue body feathers. So, Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.
To check this answer, consider whether Tiki's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Tiki's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers."	"The answer is **(1) blue body feathers**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive. This means it only expresses itself if two copies of the 'b' allele are present (bb genotype).

 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The swallowtail caterpillar has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree. The persimmon tree is not a primary consumer, so the swallowtail caterpillar is not a secondary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a primary consumer, so the beaver is not a secondary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a secondary consumer.
The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver. The swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver are primary consumers, so the black bear is a secondary consumer.
The bobcat has an arrow pointing to it from the beaver. The beaver is a primary consumer, so the bobcat is a secondary consumer."	"The answer is **(1) black bear**.

 Choices: (0) an 8-kilogram block of iron at a temperature of 70°F (1) an 8-kilogram block of iron at a temperature of 95°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two blocks of iron have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 95°F block is hotter than the 70°F block, it has more thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) an 8-kilogram block of iron at a temperature of 95°F**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of an object due to the random motion of its molecules. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these molecules. 

The hotter an object is, the faster its molecules are moving, and therefore the more thermal energy it has.  Since both blocks of iron are the same size, the one at the higher temperature (95°F) will have more thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter block of steel (1) the colder block of steel
 Hint: Two 4-kilogram blocks of steel are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two blocks of steel are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder block of steel has less thermal energy."	"The answer is **(1) the colder block of steel**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of a system due to its temperature.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance.
* The hotter block has particles moving faster and therefore has a higher average kinetic energy, meaning it has more thermal energy. 
* The colder block has particles moving slower and therefore has a lower average kinetic energy, meaning it has less thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Pablo will get to look at the birch tree. He thinks it will look more beautiful than the hydrangeas would have looked. (1) The birch tree will use up more space than the hydrangeas would have used up.
 Hint: Pablo is deciding whether to plant hydrangeas or a birch tree in his backyard. He wants to make his backyard more beautiful. But he also wants to leave space for doing fun things.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Pablo wants or needs:
The birch tree will use up more space than the hydrangeas would have used up."	"You are absolutely correct! The correct answer is **(1) The birch tree will use up more space than the hydrangeas would have used up.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:**  A cost in economics is something you give up or spend to get something else.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** In this case, Pablo is facing an *opportunity cost*. By choosing the birch tree, he is giving up the opportunity to have more space for other activities.  

Let's break down why the other option isn't a cost:

* **(0) Pablo will get to look at the birch tree. He thinks it will look more beautiful than the hydrangeas would have looked.** This is a benefit. Pablo gains something he values (a beautiful tree) by choosing the birch tree. 

**Key takeaway:** When analyzing costs, think about what you are giving up by making a choice. In this case, the space for other activities is the cost associated with choosing the birch tree.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Scheherazade is ancient legend.
The Arabian Nights presents the ancient legend of how Scheherazade successfully postpones her imminent death by mesmerizing her captor with a thousand and one fascinating tales.
The allusion Scheherazade means a person who uses his or her arts to distract someone and avoid consequences."	"The correct answer is **(0) ancient legend**.

Lindsey's Boutique claims to have ""something for everyone,"" but it is generally understood that their target market is women of a certain age.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) euphemism (1) paradox
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
Of a certain age is an indirect and generally more polite way of referring to older people."	"The correct answer is **(0) euphemism**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. In this case, ""of a certain age"" is a euphemism for ""older"". 
* **Paradox:** A paradox is a statement that seems contradictory or absurd but may contain a truth. The text doesn't present a contradictory statement.

The text uses ""of a certain age"" to avoid directly stating that Lindsey's Boutique caters to older women. This makes the statement more polite and less potentially offensive.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is the complex sentence. It is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause begins with the subordinating conjunction when.
Peter was playing the piano in the living room when Dad called him for dinner."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Complex Sentence:** A complex sentence contains one independent clause (a complete thought) and at least one dependent clause (a thought that cannot stand alone). The dependent clause is usually introduced by a subordinating conjunction like ""when"", ""because"", ""although"", etc.

Let's break down the sentences:

* **(0) Peter was playing the piano in the living room when Dad called him for dinner.**  This sentence has two clauses:
    * **Independent:** Peter was playing the piano in the living room.
    * **Dependent:** when Dad called him for dinner.
    * **Subordinating conjunction:**  ""when""

* **(1) The audition for the part of Dracula will begin in just a few minutes.** This sentence has only one independent clause. There's no dependent clause or subordinating conjunction.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases. 
* **Pair Comparison:** Pair 2 has a greater distance (4.5 cm) between the magnets compared to Pair 1 (2.85 cm).
* **Force Strength:**  Since the distance is greater in Pair 2, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker.

A shopping bag holding 9 pounds of food is heavier than a shopping bag holding 7 pounds of food. So, the bag holding 9 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other bag."	"The answer is **(0) a bag holding 9 pounds of food**. 

Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  The force needed to lift an object is directly related to its weight. Heavier objects require more force to lift.
* **Constant Speed:**  Even though the shopper lifts both bags at the same speed, the heavier bag still requires more force to overcome its greater weight.

The solution correctly explains that the bag holding 9 pounds is heavier and therefore requires a larger force to lift.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Size:** The strength of a magnet's field, and therefore the magnetic force it exerts, is directly related to its size. Larger magnets have stronger magnetic fields.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** In Pair 1, the magnet on the right (Magnet B) is smaller than the magnet on the right in Pair 2. Since Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, the smaller size of Magnet B in Pair 1 means the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself (2) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Emily Campbell can't understand rural, blue-collar workers because she is associated with an urban newspaper. However, where Emily works doesn't necessarily indicate anything about her ability to empathize. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* The argument attempts to discredit Emily Campbell's understanding of rural, blue-collar workers solely based on her husband's profession. It assumes that because her husband is an investment banker, she must be out of touch with their struggles. This is an example of guilt by association, where a person is judged based on the actions or affiliations of someone else. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) circular reasoning:** This involves using the claim itself as evidence, creating a circular argument. The text doesn't do that.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that as the magnets get closer, the force becomes much stronger.

* **Comparing the Pairs:**
    * Pair 1 has a distance of 2 inches between the magnets.
    * Pair 2 has a distance of 5 inches between the magnets.

* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be significantly stronger than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2.

The second text uses travesty in its nontraditional sense: a disappointment or a tragedy.
Kristen thought it a travesty that her local news network provided only limited coverage of the presidential debates.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word travesty because it is considered more standard."	"You're absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) Kristen was upset about the local news network's coverage of the presidential debates, calling it a travesty of reporting that undermined important issues.** 

Here's why:

* **Travesty in its traditional sense:**  Means a distorted or grossly exaggerated imitation of something, often with the intention of making it appear ridiculous. This is how the word is used in choice (1). The coverage is being described as a distorted, poor imitation of proper reporting.

* **Travesty in a non-traditional sense:**  Can be used to mean something that is a complete failure or a sad mockery of something else. While this sense is common, it's less precise and often used to express strong emotional reaction. This is how it's used in choice (0).

Kyle has a scar on his right hand.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) inherited (1) acquired
 Hint: Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.
 Solution: Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait."	"The answer is **(1) acquired**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. 
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences.

Kyle's scar is a result of an injury, which is an environmental factor.  Therefore, it is an acquired trait.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One duck moved 755 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other duck moved 970 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each duck spent the same amount of time moving. The duck that moved 755 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at a lower speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) a duck that moved 755 kilometers in 10 hours**. 

Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time.** 
* Both ducks traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours).
* The duck that traveled 755 kilometers covered a shorter distance than the duck that traveled 970 kilometers.
*  Since they traveled for the same time, the duck that covered a shorter distance must have been moving at a lower speed.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it could refer to the sedan or Bluetooth.
After scouring the classified ads for days, Dave finally found a used car that fit his budget. The sedan had Bluetooth, but it needed to be fixed.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
After scouring the classified ads for days, Dave finally found a used car that fit his budget. The sedan needed to be fixed, but it had Bluetooth."	"You are absolutely correct! The second answer choice has a vague pronoun reference. Here's why:

* **The Pronoun:** The pronoun ""it"" is used in the sentence ""The sedan had Bluetooth, but it needed to be fixed.""
* **The Ambiguity:** The pronoun ""it"" could refer to either the ""sedan"" or the ""Bluetooth"". It's unclear which one needs to be fixed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Senator Pena hates children, because she wants to cut education funding. However, the fact that Senator Pena wants to cut education funding doesn't necessarily suggest that she hates children. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."	"The correct answer is **(0) straw man**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument misrepresents Senator Pena's position.** The text assumes that cutting funding for early childhood education programs is equivalent to hating children. This is a misrepresentation, as there could be many reasons for supporting such a decision, such as budget constraints or differing priorities.
* **It sets up a false dichotomy.** The statement implies that the only options are ""loving children"" or ""hating children,"" ignoring the possibility of other motivations and factors involved in the decision.

This tactic makes it easier to attack Senator Pena's position without addressing the real reasons behind it.

 Choices: (0) Manny will give up the chance to look at the oak tree. He thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the amaryllises. (1) He will save some space. The amaryllises will use up less space than the oak tree would have used up.
 Hint: Manny is deciding whether to plant amaryllises or an oak tree in his backyard. He wants to make his backyard more beautiful. But he also wants to leave space for doing fun things.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Manny wants or needs:
Manny will give up the chance to look at the oak tree. He thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the amaryllises."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Cost vs. Benefit:**  The concept of cost in economics is about what you *give up* when making a choice. 
* **Manny's Choice:** Manny is choosing between two options: an oak tree or amaryllises. By choosing the amaryllises, he's giving up the opportunity to have the oak tree. 
* **The Cost:** The cost of planting amaryllises is the loss of the beautiful oak tree.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) apostrophe (1) euphemism
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
Downsizing is an indirect way of saying that the company is planning on firing employees, closing shops or branches, and/or reducing its budget."	"The correct answer is **(1) euphemism**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt.  ""Downsizing"" is a euphemism for ""laying off employees"" or ""closing stores.""

* **Apostrophe:** An apostrophe is a figure of speech in which a speaker directly addresses someone or something that is absent or inanimate. This is not present in the text. 

The text uses ""downsizing"" to soften the impact of the news that the company is making changes that could affect employees or store locations.

 Solution: Read the text carefully.
Karen lives in a windy place.
This passage tells you about the usual amount of wind where Karen lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"The correct answer is **(1) climate**. 

Here's why:

* **Weather** refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place (e.g., sunny and warm, rainy and cold). 
* **Climate** describes the long-term weather patterns of a region, including average temperatures, rainfall, and wind patterns.

The passage states that Karen lives in a ""windy place,"" indicating a characteristic of the long-term weather patterns in her area, which aligns with the definition of climate.

"The correct answer is **(3) Yes, because it fails to use quotation marks and fails to cite the source.**

Here's why:

* **Plagiarism:** The student text directly copies a phrase from the source (""the bilingual brain's ability to inhibit one language while using another"") without using quotation marks to indicate that it is a direct quote. This constitutes plagiarism.

 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:**  The kinetic energy (KE) of a particle is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle

* **Comparing the Samples:** The diagrams show that the particles in sample B have a higher average speed (580 m/s) than the particles in sample A (560 m/s). Since the particles in both samples have the same mass, the particles in sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy, and therefore a higher temperature.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic force and distance:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the pairs:**  Pair 2 has a greater distance (5.7 mm) between the magnets compared to Pair 1 (3.8 mm). 
* **Conclusion:** Because of the greater distance in Pair 2, the magnetic force between the magnets will be weaker.

Vinegar is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour vinegar into a different container, the vinegar will take the shape of that container. But the vinegar will still take up the same amount of space.
A scarf is a solid. You can fold a scarf. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.
The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space."	"The correct answer is **(2) scarf**. Here's why:

1802	1802	"Question: Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = (1/2) * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle

Since the particles in sample A have a higher average speed, they have a higher average kinetic energy.  Therefore, sample A has the higher temperature.

The baby red salamanders live underwater. (1) Great blue herons have two wings with bluish-gray feathers. Their eggs also have bluish shells. Great blue herons use their beaks to catch and eat small fish, crabs, and other small animals.
 Hint: Amphibians are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify amphibians:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
They have moist skin.
They make eggs with no shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions.
 Solution: To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Amphibians have the following traits:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
They have moist skin.
They make eggs with no shells.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.

A red salamander has the following traits:
It spends part of its life in water and part on land.
It has moist skin.
It makes eggs with no shells.
A red salamander has the traits of an amphibian. A red salamander is an amphibian."	"The answer is **(0) Red salamanders**. 

Here's why:

* **Red salamanders**  match all the criteria of amphibians:
    * **Spend part of their lives in water and part on land:**  They live near rivers and ponds but lay eggs underwater.
    * **Have moist skin:**  They breathe through their skin.

How could Hazel have anything insightful to say about foreign affairs? She grew up on a farm.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations (1) ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself (2) slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Hazel cannot be insightful about foreign affairs because she grew up on a farm. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to whether she knows about foreign affairs. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."	"The correct answer is **(1) ad hominem**. 

Here's why:

* **Ad hominem** attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. In this case, the argument is that Hazel can't have insightful opinions on foreign affairs because she grew up on a farm. This is irrelevant to her actual knowledge or understanding of foreign affairs.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

* **Hasty generalization:** This fallacy involves drawing a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence. The text doesn't make a generalization about all farmers, so this doesn't apply.
* **Slippery slope fallacy:** This fallacy claims that one event will inevitably lead to a chain of negative consequences. The text doesn't suggest that Hazel's upbringing will cause a series of problems related to her foreign affairs knowledge.

 Solution: The best estimate for the length of a caterpillar is 17 millimeters.
17 centimeters, 17 meters, and 17 kilometers are all too long."	"You are absolutely right! The answer is **(3) 17 millimeters**. 

Here's why:

* **17 millimeters** is a very reasonable size for a typical caterpillar.
* **17 centimeters** would be about the size of a small adult hand, which is too large.
* **17 meters** is about the length of a school bus, way too big for a caterpillar!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) beaver (1) black bear (2) persimmon tree (3) gray fox
 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The gray fox has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole. The pine vole is a secondary consumer, so the gray fox is a tertiary consumer.
The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the persimmon tree, the swallowtail caterpillar, and the beaver. None of these organisms is a secondary consumer, so the black bear is not a tertiary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a secondary consumer, so the beaver is not a tertiary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a tertiary consumer.
The black racer has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole. The pine vole is a secondary consumer, so the black racer is a tertiary consumer."	The answer is (3).	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Dolostone has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
naturally occurring
solid
light gray
made mostly of dolomite
not made by organisms
 Solution: The properties of dolostone match the properties of a rock. So, dolostone is a rock."	"The answer is **(0) rock**. 

Here's why:

* **Minerals** are naturally occurring, solid substances with a defined chemical composition and a specific crystal structure.
* **Rocks** are made up of one or more minerals. They don't have a fixed chemical composition or a crystal structure.

Dolostone fits the description of a rock because it is made up primarily of the mineral dolomite, but it doesn't have a fixed crystal structure.

Chanel, a cat from this group, has a hairless body. Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Chanel's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body. So, Chanel's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body."	"The correct answer is **(0) a hairless body**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genotype (the combination of alleles).
* We are told Chanel has a hairless body. This is the observable trait, making it her phenotype.
* The information about the alleles (B for hairy, b for hairless) and her having two ""b"" alleles is relevant to her genotype, but the question asks specifically for her phenotype.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Mr. Harding can quit smoking because he is able to stop. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."	"The correct answer is **(0) circular reasoning**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument relies on the claim itself to justify the claim.**  It says Mr. Harding can quit because he's capable of stopping. This doesn't offer any independent reason why he could quit, it simply restates the conclusion. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) slippery slope fallacy:** This fallacy assumes a chain reaction of negative consequences from a single action. The text doesn't make that kind of assumption.

An Amazon milk frog does not have all of the traits of a fish. An Amazon milk frog is an amphibian.
A thresher shark has the following traits:
It has fins, not limbs.
It makes eggs with no shells.
A thresher shark has the traits of a fish. A thresher shark is a fish."	"The answer is **(0) Thresher sharks**. 

Here's why:

* **Fish Traits:** The passage states that fish have fins and lay eggs without shells.
* **Thresher Shark Traits:** The description of the thresher shark states it has fins and lays eggs with no shells. 
* **Amazon Milk Frog Traits:** The description of the Amazon milk frog states it has moist skin, lives in water and on land, and lays eggs without shells. While it lays eggs without shells, it doesn't have fins, making it an amphibian, not a fish. 

Therefore, the thresher shark is the only animal described that possesses all the traits of a fish.

The Monongahela National Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in eastern West Virginia.
 Solution: A temperate deciduous forest is a type of ecosystem. Temperate deciduous forests have the following features: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. So, the Monongahela National Forest has cold, wet winters. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients."	"The answer is **(1) It has cold, wet winters. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients.** 

Here's why:

* **Temperate Deciduous Forests:** The Monongahela National Forest is a temperate deciduous forest. These forests are known for their rich, fertile soil and distinct seasons, including cold, wet winters. 
* **Nutrient-Rich Soil:** The decomposition of leaves and other organic matter in deciduous forests creates a thick layer of nutrient-rich soil.
* **Variety of Trees:** While the statement mentions ""only a few types of trees,"" temperate deciduous forests actually have a diverse mix of trees, such as oak, maple, and hickory.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three glasses of apple juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 66°F glass of apple juice is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."	"The answer is **(2) a 225-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 66°F**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance.**
* **Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.**

Therefore, the higher the temperature, the greater the average kinetic energy of the particles, and the higher the thermal energy.

Here's a breakdown:

* **Choice 1: ""The fleece jacket that Sophia saw on the bench looked like Kate's.""**  This is clear and unambiguous.  We know ""Kate's"" refers to Kate's jacket.

* **Choice 2: ""Sophia told Kate that the fleece jacket on the bench looked like hers.""** This is where the ambiguity lies.  The pronoun ""hers"" could refer to either Sophia's jacket or Kate's jacket.  Without more context, we can't be sure.

**To fix the vague pronoun reference in Choice 2, you could rewrite it as:**

* ""Sophia told Kate that the fleece jacket on the bench looked like *her* jacket."" (This makes it clear that it's Kate's jacket being compared.)

Scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the phrase, but many claim that Job is saying that he narrowly escaped death.
The allusion by the skin of his teeth means just barely."	"The answer is **(0) the Bible**. 

You are absolutely correct! The phrase ""by the skin of his teeth"" originates from the Book of Job in the Bible.  Job, facing extreme hardship, says, ""My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."" This has come to mean a very narrow escape, almost by luck or a miracle.

Red velvet cupcakes were Krysta's Achilles's heel when she was trying to eat more healthily.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Greek mythology (1) the Bible
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Achilles's heel is Greek mythology.
In Greek mythology, Achilles's mother dips him in a river that protects his body wherever it touches. His heel does not get wet, so it is the one part of his body left unprotected. During the Trojan War, an arrow hits Achilles in the heel and kills him.
The allusion Achilles's heel means a sole weakness."	"The answer is **(0) Greek mythology**. 

You're absolutely right! The phrase ""Achilles' heel"" comes from the Greek myth of Achilles. His mother dipped him in the River Styx to make him invincible, but she held him by his heel, which was the only part of his body that didn't touch the water.  This made his heel his one vulnerable spot, and it's why the phrase ""Achilles' heel"" represents a weakness that can lead to downfall.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) opaque (1) fragile (2) transparent
 Hint: Select the best answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
An opaque object does not let light through. The ceramic tea cup is opaque, but the window, the glass, and the icicle are not.
A fragile object will break into pieces if you drop it. All four objects are fragile.
You can see clearly through a transparent object. The window and the glass are transparent, but the ceramic tea cup is not.
The property that all four objects have in common is fragile."	"The answer is **(1) fragile**. 

Here's why:

* **Opaque:**  A window, glass, and an icicle are all transparent, allowing light to pass through. Only the ceramic tea cup is opaque.
* **Fragile:** All four objects (window, glass, icicle, and ceramic tea cup) are prone to breaking if dropped. 
* **Transparent:**  Only the window and the glass are transparent. The ceramic tea cup and icicle are not. 

Since all four objects are fragile, that's the property they have in common.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1 cup (1) 1 fluid ounce (2) 1 gallon
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the volume of a small can of tomato sauce is 1 cup.
1 fluid ounce is too little and 1 gallon is too much."	"The solution and hint are correct. Here's why:

* **1 fluid ounce:** This is a very small amount, about the size of a shot glass. It wouldn't be enough for a single serving of tomato sauce.
* **1 gallon:**  This is a very large amount, equivalent to 16 cups.  It would be an extremely large can of tomato sauce. 
* **1 cup:** This is the most reasonable estimate for a small can of tomato sauce. It's a common serving size and fits the typical size of a small can. 

Therefore, **(0) 1 cup** is the best estimate.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the cup of black tea with more thermal energy (1) the cup of black tea with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two 250-gram cups of black tea are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two cups of black tea are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."	"The answer is **(1) the cup of black tea with less thermal energy**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:** Thermal energy is the total energy of the molecules in a substance. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those molecules. 
* **Relationship:** More thermal energy means the molecules are moving faster, leading to a higher temperature.  Less thermal energy means the molecules are moving slower, resulting in a lower temperature.

Since the cups are identical in all other ways (mass, material), the only difference is the thermal energy.  The cup with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature.

1841	1841	"Question: Based on this information, what is Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having horns (1) not having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Zelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Zelda's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Zelda's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"The answer is **(1) not having horns**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Zelda's genotype is Hh, meaning she has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h).
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant. This means that if an organism has at least one 'H' allele, it will not have horns.
* **Phenotype:** Since Zelda has the 'H' allele, her phenotype (physical expression) for the horns trait is not having horns.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Closer Magnets:**  Pair 2 has a smaller distance (6.9 mm) between the magnets compared to Pair 1 (12.5 mm).
* **Greater Force:** Because the magnets in Pair 2 are closer, the magnetic force between them will be stronger. 

The fact that one pair repels and the other attracts only affects the direction of the force, not its magnitude.

A slice of banana turning brown is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chemical change (1) physical change
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter."	"The correct answer is **(0) chemical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Chemical Change:**  Involves the formation of new substances with different properties. The browning of a banana is a result of a chemical reaction called oxidation.  The banana's components react with oxygen in the air, changing its chemical composition and producing a new substance (the brown color).

* **Physical Change:**  Alters the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical composition. Examples include melting ice (water changes state but remains H₂O), cutting paper (it's still paper, just smaller), or crushing a rock (still the same rock, just broken up).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Aequorea victoria (1) Goura scheepmakeri (2) Strix aluco
 Hint: This organism is a Victoria crowned pigeon. Its scientific name is Goura victoria.
 Solution: A Victoria crowned pigeon's scientific name is Goura victoria. The first word of its scientific name is Goura.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Goura victoria are not in the same genus.
Goura scheepmakeri is in the genus Goura. The first word of its scientific name is Goura. So, Goura scheepmakeri and Goura victoria are in the same genus.
Aequorea victoria and Goura victoria are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Aequorea victoria and Goura victoria have the same species name within their genus, victoria. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Aequorea victoria is in the genus Aequorea, and Goura victoria is in the genus Goura."	"The answer is **(1) Goura scheepmakeri**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:** Organisms are classified using a two-part scientific name called binomial nomenclature. The first part is the genus, and the second part is the species.
* **Genus:** The Victoria crowned pigeon's scientific name is *Goura victoria*. This means it belongs to the genus *Goura*.
* **Matching Genus:**  The choice *Goura scheepmakeri* also starts with the genus name *Goura*, indicating it's in the same genus as the Victoria crowned pigeon.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	The answer is (1).	natural science
1874	1874	"Question: Select the solid.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) air inside a soccer ball (1) water droplets (2) robot (3) helium
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The air inside a soccer ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air fills all the space inside the soccer ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.
Water droplets are a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you collect water droplets in a bucket, they will take the shape of the bucket. But the water droplets will still take up the same amount of space.
A robot is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A robot can move. But if it moves across a room, the robot will still have a size and shape of its own.
Helium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon."	"The correct answer is **(2) robot**. 

Here's why:

* **Solids** have a definite shape and volume. They don't change their shape easily, even when moved. A robot, despite being able to move, maintains its overall shape and size.

Let's look at the other choices:

* **(0) air inside a soccer ball:** Air is a gas. Gases take the shape of their container and can be compressed.
* **(1) water droplets:** Water droplets are liquid. Liquids take the shape of their container but have a fixed volume.
* **(3) helium:** Helium is a gas. Like air, it expands to fill a container.

After a jog around the block, Sadie collapsed on the couch and declared with a wheeze, ""Well, I'm ready to run a marathon.""
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Sadie was out of shape. (1) Sadie plans to run more.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Ready to run a marathon ironically suggests that Sadie was out of shape. She was actually far from ready to run a marathon."	"The correct answer is **(0) Sadie was out of shape.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that contradicts the actual meaning, often to create humor or emphasize a point. 
* Sadie's statement ""Well, I'm ready to run a marathon"" is ironic because she is clearly exhausted after a short jog. This implies that she is not in good physical condition and therefore far from ready to run a marathon. 

The choice **(1) Sadie plans to run more** is not supported by the text. While it's possible she might decide to run more in the future, the statement itself suggests the opposite.

* **Concentration** is about how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
* **Solution A** has 5 yellow particles in 20 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 2 yellow particles in 20 mL of solvent.

Since Solution A has more yellow particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
The grizzly bear has two arrows pointing to it. One arrow starts from the bilberry. The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. The other arrow pointing to the grizzly bear starts from the barren-ground caribou. The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the grizzly bear.
The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the bilberry.There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the short-tailed weasel: bear sedge->brown lemming->short-tailed weasel. There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the Arctic fox: bear sedge->brown lemming->Arctic fox.

Don't try to tell me that you only watch educational programming, Marie! I know for a fact that your sister only watches reality television.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Marie must watch reality television, because her sister watches reality television. However, even though Marie's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Marie does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is a fallacy where someone is judged or discredited based on their association with another person or group, even if they have no direct involvement or responsibility for the actions of that person or group. 

In this case, the speaker is attempting to discredit Marie's claim by associating her with her sister's viewing habits.  The speaker assumes that because Marie's sister watches reality TV, Marie must also do so, even though there's no evidence to support this claim.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The suitcase is pushing on Scott. (1) The suitcase is pulling on Scott.
 Hint: Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Scott is pulling on a full suitcase.
 Solution: Scott is pulling on the suitcase. So, Newton's third law tells you that the suitcase is pulling on Scott."	"The correct answer is **(1) The suitcase is pulling on Scott.**

Here's why:

* **Newton's Third Law:**  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always come in pairs.
* **The Action:** Scott is pulling on the suitcase (this is the action).
* **The Reaction:**  Therefore, the suitcase must be pulling back on Scott with an equal and opposite force (this is the reaction). 

The suitcase is not pushing on Scott, as pushing implies a force that is perpendicular to the surface of the suitcase. The force between Scott and the suitcase is a pulling force, which acts along the line connecting Scott and the suitcase.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnetic field, and therefore the magnetic force it exerts, is directly related to the size of the magnet. Larger magnets have stronger fields.
* **Comparing Pairs:** In Pair 1, the rectangular magnet (Magnet B) is larger than the rectangular magnet in Pair 2.  Both pairs have the same ring magnet (Magnet A).
* **Conclusion:**  Since the larger magnet in Pair 1 contributes to a stronger overall magnetic force, the magnitude of the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 will be greater than in Pair 2.

1930	1930	"Question: In this experiment, which were part of a control group?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the pots with pure water (1) the pots with salted water
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Hansen was a chef's assistant in an Italian restaurant. One of his coworkers told him that adding salt to water would cause the spaghetti to cook faster.
Hansen gathered six pots that were the same size. He filled each pot with the same amount of pure water. He added one tablespoon of salt to each of three pots. He did not add salt to the other three pots. Then, Hansen boiled spaghetti in each pot. He checked how firm the spaghetti was after five minutes of boiling.
Figure: spaghetti in a pot.
 Solution: In this experiment, Hansen investigated whether adding salt to water affects how quickly spaghetti cooks. The pots with pure water did not have salt. So, they were part of a control group."	"The answer is **(0) the pots with pure water**. 

Here's why:

* **Control Group:** A control group in an experiment is a group that does not receive the treatment (in this case, the salt).  It acts as a baseline for comparison.
* **Experimental Group:** The experimental group receives the treatment. In this case, the pots with salted water are the experimental group.

Hansen wanted to see if adding salt to the water made a difference in how fast the spaghetti cooked. To do this, he had to compare the cooking time of spaghetti in plain water (the control group) to the cooking time of spaghetti in salted water (the experimental group).

1931	1931	"Question: Which animal is also adapted to use its neck to appear large and scary to a predator?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sand lizard (1) frillneck lizard
 Hint: Spectacled cobras are snakes. Their predators include mongooses and eagles. The cobra uses its neck to appear large and scary to a predator.
Figure: spectacled cobra.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the spectacled cobra.
When frightened, the spectacled cobra can spread out its hood to appear larger and more dangerous. If a predator is nearby, the hood can help scare it away.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The frillneck lizard has a layer of skin, called a frill,  around its neck. It uses its neck to appear larger and more dangerous to a predator.
The sand lizard has a short neck. Its neck is not adapted to help it appear larger and more dangerous to a predator."	"The answer is **(1) frillneck lizard**.

Who took the wheelbarrow out of the shed?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) declarative (1) interrogative
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The sentence asks something, and it ends with a question mark. It is an interrogative sentence."	"The answer is **(1) interrogative**. 

You are absolutely correct!  Here's why:

* **Interrogative sentences** are designed to ask questions. They always end with a question mark. 
* **Declarative sentences** state a fact or opinion. They typically end with a period. 

The sentence ""Who took the wheelbarrow out of the shed?"" is clearly asking a question, making it an interrogative sentence.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a motorboat that moved 110miles west in 10hours (1) a motorboat that moved 55miles west in 10hours (2) a motorboat that moved 165miles north in 10hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 55 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"You are absolutely correct! Here's a breakdown of why the answer is **(1) a motorboat that moved 55 miles west in 10 hours**:

* **Speed** is calculated by dividing distance traveled by the time it took.  
* **Distance:**  The motorboat in choice (1) traveled the shortest distance (55 miles).
* **Time:** All three motorboats traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours).

Since the motorboat in choice (1) covered the least distance in the same amount of time, it must have been moving at the slowest speed.

The boy helps his father after school.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) past tense (1) future tense (2) present tense
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The sentence is in present tense. You can tell because it uses a present-tense verb, helps. The verb ends in -s and tells you about something that is true or happening now."	"The correct answer is **(2) present tense**. 

Here's why:

* **Present tense** verbs describe actions happening now or actions that happen regularly. The verb ""helps"" in the sentence indicates a regular action the boy does after school. 

Let's look at the other options:

* **Past tense** verbs describe actions that happened in the past.  
* **Future tense** verbs describe actions that will happen in the future.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The beef barley soup will be tastier than the split pea soup would have been. (1) Dan will spend more time making the beef barley soup than he would have spent making the split pea soup.
 Hint: Dan is deciding whether to make beef barley soup or split pea soup for dinner. He wants dinner to be as tasty as possible. But he is also hungry and wants to eat soon.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Dan wants or needs:
Dan will spend more time making the beef barley soup than he would have spent making the split pea soup."	"The correct answer is **(1) Dan will spend more time making the beef barley soup than he would have spent making the split pea soup.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:**  A cost in economics is something you give up or spend in order to get something else.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The specific cost in this case is called an opportunity cost. This is the value of the next best alternative that you give up when you choose something else. 
* **The Scenario:**  Dan wants both tasty soup and a quick meal. By choosing beef barley soup, he gains a tastier meal but sacrifices time. The time he spends on beef barley soup is time he can't spend on other things, like eating sooner.

**Let's analyze the choices:**

* **(0) The beef barley soup will be tastier than the split pea soup would have been.** This is a benefit, not a cost. It's what Dan gains by choosing beef barley soup.

Therefore, the only choice that represents a cost for Dan is the extra time he will spend making the beef barley soup.

1939	1939	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
cutting an apple
shaking up salad dressing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Cutting an apple:** This is a physical change because you are altering the shape and size of the apple, but not its chemical composition. It's still an apple, just in smaller pieces.
* **Shaking up salad dressing:**  This is also a physical change. You are mixing the ingredients, but not changing their chemical makeup.  The oil and vinegar remain the same, just more evenly distributed. 

**Key Point:**  Physical changes are temporary and don't result in the formation of new substances. Chemical changes, on the other hand, result in the formation of new substances with different properties.

 Solution: To decide whether flying a plane is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is flying a plane something you can touch? No.
Is flying a plane a job you might pay someone else to do? Yes.
So, flying a plane is a service."	"The answer is **(0) a service**. 

Here's why:

* **Goods** are tangible items you can physically touch (e.g., a car, a book, a shirt).
* **Services** are intangible actions or activities performed for someone else (e.g., a haircut, a doctor's appointment, a concert).

Flying a plane involves a skilled service performed by a pilot. You can't physically hold the act of flying, but you can pay someone to do it for you.

 Hint: This organism is a cocoi heron. Its scientific name is Ardea cocoi.
 Solution: A cocoi heron's scientific name is Ardea cocoi.
Tyto alba does not have the same scientific name as a cocoi heron. So, Ardea cocoi and Tyto alba are not in the same species.
Ardea cocoi has the same scientific name as a cocoi heron. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Falco peregrinus does not have the same scientific name as a cocoi heron. So, Ardea cocoi and Falco peregrinus are not in the same species."	"The answer is **(2) Ardea cocoi**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:**  Scientific names are used to identify species. Organisms with the same scientific name belong to the same species. 
* **Cocoi Heron:**  The cocoi heron's scientific name is *Ardea cocoi*. 
* **Matching Name:** The only choice that shares this scientific name is *Ardea cocoi*.

 Choices: (0) Matt felt out of place. (1) Matt had not visited that location before.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an idiom, an expression that cannot be understood literally.
The idiom a fish out of water suggests that Matt felt out of place. A fish out of water is someone out of his or her usual, comfortable environment."	"The correct answer is **(0) Matt felt out of place.** 

Here's why:

* **The idiom ""fish out of water"" is used to describe someone who is uncomfortable or awkward in a situation they're not familiar with.** The text states that Matt was in an unfamiliar environment, suggesting he was feeling out of place.
* **Choice (1) is not the meaning of the idiom.** While it's true that Matt was in an unfamiliar environment, the idiom specifically implies a feeling of being out of place, not just unfamiliarity. 

Therefore, the idiom ""fish out of water"" suggests that Matt felt uncomfortable and out of place in the unfamiliar environment.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Banana browning:** This is a chemical reaction called oxidation. The banana's flesh reacts with oxygen in the air, changing its chemical composition and causing the browning.
* **Copper statue turning green:** This is also a chemical reaction called oxidation. The copper reacts with oxygen and water in the air, forming copper oxide (which is green).

 Hint: Two donkeys pull carts from the farmhouse to the yard. The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools.
 Solution: Look for the cart that is heavier.
A cart holding 82 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 59 pounds. So, the cart holding 82 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other cart."	"The answer is **(0) a cart holding 82 pounds**. 

Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  The force needed to move an object is directly related to its weight.  Heavier objects require more force to move them.
* **Equal Speed:** Since the donkeys are moving the carts at the same speed, the difference in force needed comes entirely from the weight of the carts.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and velocity. The particles in sample B have both higher mass and higher average speed.
* **Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy, sample B has the higher temperature.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

The size of a magnet affects the strength of its magnetic field, which in turn affects the force it exerts on other magnets. The smaller the magnet, the weaker its magnetic field, and the smaller the force.

In this case, the magnets in Pair 1 are the same size as the magnets in Pair 2, except for the smaller magnet in Pair 1. Since the magnet in Pair 1 is smaller, its magnetic force is weaker, resulting in a smaller magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1.

Ellen measured the initial weight of all six air plants. Then, for the next month, she continued to soak all of the air plants once a week. She also sprayed three of the plants every day. At the end of the month, Ellen measured the weights of the plants again.
Figure: an air plant displayed on a rock.
 Solution: In this experiment, Ellen investigated whether spraying air plants affects their growth. The plants that were only soaked in water were not sprayed. So, they were part of a control group."	"The answer is **(0) the plants that were only soaked in water**. 

Here's why:

* **Control group:** A control group in an experiment is a group that does not receive the treatment being tested. This allows the researcher to compare the results of the control group to the group receiving the treatment to see if there is a difference.
* **Treatment:** In this experiment, the treatment is spraying the air plants with water every day.
* **Control:** The plants that were only soaked in water did not receive the treatment, so they represent the control group.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two mugs of cider have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 35°C mug of cider is colder than the 55°C mug of cider, it has less thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) a 100-gram mug of cider at a temperature of 35°C**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:** Thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of the particles within an object.  The higher the temperature of an object, the faster its particles move, and the more thermal energy it possesses.

* **The mugs are identical:**  Since both mugs have the same mass and are made of the same substance (cider), the only difference is their temperature.

* **Lower temperature means less energy:**  The mug at 35°C is colder than the mug at 55°C. This means the particles in the colder mug are moving slower and therefore have less kinetic energy, resulting in lower thermal energy.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is (0). 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's calculated using the formula KE = (1/2)mv², where m is mass and v is velocity. 
* **Sample A:** The particles in sample A have higher mass (32 u) and higher average speed (1,100 m/s) compared to sample B.  This means their average kinetic energy is higher.
* **Temperature:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Since sample A has higher average kinetic energy, it must have the higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a plate of spaghetti at a temperature of 98°F (1) a plate of spaghetti at a temperature of 97°F (2) a plate of spaghetti at a temperature of 136°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three plates of spaghetti have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 97°F plate of spaghetti is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."	"You're absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) a plate of spaghetti at a temperature of 97°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a system due to the motion of its molecules.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those molecules.

The higher the temperature, the faster the molecules are moving, and the more thermal energy they have.  Since the 97°F plate has the lowest temperature, its molecules are moving the slowest, resulting in the least thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straight fur (1) Ff
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for straight fur, and the allele f is for curly fur.
Luce, a cat from this group, has straight fur. Luce has one allele for straight fur and one allele for curly fur.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Luce has one allele for straight fur (F) and one allele for curly fur (f). So, Luce's genotype for the fur type gene is Ff."	"The correct answer is **(1) Ff**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  This refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a particular trait.
* **Allele:**  A variation of a gene. In this case, we have 'F' for straight fur and 'f' for curly fur.
* **Luce's Description:**  We know Luce has straight fur, meaning she must have at least one 'F' allele. We also know she has one 'F' and one 'f' allele.

Therefore, Luce's genotype is **Ff**.

roasting a marshmallow over a campfire
grilling a hamburger
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Grilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Roasting a marshmallow** involves applying heat from the campfire, causing the marshmallow to change color, texture, and even taste. This is a chemical change.
* **Grilling a hamburger** also uses heat from the grill to cook the meat.  This alters the proteins in the meat, causing it to change color, texture, and taste.  Again, this is a chemical change. 

Both processes rely on heat as the driving force for the transformation.

(1) Last winter, Terrence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Terrence tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Terrence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The first text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Terrence's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Terrence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect."	"The correct answer is **(0)**. Here's why:

* **Traditional ""irony""** implies a situation where the outcome is the opposite of what was expected or intended, often with a touch of humor or poignancy. 

* **In choice (0),** Terrence goes to Florida to escape the snow, but a snowstorm hits Florida, creating a situation directly contrary to his intention. This is a classic example of ironic humor.

* **Choice (1)** describes a coincidence. While it might be unexpected, it doesn't have the element of a contrasting outcome or a sense of humor that defines traditional irony.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly with increasing distance. The closer the magnets are, the stronger the force between them.
* **Pair 2 is Closer:** Pair 2 has a distance of 7 mm between the magnets, while Pair 1 has a distance of 13.2 mm. 
* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** While attraction and repulsion affect the direction of the magnetic force, they don't change its magnitude.

Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Copper statue turning green:** This is a chemical change because the copper reacts with oxygen in the air to form a new substance, copper oxide (which is green). This is a chemical reaction that alters the composition of the copper.
* **Avocado turning brown:** This is also a chemical change. When the avocado is exposed to air, enzymes within it react with oxygen, causing the avocado to brown.  This is another example of a chemical reaction changing the composition of the avocado. 

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is primarily caused by cooling.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:**  These are chemical changes, not physical. Physical changes alter the appearance but not the chemical composition (e.g., melting ice).
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  While heat can sometimes accelerate chemical reactions, neither of these changes is caused directly by heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a 350-gram bath towel at a temperature of 21°F (1) a 350-gram bath towel at a temperature of 35°F (2) a 350-gram bath towel at a temperature of 18°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three bath towels have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 18°F towel is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."	"The answer is **(2) a 350-gram bath towel at a temperature of 18°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of a system due to its temperature.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within an object.
* **The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy the object has.**

Since all the towels have the same mass, the one with the lowest temperature (18°F) will have the least thermal energy.

After spending weeks in New York City, Jenny was a bit unnerved by the deafening silence of her small hometown.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) oxymoron (1) euphemism
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Deafening silence is a contradiction, because deafening describes something extremely loud, and silence is the absence of sound."	"The correct answer is **(0) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:** A figure of speech that combines two contradictory terms.  ""Deafening silence"" is a perfect example of this.
* **Euphemism:** A mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt.  This isn't present in the text.

The text effectively uses the oxymoron ""deafening silence"" to highlight the stark contrast between the bustling city and the quiet town.

2030	2030	"Question: Based on this information, what is Nero's genotype for the fur color gene?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) FF (1) orange fur
 Hint: In a group of Bengal tigers, some individuals have orange fur and others have white fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for orange fur, and the allele f is for white fur.
Nero, a Bengal tiger from this group, has orange fur. Nero has two alleles for orange fur.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Nero has two alleles for orange fur (F). So, Nero's genotype for the fur color gene is FF."	"The solution is correct. Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  This refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism carries for a particular gene.
* **Phenotype:** This refers to the physical expression of those genes, or what you actually see (like orange fur).

Since Nero has orange fur, we know he must have at least one ""F"" allele.  The question states he has *two* alleles for orange fur, so his genotype must be **FF**.

2033	2033	"Question: Based on this information, what is Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) short fur (1) long fur
 Hint: In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F).
Toby is a dog from this group. Toby has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur length gene.
 Solution: Toby's genotype for the fur length gene is ff. Toby's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for long fur. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Toby's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Toby's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur."	"The correct answer is **(1) long fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The allele for long fur (f) is recessive. This means that for an individual to have long fur, they need two copies of the 'f' allele.
* **Toby's Genotype:** Toby has the genotype 'ff', meaning he has two copies of the recessive 'f' allele.
* **Phenotype:** Since Toby has two copies of the recessive allele, his phenotype (observable trait) is long fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sour fruit (1) sweet fruit
 Hint: In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sweet fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for sour fruit (F).
A certain muskmelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit taste gene.
 Solution: The muskmelon plant's genotype for the fruit taste gene is ff. The muskmelon plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for sweet fruit. So, the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait must be sweet fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the muskmelon plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for sweet fruit (f) is recessive to the allele for sour fruit (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The muskmelon plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait must be sweet fruit."	"The correct answer is **(1) sweet fruit**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The plant has the genotype ""ff"", meaning it carries two copies of the recessive allele (f) for sweet fruit.
* **No Dominant Allele:**  Since there are no dominant ""F"" alleles present, the recessive trait (sweet fruit) is expressed. 
* **Phenotype:**  The phenotype refers to the observable trait. In this case, the plant's phenotype for fruit taste is **sweet fruit**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a cart holding 54 pounds (1) a cart holding 53 pounds
 Hint: Two donkeys pull carts from the farmhouse to the yard. The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools.
 Solution: Look for the cart that is heavier.
A cart holding 54 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 53 pounds. So, the cart holding 54 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other cart."	"The answer is **(0) a cart holding 54 pounds**. 

Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  The heavier an object is, the more force is needed to move it.  
* **Equal Speed:** Since the donkeys are moving both carts at the same speed, the heavier cart must be experiencing a larger force. 

The cart with 54 pounds needs more force to overcome its weight and move at the same speed as the lighter cart.

2039	2039	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a metal gate
burning a piece of wood
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Burning a piece of wood is a chemical change. When the wood burns, the type of matter in it changes. The wood turns black and gives off smoke.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But rust forming on a metal gate is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Rust formation:**  Rust is iron oxide, a completely different substance than the original iron in the gate. This change in composition is a chemical change. 
* **Burning wood:**  Wood burning involves combustion, a chemical reaction where wood reacts with oxygen, producing ash, smoke, and gases.  This is a clear chemical change. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling can sometimes lead to physical changes (like freezing water), but neither rust formation nor burning wood are primarily caused by cooling. 
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:** This is incorrect because both changes involve the formation of new substances.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:** While heating is necessary for burning wood, rust formation can happen at room temperature due to exposure to oxygen and moisture.

 Solution: Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the chalk is harder. If you squeeze a piece of chalk, it will not change shape."	"This is a great example of how to teach a concept like ""hardness"" using visual reasoning! Here's a breakdown of why the solution works:

**The Reasoning**

1. **Define ""hard"":** The solution correctly establishes the core concept of hardness as the ability to resist deformation (changing shape) under pressure. 
2. **Visual Representation:**  The prompt encourages the student to mentally picture pressing on each object.
3. **Apply the Concept:** The solution guides the student to realize that chalk will resist this pressure more than nylon swim shorts. 

**Why it Works**

* **Simple Language:** The explanation uses clear, straightforward language that's easy for a young learner to grasp.
* **Concrete Example:** The use of ""pushing on the material"" provides a relatable and visual way to understand the concept.
* **Focus on Observation:** The solution encourages the student to make their own observation about the material's behavior, which reinforces the understanding.

**Possible Improvements**

* **Visual Aid:**  Adding an image of the two objects (chalk and nylon swim shorts) would enhance the visual aspect of the learning.
* **Additional Examples:**  Providing a few more examples of ""hard"" and ""soft"" materials would help reinforce the concept further.

Overall, this solution effectively explains the concept of hardness in a way that's engaging and easy for young learners to understand.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its speed (KE = 1/2 * mv²). 
* **Sample A vs. Sample B:**  Sample A has particles with greater mass (46 u) and a higher average speed (630 m/s) than Sample B (28 u and 430 m/s). This means the particles in Sample A have significantly higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, it must have a higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Kentucky joined the United States in 1792. (1) Mr. Atkinson cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Atkinson washes the car.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two simple sentences joined by a comma and the conjunction and.
Mr. Atkinson cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Atkinson washes the car."	"You're absolutely right! 

Here's why the correct answer is **(1) Mr. Atkinson cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Atkinson washes the car.**

* **Compound Sentence:** A compound sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like *and*, *but*, *or*, *so*, *yet*, *for*). An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) Kentucky joined the United States in 1792.** This is a simple sentence. It has one independent clause.
* **(1) Mr. Atkinson cleans the chimney, and Mrs. Atkinson washes the car.** This is a compound sentence. It has two independent clauses: 
    * ""Mr. Atkinson cleans the chimney""
    * ""Mrs. Atkinson washes the car""
    * These clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction ""and.""

**Therefore, the correct answer is (1).**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Victoria adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old. (1) Victoria adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
Victoria adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
The first text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). The bridge is old, but it is not actually a million years old.
Victoria adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."	"You are absolutely right! The **first text** uses ""literally"" in its traditional sense. 

Here's why:

* **Traditional ""literally""**: Means something is true in a factual, non-exaggerated way. 
* **Nontraditional ""literally""**: Often used for emphasis or hyperbole, even when something is not *actually* true.

The Rialto Bridge is definitely hundreds of years old. This is a factual statement, making the use of ""literally"" in the first text correct.

The second text uses ""literally"" in a hyperbolic way, implying the bridge is incredibly old, which isn't accurate. 

**Key takeaway:**  The traditional use of ""literally"" ensures clarity and avoids misinterpretations.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  The temperature of a substance is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles.  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.
* **Calculating Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated with the formula: KE = 1/2 * mv², where 'm' is the mass and 'v' is the velocity. 
* **Sample A vs. Sample B:** 
    * **Sample A** has particles with a higher mass (34 u) and a higher average speed (570 m/s). This means the particles in Sample A will have a higher average kinetic energy.
    * **Sample B** has particles with a lower mass (16 u) and a lower average speed (530 m/s), resulting in a lower average kinetic energy.

Since Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, it will have a higher temperature.

 Hint: A motorcycle is swerving to the right to avoid a pothole.
 Solution: The motorcycle is changing direction. So, the motorcycle is accelerating."	"The solution is correct. Here's why:

* **Acceleration** is any change in velocity. Velocity includes both **speed** and **direction**. 
* Even if the motorcycle maintains a constant speed, changing direction means its velocity is changing.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** The direction of the magnetic force (attraction or repulsion) depends on the arrangement of the poles. This doesn't change the *strength* of the force.
* **Size and Distance:** The magnitude of the magnetic force is primarily determined by:
    * **Size of the magnets:** Both pairs have magnets of the same size.
    * **Distance between the magnets:** Both pairs have the magnets 1.5 inches apart.

Since both pairs have identical magnet sizes and distances, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same in both pairs.

2066	2066	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the thorns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having thorns (1) not having thorns
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype rr for the thorns gene.
 Solution: The rose plant's genotype for the thorns gene is rr. The rose plant's genotype of rr has only r alleles. The r allele is for not having thorns. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be not having thorns.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of rr has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be not having thorns."	"The correct answer is **(1) not having thorns**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype **rr**, meaning it has two copies of the recessive allele (r) for the thorns trait.
* **Recessive Allele:**  The 'r' allele is recessive, meaning it only expresses its trait (no thorns) when two copies are present. 
* **Phenotype:** Since the plant has two 'r' alleles, it will exhibit the recessive phenotype of **not having thorns**.

Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles."	"The answer is **(1) Solution B**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is about how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 10 green particles in 35 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 15 green particles in 35 mL of solvent.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
A puddle freezing is caused by cooling. But cutting an orange is not."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Freezing a puddle:** This is a change of state from liquid to solid. The water molecules themselves don't change, just their arrangement. This is a physical change.
* **Cutting an orange:** This simply changes the shape of the orange. The composition of the orange remains the same. This is also a physical change. 

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:**  Only cutting an orange could be caused by heating (if you use a knife heated by a flame).  Freezing is caused by cooling.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:** Only the freezing of the puddle is caused by cooling.

 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But a sandwich rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Cooking a pancake:**  The heat from cooking alters the chemical composition of the pancake batter, transforming it into a solid, cooked pancake. 
* **A sandwich rotting:** The process of rotting involves the breakdown of organic matter in the sandwich by bacteria and fungi. This is a chemical decomposition process.

Adriana has five toes on each foot.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Most humans are born with five toes on each foot. So, having five toes is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(1) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. The number of toes a person has is determined by their genetic makeup.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences. 

Since Adriana was born with five toes, this is a characteristic determined by her genes, making it an inherited trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter plate of spaghetti (1) the colder plate of spaghetti
 Hint: Two plates of spaghetti are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two plates of spaghetti are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter plate of spaghetti has more thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) the hotter plate of spaghetti**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of a system related to its temperature. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules within a substance.

 Solution: The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses an idiom (see eye to eye).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the idiom, so it is more formal overall."	"You're absolutely right! 

**Sentence (0) ""Senate leaders remain divided on the tax plan that they are negotiating"" is the more formal sentence.**

Here's why:

* **Idioms:** Sentence (1) uses the idiom ""do not see eye to eye,"" which is informal and casual.  
* **Formal Language:** Sentence (0) uses the more formal phrase ""remain divided,"" which conveys the same meaning but in a more professional and objective manner.

(1) Last winter, Zane took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Zane tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Zane took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The second text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Zane's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Zane took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect."	"You are absolutely correct! 

The first text uses ""ironic"" in its traditional sense, while the second text uses it in a more casual, colloquial way. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Traditional ""ironic"":**  Something is ironic when there's a stark contrast between expectation and reality, often with a touch of humor or absurdity. In the first text, Zane expected sunshine in Florida, but instead, he encountered a snowstorm. This is a classic example of irony.

* **Casual ""ironic"":**  In the second text, the word ""ironic"" is used to describe a coincidence. While it might be surprising to miss friends who were in the same place just the week before, this isn't really a case of ironic contrast.

As you mentioned, it's generally best to stick to the traditional meaning of ""ironic"" to avoid confusion and maintain a more formal writing style.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's directly related to both mass and speed:  KE = 1/2 * mass * velocity²
* **Sample A's Particles:** The particles in sample A have a higher average speed (630 m/s) and a greater mass (46 u) than the particles in sample B. This means their kinetic energy is significantly higher.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy, sample A has a higher temperature.

 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature. This means higher kinetic energy equates to a higher temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle
* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,100 m/s).
    * Sample A has particles with a greater mass (40 u) than sample B (32 u).
    * Since mass is greater in sample A, its particles will have a higher average kinetic energy, even with the same speed.

Therefore, sample A has the higher average kinetic energy and, consequently, the higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a cherry pie at a temperature of 80°F (1) a cherry pie at a temperature of 75°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75°F pie is colder than the 80°F pie, it has less thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) a cherry pie at a temperature of 75°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles. 

The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving, and the more thermal energy the object has.  Since the 75°F pie is colder, its particles are moving slower and have less thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder pencil (1) the hotter pencil
 Hint: Two pencils are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two pencils are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter pencil has more thermal energy."	"The answer is **(1) the hotter pencil**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **Higher temperature** means the particles are moving faster, which translates to more thermal energy.

Since the pencils are identical except for their temperatures, the hotter pencil has more thermal energy because its particles are moving faster.

2127	2127	"Question: Based on this information, what is Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Hera is a cow from this group. Hera has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Hera's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Hera's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Hera's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Hera's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Hera's genotype is LL:** This means she has two copies of the dominant allele (L) for black coat color.
* **Dominant alleles:**  A dominant allele will express its trait even if only one copy is present.  
* **Recessive alleles:**  A recessive allele (like 'l' for red coat) only expresses its trait if two copies are present.

Since Hera has two dominant alleles (LL), her phenotype (physical appearance) will be a black coat.

2129	2129	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
burning a candle
silver jewelry tarnishing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But silver tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Burning a candle:** This involves a chemical reaction where the wax combines with oxygen from the air, producing carbon dioxide, water vapor, and soot. The wax is transformed into new substances, indicating a chemical change.
* **Silver jewelry tarnishing:** This is also a chemical reaction.  The silver reacts with sulfur in the air, forming a black layer of silver sulfide (tarnish).  The silver is transformed into a new substance.

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While burning a candle requires heat, silver tarnishing can happen at room temperature.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:** Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical composition. Both burning and tarnishing involve a change in chemical composition.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** Cooling is not the primary factor in either process.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a greater distance (27.7 mm) between the magnets compared to Pair 2 (11.8 mm).
* **Conclusion:** Because the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sour fruit or sweet fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.
Sour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Sweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with sour fruit to offspring with sweet fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with sour fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with sweet fruit."	"The answer is **(1) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Sour Fruit:** The dominant allele (F) produces sour fruit. All genotypes in the Punnett square (FF, FF, Ff, Ff) contain at least one 'F', meaning all offspring will have sour fruit.
* **Sweet Fruit:** The recessive allele (f) produces sweet fruit.  The only way to have sweet fruit is to have the genotype 'ff'.  There are no 'ff' genotypes in the Punnett square.

Therefore, the ratio is 4 sour fruit : 0 sweet fruit.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A banana getting ripe on the counter is a chemical change. As a banana ripens, the type of matter in it changes. The peel changes color and the inside becomes softer and sweeter.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Banana ripening:** The process of a banana ripening involves chemical reactions within the fruit. Starches convert to sugars, causing the change in texture and sweetness. This is a chemical change because the composition of the banana changes. 
* **Milk going sour:**  Milk contains lactose, a sugar. Bacteria in the milk convert lactose into lactic acid. This acidification is a chemical change that alters the taste and composition of the milk.

**Important Note:** Both ripening and souring are examples of **decomposition reactions**.  These reactions break down complex molecules into simpler ones.

cells using oxygen to break down sugar
burning food on a stove
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Cells using oxygen to break down sugar is a chemical change. When sugar is broken down, it forms carbon dioxide and water.
Burning food on a stove is a chemical change. When the food burns, the type of matter in it changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But cells using oxygen to break down sugar is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Cells using oxygen to break down sugar** is a process called cellular respiration. This is a chemical reaction where sugar (glucose) is broken down in the presence of oxygen to release energy, carbon dioxide, and water. The molecules involved are transformed into different ones.
* **Burning food on a stove** is also a chemical reaction. The heat from the stove provides the energy to break down the food molecules, causing them to react with oxygen and producing ash, smoke, and other byproducts. The original food is changed into something different.

**Key takeaway:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties. Both of these examples demonstrate this principle.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a female cone (1) a male cone (2) a new plant
 Hint: Douglas fir seeds grow inside of cones.
 Solution: A seed can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow male and female cones. But a seed does not grow into a male cone or a female cone."	"The answer is **(2) a new plant**. 

Here's why:

* **Seeds contain the potential for a new life.** They hold the genetic information to grow into a complete organism.
* **Cones are reproductive structures.** They house the seeds, but they are not the seeds themselves. 

A Douglas fir seed will germinate and grow into a seedling, which will eventually become a mature tree.  This tree will then produce cones, both male and female, to continue the cycle.

 Hint: This organism is a bobcat. Its scientific name is Lynx rufus.
 Solution: A bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus.
Felis silvestris does not have the same scientific name as a bobcat. So, Lynx rufus and Felis silvestris are not in the same species.
Felis nigripes does not have the same scientific name as a bobcat. So, Lynx rufus and Felis nigripes are not in the same species.
Lynx rufus has the same scientific name as a bobcat. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"The answer is **(2) Lynx rufus**. 

Here's why:

* **Species classification:**  Species are defined by the ability of individuals to interbreed and produce fertile offspring. Organisms within the same species share the same scientific name. 
* **The bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus**.  
* **Lynx rufus is the only choice that matches the bobcat's scientific name.**

 Hint: Select the better answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
A bouncy object will bounce back from the floor if you drop it. Both objects are bouncy.
A slippery object is hard to hold onto or stand on. The spring is not slippery.
The property that both objects have in common is bouncy."	"The answer is **(0) bouncy**. 

Here's why:

* **Inflatable castle:**  These are designed to bounce and are often used for children to jump and play.
* **Spring:** Springs are known for their ability to stretch and return to their original shape, which is a form of bouncing. 

While a spring might be slightly slippery, an inflatable castle wouldn't be considered slippery. Therefore, bouncy is the better answer.

 Choices: (0) It has water at the bottom of the ocean. It also has organisms that crawl or stick to the ground. (1) It has bright sunlight. It also has organisms that crawl or stick to the ground.
 Hint: Figure: Kermadec Arc.
The Kermadec Arc is a deep sea ecosystem in the southern Pacific Ocean.
 Solution: The deep sea is a type of ecosystem. Deep sea ecosystems have the following features: water at the bottom of the ocean, no sunlight, and organisms that crawl or stick to the ground. So, the Kermadec Arc has water at the bottom of the ocean. It also has organisms that crawl or stick to the ground."	"The answer is **(0) It has water at the bottom of the ocean. It also has organisms that crawl or stick to the ground.**

Here's why:

* **Deep Sea Ecosystems:** The Kermadec Arc is a deep-sea ecosystem.  Deep-sea environments are characterized by:
    * **Lack of Sunlight:**  Sunlight does not penetrate to these depths.
    * **Water at the Bottom:**  Obviously, there is water at the bottom of the ocean.
    * **Organisms Adapted to Darkness:**  Deep-sea creatures have adaptations for living in the dark, often including bioluminescence.
    * **Benthic Organisms:** Many deep-sea organisms are benthic, meaning they live on or near the ocean floor.

 Solution: The first sentence is the complex sentence. It is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause begins with the subordinating conjunction although.
Although she left her house early, Mabel barely made it to the train station in time."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why the first sentence is the complex sentence:

* **Independent Clause:** ""Mabel barely made it to the train station in time."" This part of the sentence can stand alone as a complete thought.
* **Dependent Clause:** ""Although she left her house early"" This part of the sentence cannot stand alone as a complete thought. It depends on the independent clause to make sense.
* **Subordinating Conjunction:** The word ""although"" connects the dependent clause to the independent clause and indicates the relationship between the two ideas (in this case, a contrast).

The second sentence is a simple sentence because it contains only one independent clause.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) weather (1) climate
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Read the text carefully.
There are usually more days with low air pressure than high air pressure where Chloe lives.
Air pressure is caused by the weight of the air in the atmosphere. When the air pressure is low, the sky is usually cloudy. When the air pressure is high, the sky is usually clear.
This passage tells you about the usual pattern of air pressure where Chloe lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"The answer is **(1) climate**. 

Here's why:

* **Climate** refers to the long-term average weather patterns of a region. The passage states that there are ""usually"" more days with low air pressure than high air pressure. This indicates a general pattern over time, not a specific weather condition.
* **Weather** describes the atmospheric conditions at a specific time and location. The passage doesn't mention a particular day or time, so it's not describing the weather.

 Choices: (0) Happy 4th from the crew at Addison's. (1) Best wishes for an enjoyable Independence Day from the entire staff at Addison's Cafe.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first holiday greeting is more formal. It uses more elevated language (Independence Day, the entire staff). The other holiday greeting uses casual language (happy 4 th, the crew) that is more familiar in tone."	"The solution is correct! 

Here's a breakdown of why:

* **""Best wishes for an enjoyable Independence Day from the entire staff at Addison's Cafe""** uses more formal language:
    * **""Best wishes""** is a more formal greeting than ""Happy"".
    * **""Independence Day""** is the formal name of the holiday.
    * **""The entire staff""** is more formal than ""the crew"".

* **""Happy 4th from the crew at Addison's""** is more informal:
    * **""Happy 4th""** is a shortened, casual way to say ""Happy Independence Day"".
    * **""The crew""** is a casual term, implying a closer, more familiar relationship.

 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations (1) ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself (2) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that the opponent can't question the budget proposal because of his personal spending habits. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to whether the opponent's criticisms are valid. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."	"The correct answer is **(1) ad hominem**. 

Here's why:

* **Ad hominem** attacks the person making the argument rather than addressing the argument itself. The speaker is trying to discredit the opponent's criticism of the budget by pointing out their own spending habits, which are irrelevant to the actual merit of the budget proposal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Hasty generalization:** This involves drawing a broad conclusion from insufficient evidence. The text doesn't make a sweeping generalization about a whole group of people.
* **Circular reasoning:** This involves using the claim itself as evidence to support the claim. The text doesn't do this; it tries to discredit the opponent's argument with a separate, unrelated point.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) a hairless body
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).
Coco is a cat from this group. Coco has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body hair gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait. First, consider the alleles in Coco's genotype for the body hair gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Coco's genotype of Bb has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairy body."	"The correct answer is **(0) a hairy body**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Coco's genotype is Bb, meaning she has one dominant allele (B) for a hairy body and one recessive allele (b) for a hairless body.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant. This means that even with one copy of the dominant allele, the trait will be expressed.
* **Phenotype:** Since Coco has at least one dominant allele (B), her phenotype will be a hairy body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black wool (1) ll
 Hint: In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for white wool, and the allele l is for black wool.
Moxie, a sheep from this group, has black wool. Moxie has two alleles for black wool.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Moxie has two alleles for black wool (l). So, Moxie's genotype for the wool color gene is ll."	"The solution is correct. Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  The genetic makeup of an organism for a specific trait.
* **Allele:**  A variant form of a gene.
* **Phenotype:**  The observable characteristics of an organism, determined by its genotype.

Since Moxie has black wool, we know her phenotype. The problem states the allele ""l"" is responsible for black wool.  Since she has black wool, she must have two copies of the ""l"" allele (ll).  This makes her genotype ""ll"".

 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.
 Solution: Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait."	"The answer is **(0) acquired**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to their children through genes. 
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences.

Scars are a direct result of injuries, which are environmental factors.  Therefore, a scar is an acquired trait.

 Choices: (0) a 100-gram mug of cider at a temperature of 60°C (1) a 100-gram mug of cider at a temperature of 75°C
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two mugs of cider have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75°C mug of cider is hotter than the 60°C mug of cider, it has more thermal energy."	"The answer is **(1) a 100-gram mug of cider at a temperature of 75°C**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a substance due to the movement of its atoms and molecules.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those particles. 

The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving, and the more thermal energy they possess. Since the 75°C mug has a higher temperature, it has more thermal energy than the 60°C mug, even though they have the same mass.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction and.
Eduardo will read the script on his own, and then we'll practice our lines together."	"You are absolutely right! 

Here's why:

* **Compound Sentence:** A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and"", ""but"", ""or"", ""nor"", ""for"", ""so"", or ""yet"").

* **Independent Clause:** An independent clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) Despite their large size, grizzly bears can run at speeds of up to thirty miles per hour.** This is a **complex sentence**. It has a dependent clause (""Despite their large size"") and an independent clause (""grizzly bears can run at speeds of up to thirty miles per hour"").

* **(1) Eduardo will read the script on his own, and then we'll practice our lines together.**  This is a **compound sentence** because it has two independent clauses (""Eduardo will read the script on his own"" and ""we'll practice our lines together"") joined by the coordinating conjunction ""and"".

The Great Sphinx of Giza is a statue of a mythical sphinx, a creature with a lion's body and a human head. The Great Sphinx does not have all of the traits of a living thing. It does not grow or respond to the world around it. It does not need food or water.
A cave is not a living thing.
A cave may have animals or plants living inside. But a cave does not have all the traits of a living thing. A cave does not need food or water.
A sponge is a living thing.
Sponges grow and respond to their environment. They need food and water. Sponges are made up of many cells.
Sponges are animals. They eat tiny organisms that float in the water.
A kite is not a living thing.
A kite does not have all the traits of a living thing. It moves fast in the wind, but it does not grow. It does not need food or water."	"The correct answer is **(1) sponge**. 

Here's why:

* **Sponges** are multicellular organisms that belong to the animal kingdom. They exhibit all the characteristics of living things, including growth, reproduction, response to stimuli, and the need for food and water. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Kite:** A kite is an inanimate object made of materials like fabric and wood. It doesn't possess the qualities of a living thing.

 Hint: Nine-banded armadillos are adapted to defend their bodies against a predator with sharp teeth. They have hard scales covering much of their skin. When frightened, the  can roll into a ball to protect the soft parts of its body.
Figure: nine-banded armadillo.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the nine-banded armadillo.
The nine-banded armadillo has hard scales on its skin. Its skin is adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth. The scales make it difficult for predators to hurt or kill the nine-banded armadillo.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The giant pangolin has hard scales on its skin. Its skin is adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth.
The hyrax has thin fur covering its skin. Its skin is not adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth."	"The answer is **(1) giant pangolin**. 

Here's why:

* **Giant pangolins** have tough, overlapping scales made of keratin (the same material as human fingernails) that cover their bodies. These scales provide excellent protection against predators with sharp teeth. 
* **Hyraxes** have fur, which is not as effective at protecting against sharp teeth as scales. 

The hint and the image of the armadillo show the importance of hard, protective coverings for defense.  The pangolin's scales are similar in function to the armadillo's, making them the better-adapted animal for protection against sharp teeth.

an iceberg melting slowly
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Stretching a rubber band is a physical change. The rubber band gets longer. But it is still made of the same type of matter as before.
An iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water. As it melts, the water changes from a solid to a liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
An iceberg melting is caused by heating. But stretching a rubber band is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Stretching a rubber band:** This is a physical change because the rubber band is still made of the same material (rubber). It's just changed shape. 
* **An iceberg melting:** This is a change of state (solid to liquid), which is a physical change. The water molecules themselves haven't changed, just their arrangement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve forming new substances. Neither stretching a rubber band nor melting an iceberg creates a new substance.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** While melting an iceberg is caused by heating, stretching a rubber band can be caused by applying force. 
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** Neither change is directly caused by cooling.

 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kinsley. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kinsley.
 Hint: Kinsley is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kinsley with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kinsley with a force of 1,200N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Kinsley, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Kinsley down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Kinsley up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kinsley."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kinsley.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced Forces:**  The problem states that the seat of the cart is pushing Kinsley upwards with 1,200N of force, while gravity is pulling her downwards with 600N of force. These forces are not equal in magnitude, meaning they are unbalanced. 
* **Net Force:**  Since the forces are unbalanced, there is a net force acting on Kinsley. This net force is the difference between the upward and downward forces (1,200N - 600N = 600N). 

Even though other forces are assumed to be balanced, the imbalance between the upward force of the cart and the downward force of gravity creates a net force on Kinsley.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that a single boring class indicates that all classes on the same topic are dull. However, this isn't necessarily true. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."	"The correct answer is **(1) hasty generalization**. 

Here's why:

* **Hasty generalization:** The speaker is jumping to a conclusion about all literature classes based on the experience of only one class.  A single class doesn't represent the entire field.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Circular reasoning:**  This involves using the claim itself as evidence, which isn't happening here.
* **Ad hominem:** This is an attack on the person making the argument, not the argument itself. The text doesn't attack Mr. McClure personally.

 Solution: A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter."	"The answer is **(0) chemical change**. 

Here's why:

* **Chemical Change:** Involves the formation of new substances with different properties.  Rotting is a chemical process where bacteria break down the sandwich's components into different molecules. 
* **Physical Change:**  Only alters the form or appearance of a substance, not its chemical composition.  

Since the rotting sandwich is transforming into something entirely different (and likely smelly!), it's a chemical change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Erinaceus europaeus (1) Sciurus vulgaris (2) Lepus americanus
 Hint: This organism is a European hedgehog. Its scientific name is Erinaceus europaeus.
 Solution: A European hedgehog's scientific name is Erinaceus europaeus. The first word of its scientific name is Erinaceus.
This organism and the European hedgehog are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Erinaceus europaeus.
Sciurus vulgaris is in the genus Sciurus. The first word of its scientific name is Sciurus. So, Sciurus vulgaris and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same genus.
Lepus americanus is in the genus Lepus. The first word of its scientific name is Lepus. So, Lepus americanus and Erinaceus europaeus are not in the same genus."	"The answer is **(0) Erinaceus europaeus**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names and Genera:**  Scientific names are two-part names, with the first part indicating the genus and the second part the species. 
* **Erinaceus europaeus:** The European hedgehog's scientific name. 
* **Genus:** The genus is ""Erinaceus.""  
* **Same Genus:**  Since ""Erinaceus europaeus"" also has ""Erinaceus"" as its genus, it's in the same genus as the European hedgehog. 

The other options are incorrect because they belong to different genera:

* **Sciurus vulgaris:**  Red squirrel, genus ""Sciurus""
* **Lepus americanus:** Snowshoe hare, genus ""Lepus""

Mr. Hoffman argues that we need to do more to prevent workplace injuries and fatalities. I doubt that someone so socially awkward would know a thing about office safety.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent (1) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that being socially awkward determines knowledge of workplace safety. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to Mr. Hoffman's desire to prevent workplace injuries. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem."	"The correct answer is **(0) ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent**. 

Here's why:

* **Ad hominem** attacks the person making the argument rather than the argument itself.  The text criticizes Mr. Hoffman's social awkwardness, suggesting it makes him unqualified to talk about workplace safety, rather than addressing the merits of his argument.

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **False causation** is about assuming a cause-and-effect relationship where none exists. This isn't present in the text.

 Hint: This passage describes the leaf type trait in tomato plants:

In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have regular leaves and others have potato leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf type trait has two alleles. The allele L is for regular leaves, and the allele l is for potato leaves.
A certain tomato plant from this group has potato leaves. This plant has two alleles for potato leaves.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The tomato plant has two alleles for potato leaves (l). So, the plant's genotype for the leaf type gene is ll."	"The correct answer is **(1) ll**. 

Here's why:

* The passage states that the allele ""l"" represents potato leaves.
* The tomato plant in question has potato leaves and possesses two alleles for this trait.
* Since it has two ""l"" alleles, its genotype must be **ll**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has mostly small plants. (1) It has warm summers and cool winters.
 Hint: Figure: Tibetan Plateau.
The Tibetan Plateau is a tundra ecosystem located in Tibet, western China, and northern India. The plateau is over 14,800 feet high and is surrounded by many mountain ranges.
 Solution: A tundra is a type of ecosystem. Tundras have the following features: long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants. So, the following statements describe the Tibetan Plateau ecosystem: long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants. It has mostly small plants. It has soil that is frozen year-round. The following statement does not describe the Tibetan Plateau: long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants. It has warm summers and cool winters."	"The correct answer is **(0) It has mostly small plants.**

Here's why:

* **Tundra Ecosystems:** The Tibetan Plateau is classified as a tundra ecosystem. Tundras are characterized by cold temperatures, permafrost (permanently frozen ground), and limited vegetation. The harsh conditions make it difficult for large trees to grow, so the dominant plant life is small, including grasses, mosses, and lichens.

* **Why (1) is incorrect:** Tundras are known for their long, cold winters and short, cool summers. The Tibetan Plateau is a high-altitude region, and its climate reflects this, with temperatures generally below freezing for much of the year.

 Hint: Hint: Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.
 Solution: Read the text carefully.
Where Cole lives, winter is the rainiest season of the year.
This passage tells you about the usual precipitation where Cole lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"The answer is **(1) climate**. 

Here's why:

* **Weather** refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place (e.g., sunny and 75 degrees today). 
* **Climate** refers to the long-term weather patterns in a region (e.g., winters are rainy, summers are hot and dry).

The passage states that winter is the rainiest season of the year *where Cole lives*. This indicates a pattern of weather over a longer period, defining the climate of that region.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:**  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It depends on both an object's mass and its speed. The formula is KE = 1/2 * mv², where KE is kinetic energy, m is mass, and v is velocity. 
* **Sample A vs. Sample B:** Sample A has particles with higher mass (36 u) and higher average speed (1,600 m/s) compared to Sample B (16 u and 1,500 m/s). This means the particles in Sample A have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature:**  Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, it must have a higher temperature.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Monica doesn't have school spirit, because she doesn't go to football games. However, there may be a number of reasons why Monica doesn't go to football games. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy."	"The correct answer is **(1) false dichotomy**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument presents only two choices:**
    * Monica goes to football games = She has school spirit.
    * Monica doesn't go to football games = She doesn't have school spirit.

* **This is a false dichotomy because there are other possibilities:**

Sasha will give up the chance to see the zebras. She would have enjoyed seeing them more than the baboons."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Choice (1)** is the correct answer. Here's why:

* **Cost in Economics:**  In economics, a cost is anything that is given up or sacrificed when making a choice. 
* **Sasha's Situation:** Sasha has a limited time at the zoo. By choosing to see the baboons, she is giving up the opportunity to see the zebras, which she values more. This missed opportunity is a cost.

Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Pouring milk on oatmeal:** This is a physical change because it involves a change in the physical state of the oatmeal (it becomes softer and wetter) but not a change in its chemical composition. 
* **Erosion caused by wind:**  This is also a physical change. Wind physically breaks down rocks into smaller pieces, but it doesn't alter the chemical makeup of the rock. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating.**  Neither change is directly caused by heating.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling.** Neither change is directly caused by cooling.
* **(3) Both are chemical changes.**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions. Neither of these changes create new substances.

Helen told her friends that Eli was a typical Peter Pan type.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a song (1) literature
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Peter Pan is literature.
In a J. M. Barrie novel, the character Peter Pan retreats to Neverland and refuses to grow up.
The allusion Peter Pan means a person who won't take on adult responsibilities."	"The correct answer is **(1) literature**. 

Here's why:

* **Peter Pan** is a character from the novel *Peter Pan and Wendy* by J.M. Barrie. 
* The character's refusal to grow up and his escapades in Neverland have become iconic, and ""Peter Pan"" is now used as a literary allusion to describe anyone who avoids adult responsibilities or clings to childhood innocence. 

The sentence ""Helen told her friends that Eli was a typical Peter Pan type"" uses this allusion to suggest that Eli is someone who doesn't want to grow up or face real-world challenges.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** The magnets in Pair 2 are 4 inches apart, while the magnets in Pair 1 are only 2 inches apart.  Since Pair 2 has a greater distance, the magnetic force between them is weaker.

After he finished the marathon, Edgar collapsed into a chair and declared that he could no longer move a single muscle.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Edgar was very tired and sore. (1) Edgar became paralyzed.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses hyperbole, an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
The hyperbole could no longer move a single muscle suggests that Edgar was very tired and sore. His muscles were not literally incapable of moving."	"The correct answer is **(0) Edgar was very tired and sore.**

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole:** Hyperbole is a figure of speech that uses exaggeration for emphasis or humor.  
* **The Exaggeration:** Saying Edgar couldn't move a single muscle is a clear exaggeration. It's unlikely he was completely paralyzed after a marathon.
* **The Implication:**  The hyperbole suggests that Edgar was extremely exhausted and sore, making it feel like he couldn't move at all. 

Option (1) is incorrect because the text uses hyperbole, which is not meant to be taken literally. While Edgar might have felt extremely fatigued, he was not actually paralyzed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample B**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:**  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.  It depends on both mass and speed. 
* **Equal Speeds:** Both samples have the same average particle speed.
* **Different Masses:** Sample B's particles have a higher mass (46 u) than Sample A's particles (36 u).
* **Higher Kinetic Energy:** Since Sample B's particles have the same speed but a higher mass, they have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  Higher kinetic energy means a higher temperature.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Complete the sentence with the phrase creeps up on you. It describes time as if it were a sneaky person."	"The correct answer is **(0) creeps up on you**. 

This choice uses personification because it gives the abstract concept of time a human-like quality of ""creeping"". This creates a vivid image and emphasizes the idea that time is something that can sneak up on you unexpectedly.

2257	2257	"Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** Whether magnets attract or repel only affects the direction of the force, not its magnitude.
* **Size Matters:** The size of a magnet directly influences the strength of its magnetic field.  Larger magnets produce stronger fields.
* **Comparison:**  In Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than in Pair 2. Since Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in that pair will be weaker.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Christine will save some money by not buying the book. (1) Christine will give up the chance to keep the book as long as she wants.
 Hint: Christine is deciding whether to buy a copy of a book or borrow it from the library. She would like to be able to keep the book as long as she wants, but buying the book would cost money. She could borrow the book for free, but she would have to return it in a few weeks.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Christine wants or needs:
Christine will give up the chance to keep the book as long as she wants."	"You are absolutely correct! 

The correct answer is **(1) Christine will give up the chance to keep the book as long as she wants.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:**  A cost represents something you have to give up or spend in order to get something else. In this case, Christine is giving up the ability to keep the book permanently by choosing to borrow it. This is a cost because she values having the book indefinitely.

* **Benefit:**  The benefit of borrowing is saving money. This is not a cost; it's the opposite.

The hint effectively points out this trade-off: Christine wants both the book and the money, but she can't have both. Borrowing gives her the book for free but with a limited time. Buying it allows her to keep it forever but costs money.

 Hint: This organism is a Grevy's zebra. Its scientific name is Equus grevyi.
 Solution: A Grevy's zebra's scientific name is Equus grevyi. The first word of its scientific name is Equus.
This organism and the Grevy's zebra are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Equus grevyi.
Macropus giganteus is in the genus Macropus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. So, Macropus giganteus and Equus grevyi are not in the same genus.
Camelus bactrianus is in the genus Camelus. The first word of its scientific name is Camelus. So, Camelus bactrianus and Equus grevyi are not in the same genus."	"The answer is **(1) Equus grevyi**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The supply will probably go down. (1) The supply will probably go up.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Castroville. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down."	"The answer is **(0) The supply will probably go down.** 

Here's why:

* **Reduced Production:**  If Castroville's cough drop factories are destroyed, they can no longer produce cough drops. This means the overall production of cough drops will decrease.
* **Supply and Demand:**  A decrease in production directly leads to a decrease in supply.  

The destruction of the factories in Castroville will likely result in a shortage of cough drops, leading to higher prices and potentially difficulty finding them in stores.

 Solution: The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two simple sentences joined by a comma and the conjunction or.
The dancer practices after work, or she dances on weekends."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why the first sentence is *not* a compound sentence:

* **Simple Sentence:**  ""Tomorrow the price of gas may go up.""  This sentence has one independent clause (a complete thought) and expresses a single idea.

* **Two Independent Clauses:** The sentence contains two separate clauses that could stand alone:
    * ""The dancer practices after work.""
    * ""She dances on weekends.""
* **Conjunction:** The clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction ""or,"" indicating a choice or alternative.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Brett claims that Americans should stop learning English and only study foreign languages. However, this misrepresents Brett's argument. Brett only wants more foreign language instruction. He says nothing about eliminating English instruction. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man."	"The correct answer is **(2) straw man**. 

Here's why:

* **Straw man fallacy:** This occurs when someone misrepresents their opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. In this case, the speaker twists Brett's argument about adding foreign language classes into a claim that Brett wants to eliminate English instruction entirely. This misrepresentation makes it easier to dismiss Brett's argument.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) False causation:** This fallacy involves incorrectly linking two events as cause and effect when there's no real connection. This isn't present in the text.
* **(1) Appeal to nature:** This fallacy argues something is good because it's natural. The text doesn't mention anything about nature.

Here's a breakdown of why the first sentence is complex:

* **Independent Clause:** ""Ethan's ears were ringing"" - This clause can stand alone as a complete sentence.
* **Dependent Clause:** ""after he stood near the stage for the entire concert"" - This clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. It relies on the independent clause to make sense.

Here's why:

* The argument claims that large profits *must* be due to exploitation. 
* It then supports this claim by stating that the *only* way to make large profits is through exploitation.

* **Support:**  The only way to have huge profits is to exploit customers.
* **Problem:** This support assumes the very thing it's trying to prove. It doesn't offer any independent evidence that large profits *necessarily* mean exploitation. 

The other options are not relevant:

* **False Causation:** This fallacy involves mistaking correlation for causation. The text doesn't make a claim about two things happening together.
* **Bandwagon Fallacy:**  This fallacy relies on the popularity of an idea to prove its validity. The text doesn't appeal to the popularity of any idea.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Read the text carefully.
Where Heather lives, winter is the rainiest season of the year.
This passage tells you about the usual precipitation where Heather lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"The passage describes **(1) climate**. 

Here's why:

* **Climate** refers to the long-term average weather patterns of a region. The passage states that winter is the rainiest season in Heather's location, which is a typical characteristic of the area's climate. 
* **Weather** describes the atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place. The passage doesn't specify a particular day or time, making it a description of a general pattern (climate).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	"The answer is (0).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly related to its mass and speed.  KE = (1/2)mv^2
* **Same Conditions:** Both samples have the same:
    * Mass of particles (46 u)
    * Average particle speed (1000 m/s)
* **Equal Kinetic Energy:** Since both samples have the same mass and speed, their particles have the same average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Since the average kinetic energies are equal, the temperatures are equal.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 2 has a smaller distance (2.5 inches) between its magnets compared to Pair 1 (4 inches).
* **Conclusion:** Because the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the block of iron with less mass (1) the block of iron with more mass
 Hint: The objects are made of the same type of matter.
 Solution: The two blocks of iron have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the block of iron with less mass has less thermal energy."	"The solution is correct! Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a system due to its temperature.  This energy is related to the kinetic energy of the molecules within the object.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules. 
* **Mass** is a measure of the amount of matter in an object.

Since the two blocks of iron have the same temperature, the molecules in both blocks have the same average kinetic energy. However, the block with less mass has fewer molecules. Therefore, it has less total thermal energy. 

**In summary:**  The block of iron with **less mass** has less thermal energy.

 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Roasting is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Roasting a marshmallow:** This involves a chemical reaction where the sugars in the marshmallow caramelize and break down, changing its composition and appearance.
* **Copper statue turning green:** This is a process called oxidation where copper reacts with oxygen and water in the air to form copper oxide, a green compound. This is a chemical change as the copper's composition changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:**  While roasting a marshmallow involves heating, the greening of copper is caused by a reaction with oxygen and water, not just heat.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is primarily caused by cooling. 
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the form of matter, but not its chemical composition. Both these processes involve changes in the chemical makeup of the substances involved.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**.

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to the temperature.  
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where m is the mass and v is the velocity (speed). 

Since the particles in sample A have a higher average speed (950 m/s) compared to the particles in sample B (790 m/s), and both have the same mass, sample A has a higher average kinetic energy and therefore a higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the surroundings . . . each greenhouse (1) each greenhouse . . . the surroundings
 Hint: Two identical greenhouses were next to each other. There were solar panels on the roof of one greenhouse but not on the roof of the other greenhouse. This table shows how the temperature of each greenhouse changed over 2hours.
 Solution: The temperature of each greenhouse increased, which means that the thermal energy of each greenhouse increased. So, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each greenhouse."	"The answer is **(0) the surroundings . . . each greenhouse**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy transfer:** Thermal energy always flows from a warmer object to a cooler object.
* **Temperature increase:** The table shows that the temperature of both greenhouses increased, indicating that they gained thermal energy.
* **Source of heat:**  Since the greenhouses were next to each other, they were exposed to the same surroundings. This means the surroundings were the source of the thermal energy that increased the temperature of the greenhouses.

It's an open secret that Colin is writing a book based on his experiences living in Singapore. He never talks about it, but almost all his friends know.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) euphemism (1) oxymoron
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Open secret is a contradiction, because open describes something that is freely or publicly known, and a secret is hidden."	"The correct answer is **(1) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:** A figure of speech that combines contradictory terms (like ""open secret""). 

The phrase ""open secret"" is a classic example of an oxymoron because it juxtaposes the idea of something being publicly known with the idea of something being hidden. 

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **Euphemism:** A mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. 

The phrase ""open secret"" doesn't use a milder term to replace a harsher one; it simply combines two contrasting ideas.

acid rain weathering a marble statue
baking a loaf of bread
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But acid rain weathering a marble statue is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Acid rain weathering a marble statue:** The acid in the rain reacts with the calcium carbonate in the marble, breaking it down into different substances. This is a chemical reaction that changes the composition of the marble.
* **Baking a loaf of bread:** The heat from the oven causes complex chemical reactions within the dough. The starches in the flour gelatinize, the sugars caramelize, and proteins denature.  These chemical changes transform the raw dough into a cooked loaf of bread. 

**Key takeaway:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties. Both acid rain weathering and baking bread involve these fundamental changes in the matter involved.

 Choices: (0) a cherry pie at a temperature of 43°C (1) a cherry pie at a temperature of 24°C (2) a cherry pie at a temperature of 35°C
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 24°C pie is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) a cherry pie at a temperature of 24°C**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of an object due to its temperature.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within an object. 
* **Higher temperature means higher average kinetic energy and thus more thermal energy.**

Since all three cherry pies are identical except for their temperatures, the one with the lowest temperature (24°C) will have the least thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample B**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and velocity. The equation is KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where KE is kinetic energy, m is mass, and v is velocity.
* **Sample B's Advantage:** The particles in sample B have both a higher mass (36 u compared to 32 u) and a higher average speed (960 m/s compared to 780 m/s).  This means their kinetic energy will be significantly higher than the particles in sample A.

**Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance.  Since sample B's particles have a higher average kinetic energy, it means sample B has a higher temperature.

In the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight than it would in the shadowy lower parts of the forest. The additional sunlight allows the orchid to perform more photosynthesis. There is also more wind in the canopy, which helps the orchid spread its seeds to other branches.
The orchid does not damage the tree it grows on, but it also does not provide resources to the tree.
Figure: epiphytic orchids growing on trees in a tropical forest.
 Solution: When an epiphytic orchid grows on a tree branch in the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight and wind than it would if it grew on the forest floor. So, the orchid benefits from its relationship with the tree.
The tree is not damaged by the orchid, but the tree is not helped, either. So, the tree is not significantly affected by its relationship with the orchid.
Since the orchid benefits and the tree is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when an epiphytic orchid grows on a tree branch in the canopy."	"The answer is **(2) commensal**. 

Here's why:

* **Commensalism** is a relationship where one organism benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor helped. In this case, the orchid benefits from the tree by getting more sunlight and wind, while the tree is not significantly impacted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Parasitic:**  A parasitic relationship involves one organism benefiting at the expense of the other. The orchid doesn't harm the tree, so this doesn't apply.
* **Mutualistic:** A mutualistic relationship benefits both organisms. While the orchid benefits, the tree doesn't gain anything from the orchid's presence.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a speed walker who moved 40kilometers in 5hours (1) a speed walker who moved 45kilometers in 5hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each speed walker moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One speed walker moved 40 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other speed walker moved 45 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each speed walker spent the same amount of time moving. The speed walker who moved 40 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that speed walker must have moved at a lower speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) a speed walker who moved 40 kilometers in 5 hours**.

Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time.** 
* Both walkers walked for the same amount of time (5 hours).
* The walker who covered 40 kilometers traveled a shorter distance in that time.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass
    * v = velocity (speed)
* **Comparing the Samples:** 
    * Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,500 m/s).
    * Sample B has particles with a greater mass (44 u) than Sample A (26 u).
    * Since the mass is higher in Sample B, and the speed is the same, the kinetic energy of particles in Sample B will be higher.

Therefore, Sample B has a higher average kinetic energy and, consequently, a higher temperature.

2359	2359	"Question: What type of rock is dolostone?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metamorphic (1) sedimentary (2) igneous
 Hint: Dolostone is a rock that forms from ocean sediment. Dolostone is made mostly of the mineral dolomite. This piece of dolostone also contains yellow grains of the mineral sulphur.
Ocean sediment can contain the shells of marine organisms. As many layers of ocean sediment build up, the shells can go through a chemical reaction that forms new minerals, such as dolomite. Dolostone forms when these chemically changed sediments are pressed together to form rock.
 Solution: Dolostone is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Ocean sediment builds up in layers. Over time, the sediment can go through a chemical reaction with the water around it. As many layers of the sediment build up, the top layers press down on the bottom layers. Dolostone forms when the bottom layers of the chemically changed sediment are pressed together to form rock."

2378	2378	"Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** The direction of the magnetic force depends on whether the poles are attracting or repelling.  Pair 1 shows attraction (opposite poles), and Pair 2 shows repulsion (like poles). However, the direction of the force doesn't impact the strength of the force.
* **Factors Influencing Strength:** The strength of the magnetic force depends on:
    * **Magnet Size:** The magnets in both pairs are the same size.
    * **Distance:** The magnets in both pairs are the same distance apart.
    * **Material:** The magnets are made of the same material.

Since all these factors are identical in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same.

 Hint: Hint: Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are vertebrates.
 Solution: A nautilus is a mollusk. Like other mollusks, a nautilus is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone.
A ladybug is an insect. Like other insects, a ladybug is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
An Asian elephant is a mammal. Like other mammals, an Asian elephant is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
A grasshopper is an insect. Like other insects, a grasshopper is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton."	"The correct answer is **(2) Asian elephant**. 

Here's why:

* **Vertebrates** are animals with a backbone (spinal column). 
* **Mammals** are a class of vertebrates.
* **Asian elephants** are mammals, and therefore have a backbone. 

The other choices are all invertebrates:

* **Nautilus:**  A mollusk, lacking a backbone.

2380	2380	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
picking up a paper clip with a magnet
water evaporating from a lake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Picking up a paper clip with a magnet is a physical change. The paper clip sticks to the magnet, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But picking up a paper clip with a magnet is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Picking up a paper clip with a magnet:** This is a physical change because the paper clip's composition remains the same. It's just being attracted by the magnet's magnetic force.
* **Water evaporating from a lake:** This is also a physical change because the water molecules are simply changing state from liquid to gas. The chemical composition of water (H₂O) remains unchanged. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can cause evaporation, a magnet picking up a paper clip is not caused by heating.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:**  Both changes involve no new substances being formed, which is a key characteristic of physical changes.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is directly caused by cooling.

 Hint: This organism is a great egret. Its scientific name is Ardea alba.
 Solution: A great egret's scientific name is Ardea alba. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea cinerea and Ardea alba are in the same genus.
Tyto alba and Ardea alba are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Tyto alba and Ardea alba have the same species name within their genus, alba. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Tyto alba is in the genus Tyto, and Ardea alba is in the genus Ardea.
Hystrix cristata is in the genus Hystrix. The first word of its scientific name is Hystrix. So, Hystrix cristata and Ardea alba are not in the same genus."	"The answer is **(1) Ardea cinerea**. 

Here's why:

* **Genus:** The genus is the first part of an organism's scientific name. The great egret's scientific name is *Ardea alba*, meaning its genus is *Ardea*.
* **Matching Genus:** The only choice that also has *Ardea* as its genus is *Ardea cinerea*.

 Solution: A California newt's scientific name is Taricha torosa. The first word of its scientific name is Taricha.
Taricha granulosa is in the genus Taricha. The first word of its scientific name is Taricha. So, Taricha granulosa and Taricha torosa are in the same genus.
Ambystoma texanum is in the genus Ambystoma. The first word of its scientific name is Ambystoma. So, Ambystoma texanum and Taricha torosa are not in the same genus.
Ambystoma opacum is in the genus Ambystoma. The first word of its scientific name is Ambystoma. So, Ambystoma opacum and Taricha torosa are not in the same genus."	"The answer is **(1) Taricha granulosa**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Naming:**  Organisms are classified using a system called binomial nomenclature.  The first part of a scientific name is the genus, and the second part is the species.
* **Genus Taricha:** The California Newt (Taricha torosa) belongs to the genus *Taricha*. The other organism listed with the same genus is *Taricha granulosa*.

 Hint: Two identical aquariums were next to an open window. One aquarium had a plastic cover on it, and the other was uncovered. This table shows how the temperature of each aquarium changed over 1.5hours.
 Solution: The temperature of each aquarium decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each aquarium decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each aquarium to the surroundings."	"The answer is **(0) each aquarium . . . the surroundings**. 

Here's why:

* **Temperature Decrease:** The table shows that the final temperature of both aquariums is lower than their initial temperature. This indicates a loss of heat energy.
* **Heat Transfer:** Heat always flows from a hotter object to a cooler object. Since the aquariums cooled down, they lost heat to the surroundings. 
* **Surroundings:** The surroundings, being the open window and the surrounding air, were likely cooler than the aquariums, causing the heat transfer.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having Thomsen disease (1) Mm
 Hint: This passage describes the Thomsen disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have Thomsen disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having Thomsen disease, and the allele m is for not having Thomsen disease.
Tammy, a human from this group, has Thomsen disease. Tammy has one allele for having Thomsen disease and one allele for not having Thomsen disease.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Tammy has one allele for having Thomsen disease (M) and one allele for not having Thomsen disease (m). So, Tammy's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is Mm."	"The correct answer is **(1) Mm**. 

Here's why:

* **Thomsen disease is caused by the dominant allele ""M"".** This means if you have at least one ""M"" allele, you will have the disease.
* **Tammy has Thomsen disease.** This tells us she must have at least one ""M"" allele.
* **Tammy also has one allele for not having Thomsen disease (m).**  This is stated directly in the passage.

Therefore, Tammy's genotype must be **Mm** because she carries both the dominant ""M"" allele (causing Thomsen disease) and the recessive ""m"" allele (not causing Thomsen disease).

A certain muskmelon plant from this group has sweet fruit. This plant has two alleles for sweet fruit.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The muskmelon plant's observable version of the fruit taste trait is sweet fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait is sweet fruit."	"The correct answer is **(1) sweet fruit**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical characteristics of an organism. In this case, the observable characteristic is the taste of the fruit.
* The plant has **sweet fruit**, which is the observed trait. 
* Even though we know the plant's genotype (the genetic makeup) is ""ff"" (two alleles for sweet fruit), the question specifically asks for the phenotype. 

Therefore, the muskmelon plant's phenotype for the fruit taste trait is **sweet fruit**.

""Baldwin's personality is very Jekyll and Hyde,"" Krysta told her brother.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) U.S. history (1) literature
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Jekyll and Hyde is literature.
Robert Louis Stevenson's popular Victorian novella Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde tells the story of a man with two distinct personalities. Known to the world as a kind and highly respected doctor, at night he transforms into a monstrous person.
The allusion Jekyll and Hyde means kind then cruel."	"The answer is **(1) literature**. 

The phrase ""Jekyll and Hyde"" refers to the characters from Robert Louis Stevenson's novella *The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. The novella explores the duality of human nature, with Dr. Jekyll representing the good side and Mr. Hyde representing the evil side.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that all cyclists are rude and aggressive. However, even though one cyclist was rude, that doesn't necessarily mean that all cyclists are rude. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization."	"The correct answer is **(0) hasty generalization**. 

Here's why:

* **Hasty generalization:** The speaker draws a broad conclusion about all cyclists based on a single negative experience.  They are assuming that because one cyclist was rude, all cyclists must be. 

Let's break down why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Guilt by association:** This fallacy involves associating someone or something with a negative group or characteristic to discredit them. This doesn't apply here because the speaker isn't trying to discredit anyone based on their association with cyclists. They are simply making a generalization about the entire group.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 11 gallons (1) 11 fluid ounces (2) 11 cups
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank is 11 gallons.
11 fluid ounces and 11 cups are both too little."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why 11 gallons is the best estimate:

* **Fluid ounces and cups are too small:** A car's gas tank would be incredibly tiny if it only held 11 fluid ounces or 11 cups.
* **Gallons are the standard:**  Car gas tank capacities are typically measured in gallons.  A standard car might have a tank between 12 and 20 gallons.

**Therefore, 11 gallons is the most reasonable estimate for a car's gas tank volume.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's calculated by the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * KE is kinetic energy
    * m is mass
    * v is velocity (speed)

* **Comparing the Samples:** Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,300 m/s). However, the particles in sample A have a higher mass (46 u) than the particles in sample B (36 u). Since the mass is greater in sample A, the kinetic energy of the particles in sample A will be higher.

* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  Higher average kinetic energy means higher temperature.

Mr. Lambert is enjoying his golden years in a luxurious beachside community just down the street from his grandchildren.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Mr. Lambert is rich. (1) Mr. Lambert is old.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The euphemism golden years indicates that Mr. Lambert is old. Golden years is a nicer way of referring to old age."	"The correct answer is **(1) Mr. Lambert is old.**

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:** ""Golden years"" is a euphemism for old age. It's a gentler, more positive way to refer to the later stages of life.
* **Suggestion:**  The use of ""golden years"" directly suggests that Mr. Lambert is in his later years.

While it's possible Mr. Lambert is also wealthy, the text doesn't explicitly state that. The focus is on his age, not his financial status.

 Choices: (0) the surroundings . . . each cake (1) each cake . . . the surroundings
 Hint: Austin baked two identical cakes. When he took them out of the oven, he left one cake in its pan and took the other cake out of its pan to put it on a plate. This table shows how the temperature of each cake changed over 5minutes.
 Solution: The temperature of each cake decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each cake decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each cake to the surroundings."	"The answer is **(1) each cake . . . the surroundings**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy transfer:** Heat always flows from a warmer object to a cooler object.
* **Cooling cakes:** The cakes' temperatures decreased, indicating that they lost thermal energy.
* **Surroundings:** The surroundings (air, table, etc.) were cooler than the cakes, so the thermal energy transferred from the cakes to the surroundings.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size Matters:** The strength of a magnetic force depends on the size of the magnets. Larger magnets have stronger magnetic fields.
* **Pair 2 has a larger magnet:**  In Pair 2, the circular magnet is larger than the rectangular magnet in Pair 1. This means the magnetic force in Pair 2 will be stronger.
* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:** While attraction and repulsion determine the direction of the magnetic force, they don't affect the magnitude (strength).

""Speak of the devil!"" Becky declared when Dirk strolled into the room.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Becky didn't trust Dirk. (1) Becky had just been speaking about Dirk.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an idiom, an expression that cannot be understood literally.
The idiom speak of the devil suggests that Becky had just been speaking about Dirk. People say this when the person they've just been speaking about coincidentally arrives, as if summoned."	"The correct answer is **(1) Becky had just been speaking about Dirk.**

Here's why:

* **The idiom ""speak of the devil"" is a common phrase that signifies the arrival of the person who was just being discussed.** It implies a serendipitous and almost magical coincidence.
* **The context of the sentence reinforces this meaning.** Becky's exclamation, ""Speak of the devil!"" immediately followed by Dirk entering the room, makes it clear that she was talking about him just before his arrival. 

The choice ""(0) Becky didn't trust Dirk"" is not supported by the idiom or the sentence. The idiom doesn't imply distrust, and the sentence lacks any indication of Becky's feelings towards Dirk.

Rain is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you put rainwater into a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space.
The water in a waterfall is a liquid. A liquid can change shape. But it still takes up the same amount of space. As water flows down a waterfall, the water changes shape.
An empty glass is a solid. If someone drops a glass, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own."	"The correct answer is **(2) empty glass**. 

Here's why:

* **Solids** have a definite shape and volume. They don't change shape easily.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**.

The average kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its temperature. The kinetic energy of a particle is given by the formula:

KE = 1/2 * mv^2

where KE is the kinetic energy, m is the mass of the particle, and v is its velocity.

In this case, the particles in sample B have a higher mass than the particles in sample A, but they have the same average speed. Therefore, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy, and thus a higher temperature."	natural science

Rick has naturally straight hair.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: Hint: Some humans are born with naturally straight hair. Others are born with naturally curly hair.
 Solution: Human hair can be naturally straight or naturally curly. Straight and curly are examples of hair texture.
Some people use tools to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally straight hair is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(1) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to their offspring through genes. 
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or personal experiences.

Since Rick was born with straight hair, it's a characteristic determined by his genes, making it an inherited trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 325 liters (1) 325 milliliters
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a can of soda pop is 325 milliliters.
325 liters is too much."	"You are absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) 325 milliliters**. 

Here's why:

* **Liters (L)** are a unit for measuring larger volumes, like the amount of water in a bathtub.
* **Milliliters (mL)** are a much smaller unit, suitable for measuring things like soda cans.

A typical can of soda pop holds about 355 ml, so 325 ml is a reasonable estimate.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) curled ears (1) EE
 Hint: In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele E is for curled ears, and the allele e is for straight ears.
Oliver, an American curl cat from this group, has curled ears. Oliver has two alleles for curled ears.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Oliver's observable version of the ear type trait is curled ears. So, Oliver's phenotype for the ear type trait is curled ears."	"The answer is **(0) curled ears**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical characteristics of an organism, which are determined by its genes.
* **Genotype** refers to the genetic makeup of an organism.
* The information tells us Oliver has curled ears, which is his observable trait. This makes ""curled ears"" his phenotype. 

The information about the alleles (E and e) and Oliver's genotype (having two alleles for curled ears) is important for understanding how he got his phenotype, but the question specifically asks for his phenotype.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) He will save some space. The morning glories will use up less space than the eucalyptus tree would have used up. (1) Pablo will give up the chance to look at the eucalyptus tree. He thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the morning glories.
 Hint: Pablo is deciding whether to plant morning glories or a eucalyptus tree in his backyard. He wants to make his backyard more beautiful. But he also wants to leave space for doing fun things.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Pablo wants or needs:
Pablo will give up the chance to look at the eucalyptus tree. He thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the morning glories."	"The correct answer is **(1) Pablo will give up the chance to look at the eucalyptus tree. He thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the morning glories.**

Here's why:

* **Cost vs. Benefit:**  A cost in economics is something you sacrifice or give up to get something else.  A benefit is something you gain. 
* **Pablo's Decision:** Pablo is choosing between two options: morning glories or a eucalyptus tree.  He wants a beautiful backyard but also wants space for fun activities.
* **The Cost:** Choosing the morning glories means giving up the opportunity to have the eucalyptus tree, which Pablo believes would be more beautiful. This is a cost because he's sacrificing something desirable (the eucalyptus) for something else (the morning glories).

**Option (0) is incorrect** because it describes a benefit of planting morning glories (saving space). It's not a cost, as Pablo is gaining something positive.

mixing sand and water
melting wax
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But mixing sand and water is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Mixing sand and water:** This is a physical change. The sand and water remain the same substances, just mixed together. No new substance is formed.
* **Melting wax:** This is also a physical change. The wax changes from a solid to a liquid state, but its chemical composition remains the same. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes.**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties. This isn't happening in either case.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling.**  While cooling can cause some substances to change state (like water freezing), it's not the primary cause for either mixing sand and water or melting wax. 
* **(3) Both are caused by heating.** Only melting wax is caused by heating. Mixing sand and water can happen at various temperatures.

The other excerpt uses imprecise language (a really long time ago) and conversational language (totally)."	"You are absolutely correct! The first excerpt is much more formal. Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Formal Language:** The first excerpt uses words like ""civilization,"" ""continues,"" and ""influence,"" which are more academic and sophisticated.
* **Precise Language:** It states the time period more precisely (""more than two thousand years ago"") instead of the casual ""a really long time ago.""
* **Avoiding Slang:** ""Totally"" is a slang term and doesn't belong in a formal essay.

**In summary:** The first excerpt demonstrates a better understanding of formal writing style and avoids the casual and imprecise language found in the second excerpt.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles."	"The answer is **(2) Solution A**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
* **Solution A** has 10 pink particles in 35 mL of solvent. 
* **Solution B** has 7 pink particles in 35 mL of solvent. 

Since Solution A has more pink particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a friend who weighs 21 pounds (1) a friend who weighs 23 pounds
 Hint: Chase gives two friends a ride in his wagon. One friend sits in the wagon at a time.
 Solution: Look for the friend who is heavier.
A friend who weighs 23 pounds is heavier than a friend who weighs 21 pounds. So, to move the wagon at the same speed each time, Chase needs to use a larger force to start moving the wagon with a friend who weighs 23 pounds."	"The solution is correct and well-explained. Here's a slightly simplified version:

**Answer:** (1) a friend who weighs 23 pounds

**Explanation:**

The heavier the friend, the more force is needed to move the wagon at the same speed.  Since the friend who weighs 23 pounds is heavier, Chase needs to pull with a larger force.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sticky (1) smooth (2) soft
 Hint: Select the best answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
A soft object changes shape when pressed or squeezed. None of the objects are soft.
A smooth object is not scratchy or rough. All three objects are smooth.
A sticky object can attach or stick to other things. The wooden ruler and the ice hockey rink are not sticky.
The property that all three objects have in common is smooth."	"The answer is **(1) smooth**. 

Here's why:

* **Wooden ruler:**  A wooden ruler is typically smooth to the touch.
* **Ice hockey rink:** An ice hockey rink is covered in smooth ice.
* **Glass bottle:** A glass bottle has a smooth surface.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) climate (1) weather
 Hint: Hint: Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.
 Solution: Read the text carefully.
The wind speed in Patagonia, Argentina, reached 17 kilometers per hour yesterday.
This passage tells you about the wind speed in Patagonia yesterday. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"The correct answer is **(1) weather**. 

Here's why:

* **Weather** refers to the atmospheric conditions at a specific time and location.  The passage describes the wind speed in Patagonia on a particular day.
* **Climate** is the long-term average weather patterns in a region. It's not about a single day's conditions.

2479	2479	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
breaking a plate
water evaporating from a lake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But breaking a plate is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Breaking a plate:** This is a physical change because the composition of the plate (ceramic) remains the same. It's simply broken into smaller pieces. 
* **Water evaporating:** This is a physical change because the water molecules are simply changing state from liquid to gas. The chemical makeup of water (H₂O) doesn't change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can cause evaporation, breaking a plate is usually caused by force.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is directly caused by cooling.
* **(3) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different chemical properties. Neither breaking a plate nor evaporation create new substances.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses slang (ace).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the slang, so it is more formal overall."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Sentence (1) is more formal.**

Here's why:

* **""Ace"" is informal slang:** While it's a common expression, it's considered casual and wouldn't be used in a formal setting like a news article or a professional report.
* **""Excellent"" is more formal:**  It's a more precise and elevated word than ""ace,"" which makes the sentence sound more professional.
* **""Came as no surprise"" is more formal:** This phrase is more commonly used in formal writing than the phrase ""was not surprising,"" which is more conversational.

2509	2509	"Question: Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Mrs. Harrington is kind, and her heart is gold.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metaphor (1) simile
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Mrs. Harrington is kind, and her heart is gold.
The words heart and gold are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"The correct answer is **(0) metaphor**. 

Here's why:

* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly compares two unlike things without using ""like"" or ""as"".  In this case, the sentence is saying that Mrs. Harrington's kindness is like gold, but it's not explicitly stating the comparison with those words.
* **Simile:** A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" to make a comparison.  For example, ""Her heart is like gold"" would be a simile.

Since the sentence states ""her heart is gold"" without using ""like"" or ""as"", it is a **metaphor**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) She will save some space. The sunflowers will use up less space than the juniper tree would have used up. (1) Alexa will give up the chance to look at the juniper tree. She thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the sunflowers.
 Hint: Alexa is deciding whether to plant sunflowers or a juniper tree in her backyard. She wants to make her backyard more beautiful. But she also wants to leave space for doing fun things.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Alexa wants or needs:
Alexa will give up the chance to look at the juniper tree. She thinks it would have looked more beautiful than the sunflowers."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why choice (1) is the cost:

* **Opportunity Cost:**  Choice (1) describes the opportunity cost of planting sunflowers.  This means that by choosing sunflowers, Alexa is giving up the chance to have the juniper tree, which she believes would be more beautiful. This is a cost because she values the beauty of the juniper tree.

* **Cost vs. Benefit:**  A cost is something that is lost or given up in order to get something else. In this scenario, the cost of planting sunflowers is the loss of the opportunity to have the juniper tree. The benefit, on the other hand, would be the beauty of the sunflowers and the space they save.

dust settling out of the air
pouring milk on oatmeal
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Dust settling out of the air:** This is a physical change because the dust particles are simply rearranging themselves.  There's no change in the composition of the dust.
* **Pouring milk on oatmeal:** This is also a physical change. You're just combining two substances, but you're not creating a new substance. The milk and oatmeal retain their individual properties. 

**Key takeaway:** Physical changes involve a change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition.

a piece of apple turning brown
burning a candle
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But a piece of apple turning brown is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **A piece of apple turning brown** is a chemical change because the apple reacts with oxygen in the air, changing its chemical composition. This is called oxidation, and it results in the formation of new substances.
* **Burning a candle** is also a chemical change. The wax and wick react with oxygen, producing heat, light, carbon dioxide, water, and soot. This is a combustion reaction where the original substances are transformed into new ones. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling.**  Cooling is not the cause of either change.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes.** Physical changes alter the appearance of a substance but not its chemical makeup. These changes are chemical.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating.**  While burning is caused by heating, the browning of an apple is not. It's caused by a chemical reaction with oxygen.

2531	2531	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a pseudoscorpion is dispersed by a harlequin beetle?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mutualistic (1) parasitic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Pseudoscorpions are small arachnids that often crawl onto the backs of large beetles, such as harlequin beetles.
When a beetle with a pseudoscorpion on its back flies away, the pseudoscorpion rides along. This ride helps the pseudoscorpion disperse, or move to a new location, much faster and farther than it could on its own.
When the pseudoscorpion is carried along, it does not harm the beetle, but it does not help the beetle, either.
Figure: a pseudoscorpion on the back of a harlequin beetle.
 Solution: When a pseudoscorpion is dispersed by a harlequin beetle, the pseudoscorpion is able to move faster and farther than it could on its own. So, the pseudoscorpion benefits from its relationship with the beetle.
The beetle is not harmed by the pseudoscorpion, but the beetle is not helped, either. So, the beetle is not significantly affected by its relationship with the pseudoscorpion.
Since the pseudoscorpion benefits and the beetle is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when a pseudoscorpion is dispersed by a harlequin beetle."	"The answer is **(2) commensal**. 

Here's why:

* **Commensalism** is a relationship where one organism benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor helped. In this case, the pseudoscorpion benefits by getting a free ride, while the beetle is unaffected.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **Mutualism** is a relationship where both organisms benefit. The beetle doesn't benefit from the pseudoscorpion's presence.
* **Parasitic** is a relationship where one organism benefits at the expense of the other. The pseudoscorpion doesn't harm the beetle.

* **""They"" is unclear:**  The pronoun ""they"" doesn't have a clear antecedent (the noun it refers to) in the sentence. Who is claiming the documentary is one of the best? 
* **Ambiguity:** This lack of clarity creates ambiguity and makes the sentence confusing.

**Choice (1) ""The new documentary, critics claim, is one of the best ever made.""** correctly resolves this issue by replacing ""they"" with the specific noun ""critics.""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) handsaw (1) door (2) air inside a balloon (3) marbles
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: A marble is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A marble can be made of clear or colored glass.
The air inside a balloon is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air inside a balloon expands to fill all the space in the balloon. If the balloon pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.
A handsaw is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. The handle of this handsaw is made of wood, and the blade is made of metal. Both wood and metal are solids.
A door is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you open or close a door, it keeps its shape."	"The correct answer is **(2) air inside a balloon**. 

Here's why:

* **Gases** have no fixed shape or volume. They expand to fill their container. The air inside a balloon is a great example of this.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases.  
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a smaller distance between the magnets (1 inch) compared to Pair 2 (2 inches). Since the distance is smaller in Pair 1, the magnetic force will be stronger.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Fgfr1a1 protein . . . fgfr1a1 gene (1) fgfr1a1 gene . . . Fgfr1a1 protein
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Common carp are a type of fish that have scales on their bodies. The pattern of scales on a common carp is established while the fish is developing inside its egg. During this time, a protein called Fgfr1a1 sends signals to the fish's body that direct the shape and spacing of the fish's scales. The signals from the Fgfr1a1 protein result in common carp with small, evenly spaced scales.
The Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene.
A certain carp had large, patchy scales because of a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene. Compared to the fgfr1a1 gene without a mutation, the mutated fgfr1a1 gene encoded a form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the Fgfr1a1 protein could not send signals to the fish's body.
Figure: common carp with large, patchy scales (top), and small, evenly spaced scales.

 Choices: (0) Austen shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent. (1) Austen shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Austen shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The second text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Austen shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"The correct answer is **(0) Austen shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional sense of ""terribly"":**  In this sentence, ""terribly"" modifies the verb ""shivered,"" conveying a sense of extreme shivering. It implies that Austen was shaking violently due to the cold. 

* **Nontraditional sense of ""terribly"":** In the second sentence, ""terribly"" modifies the adjective ""steep."" It's being used as a synonym for ""extremely,"" which is a less formal and potentially overused way to express intensity.

**Key takeaway:** While both sentences are grammatically correct, the first sentence uses ""terribly"" in a more traditional and preferred way, emphasizing the severity of Austen's shivering.

Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
A rock heating up in a campfire is caused by heating. But sawing a log in half is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Sawing a log in half:** This is a physical change because you are changing the shape and size of the log, but not its chemical composition. It's still wood.
* **A rock heating up in a campfire:** This is also a physical change. The heat increases the rock's temperature, but it doesn't change what the rock is made of. It's still the same type of rock. 

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve creating new substances with different properties. Neither sawing a log nor heating a rock creates a new substance.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Only one change (cooling a substance) is related to cooling.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  This means that as the distance decreases, the force increases significantly.

* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 2 has a smaller distance between the magnets (1.3 cm) compared to Pair 1 (2.8 cm).  

* **Conclusion:** Because of the shorter distance in Pair 2, the magnetic force between those magnets will be stronger even though the magnets in Pair 1 are repelling each other.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mutualistic (1) commensal (2) parasitic
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Acacia ants spend most of their lives on bullhorn acacia trees. Up to 30,000 ants can live together in a colony on one acacia tree!
The ants eat nectar produced by the tree and build nests inside hollowed-out thorns on the tree's branches. The ants also attack insects and other animals that try to eat the tree's leaves. Sometimes the ants leave the tree and destroy nearby plants. This creates open space around the tree. The open space makes it easier for the acacia tree to get resources such as sunlight and water.
Figure: acacia ants feeding on nectar of a bullhorn acacia tree.
 Solution: When acacia ants live on a bullhorn acacia tree, the ants get food and shelter. So, the ants benefit from their relationship with the bullhorn acacia tree.
The ants protect the tree and make it easier for the tree to get resources. So, the bullhorn acacia tree also benefits from its relationship with the ants.
Since both the acacia ants and the bullhorn acacia tree benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when acacia ants live on a bullhorn acacia tree."	"The answer is **(0) mutualistic**. 

Here's why:

* **Mutualistic:** Both organisms benefit from the relationship. The ants get food and shelter from the tree, and the tree gets protection from predators and competition for resources.
* **Commensal:** One organism benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor helped.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have light yellow flowers and others have dark yellow flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for light yellow flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for dark yellow flowers (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dark yellow flowers or light yellow flowers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for light yellow flowers, is dominant over the f allele, which is for dark yellow flowers.
Dark yellow flowers is the recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the flower color trait must have only recessive alleles for the flower color gene. So, offspring with dark yellow flowers must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
Light yellow flowers is the dominant allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the flower color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the flower color gene. So, offspring with light yellow flowers must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dark yellow flowers to offspring with light yellow flowers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dark yellow flowers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with light yellow flowers."	"The correct answer is **(3) 0:4**. 

The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring will have at least one dominant ""F"" allele, resulting in light yellow flowers. There are no boxes with the ""ff"" genotype, which is required for dark yellow flowers.

 Choices: (0) Solution A (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution B
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles."	"The answer is **(0) Solution A**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is about how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 9 pink particles in 35 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 6 pink particles in 35 mL of solvent.

Since Solution A has more pink particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample A**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle

Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,500 m/s). However, sample A has particles with a larger mass (34 u) than sample B (20 u).  

Since the particles in sample A have a greater mass, their kinetic energy (1/2 * mv²) will be higher, resulting in a higher temperature.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(1) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means the closer the magnets, the stronger the force. 
* **Equal Distances:** The diagrams show that the magnets in both Pair 1 and Pair 2 are separated by the same distance (3 inches).
* **Same Material:** Since the magnets are made of the same material, their inherent magnetic properties are the same.

Therefore, with the same distance and the same material, the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair is equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having a graying coat (1) having a graying coat
 Hint: This passage describes the coat graying trait in horses:

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for not having a graying coat (g) is recessive to the allele for having a graying coat (G).
Maverick is a horse from this group. Maverick has the heterozygous genotype Gg for the coat graying gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Maverick's phenotype for the coat graying trait. First, consider the alleles in Maverick's genotype for the coat graying gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for not having a graying coat (g) is recessive to the allele for having a graying coat (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Maverick's genotype of Gg has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Maverick's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be having a graying coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) having a graying coat**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Maverick has the genotype Gg, meaning he has one dominant allele (G) and one recessive allele (g) for the coat graying trait.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant. This means that even with one copy of this allele, the trait will be expressed.
* **Phenotype:** Since Maverick has at least one dominant allele (G), his phenotype will be **having a graying coat**.

 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
Put their dog to sleep is a more indirect way of saying have the veterinarian kill their dog."	"The correct answer is **(0) euphemism**.

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. In this case, ""put their dog to sleep"" is a euphemism for ""euthanize"" or ""have their dog put down.""

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As comfortable as a bed of nails shows verbal irony because sitting on nails would not be comfortable."	"The correct answer is **(1) verbal irony**. 

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something but means the opposite. In this case, the speaker states that the rocking chair is ""as comfortable as a bed of nails,"" which is clearly an exaggeration.  A bed of nails would be incredibly uncomfortable, so the speaker is implying that the chair is actually very uncomfortable.

The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Linda."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Linda.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced Forces:**  The forces acting on Linda are not equal in magnitude. The upward force from the seat (1,200N) is greater than the downward force of gravity (600N). 
* **Net Force:**  Since the forces are unbalanced, there is a net force acting on Linda. This net force is the difference between the two forces (1,200N - 600N = 600N) and is directed upwards. 

**Important Note:** Even though Linda is on a roller coaster, the question specifically states that all *other* forces on Linda are balanced. This means we only need to consider the force of gravity and the force from the seat.

The local government is advising everyone to remove standing water from their backyards, but none of our neighbors are doing it. If our neighbors aren't doing it, then there is no reason we should do it either.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself (1) slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences (2) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that the speaker shouldn't remove standing water from the backyard because none of the speaker's neighbors are doing it. However, this isn't necessarily true. The speaker's neighbors may not be best qualified to know whether it is safe to leave standing water around the home. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as the bandwagon fallacy."	"The correct answer is **(2) bandwagon fallacy**. 

Here's why:

* The speaker is assuming that because their neighbors aren't removing standing water, it must be safe or unnecessary. This is a classic example of the bandwagon fallacy – the belief that something must be right or acceptable simply because a lot of people are doing it. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) circular reasoning:** This fallacy involves using the claim itself as evidence. The text doesn't do this.
* **(1) slippery slope fallacy:** This fallacy argues that a small action will lead to a chain of negative consequences. The text doesn't make this kind of argument.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rough fur (1) soft fur
 Hint: In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f).
Gruff is a dachshund dog from this group. Gruff has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.
 Solution: Gruff's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Gruff's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Gruff's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Gruff's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Gruff's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Gruff's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur."	"The correct answer is **(1) soft fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Gruff's genotype is **ff**, meaning he has two copies of the recessive allele for soft fur.
* **Dominance:** The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means that an individual needs two copies of the recessive allele (ff) to express the soft fur trait.
* **Phenotype:** Since Gruff has the homozygous recessive genotype (ff), his phenotype will be **soft fur**.

 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

In plants such as the European cantaloupe, fruit ripening is affected by a substance called ethylene (ETH-uh-leen). Ethylene is made inside a plant's cells with the help of a protein called CmACO1. The CmACO1 protein is encoded by the CmACO1 gene.
A certain European cantaloupe plant had a mutation in its CmACO1 gene. Compared to the CmACO1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CmACO1 gene encoded a form of the CmACO1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the CmACO1 protein could make only a small amount of ethylene. The fruits of this plant took longer to ripen than fruits from plants containing more ethylene. Farmers found this mutation useful because the fruit stayed good for a longer period of time after harvest.

* **(0) uses ""terribly"" in a more colloquial, intensified sense, meaning ""extremely"" or ""very.""**  The slope is described as ""terribly steep,"" which while not grammatically incorrect, is less precise and more common in casual language.

The distinction is subtle, but the traditional sense of ""terribly"" emphasizes the negative aspect of the action, making it a more accurate and impactful descriptor in this context.

I've heard that Suzie & Co. is downsizing, so I'm happy to see that their store in downtown Greenville will remain open for now.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) euphemism (1) hyperbole
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
Downsizing is an indirect way of saying that the company is planning on firing employees, closing shops or branches, and/or reducing its budget."	"The correct answer is **(0) euphemism**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. ""Downsizing"" is a euphemism for the potentially harsh reality of layoffs or business closures. 

* **Hyperbole:** Hyperbole is an exaggeration used for emphasis or effect. This is not present in the text. 

The text uses ""downsizing"" to soften the impact of the news about Suzie & Co. potentially laying off employees or closing stores. This makes it a clear example of a euphemism.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the Bible (1) ancient legend
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion Scheherazade is ancient legend.
The Arabian Nights presents the ancient legend of how Scheherazade successfully postpones her imminent death by mesmerizing her captor with a thousand and one fascinating tales.
The allusion Scheherazade means a person who uses his or her arts to distract someone and avoid consequences."	"The answer is **(1) ancient legend**.

The allusion to Scheherazade comes from *The Arabian Nights*, a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales. Scheherazade is the clever storyteller who, by captivating the Sultan with her stories, delays her execution night after night.

2636	2636	"Question: Assume all other forces on Edward are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Edward?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Edward. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Edward.
 Hint: Edward is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Edward with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Edward with a force of 400N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Edward, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Edward down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Edward up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Edward."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Edward.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:**  When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out.  This means that the forces are equal in magnitude (strength) and opposite in direction.
* **Edward's Situation:**  Gravity is pulling Edward down with 400N, while the diving board is pushing him up with 400N. These forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, making them balanced.
* **Net Force:**  Since the forces are balanced, there is no net force acting on Edward. This means he is not accelerating (either speeding up or slowing down).

 Hint: Figure: Białowieża Forest.
The Białowieża Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in Poland and Belarus.
 Solution: A temperate deciduous forest is a type of ecosystem. Temperate deciduous forests have the following features: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. So, the Białowieża Forest has soil that is rich in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees."	"The answer is **(1) It has soil that is rich in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees.** 

Here's why:

* **Temperate Deciduous Forests:** The Białowieża Forest is a prime example of a temperate deciduous forest. These forests are characterized by their rich soil, which is due to the decomposition of fallen leaves and other organic matter. 
* **Limited Tree Diversity:** While these forests have a rich understory of plants, they typically have a smaller number of dominant tree species compared to tropical rainforests. This is often due to the seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation, which favor certain tree adaptations.

The city of Livingston is currently experiencing a minor crisis. Its sanitation workers are on strike, and the garbage is piling up in the streets.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) paradox (1) oxymoron
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an oxymoron, a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Minor crisis is a contradiction, because minor means small or insignificant, and a crisis is a large problem."	"The correct answer is **(1) oxymoron**. 

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron:** A figure of speech that combines contradictory terms, creating a surprising and thought-provoking effect.  ""Minor crisis"" is an oxymoron because a crisis is typically a major event, not a minor one.

Let's break down why the other options aren't correct:

* **Paradox:** A statement that seems contradictory but may be true. While the situation described is unusual, it's not a true paradox. 

The text effectively uses the oxymoron ""minor crisis"" to highlight the irony of the situation.  Even though the sanitation strike is causing a problem, it's being labeled as ""minor,"" which adds a layer of humor and potentially downplays the seriousness of the situation.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trifluoride is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethane contains three symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, and F for fluorine. So, fluoromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for xenon contains one symbol: Xe. So, xenon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, xenon is an elementary substance."	"The correct answer is **(1) xenon (Xe)**. 

Here's why:

* **Elementary substances** are made up of only one type of atom.
* **Xenon (Xe)** is a noble gas and exists as a single atom in its elemental form.
* **Boron trifluoride (BF3)** and **fluoromethane (CH3F)** are both **compounds**, meaning they are made up of multiple elements bonded together.

 Hint: This passage describes the flower position trait in pea plants:

In a group of pea plants, some individuals have axial flowers and others have terminal flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower position trait has two alleles. The allele F is for axial flowers, and the allele f is for terminal flowers.
A certain pea plant from this group has terminal flowers. This plant has two alleles for terminal flowers.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The pea plant has two alleles for terminal flowers (f). So, the plant's genotype for the flower position gene is ff."	"The correct answer is **(0) ff**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The genotype refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a particular gene.
* **Alleles:**  Alleles are different versions of a gene. In this case, the flower position gene has two alleles:
    * **F:**  Axial flowers
    * **f:** Terminal flowers
* **The plant has terminal flowers:** This means it must have two copies of the 'f' allele, as it's recessive and needs two copies to be expressed. 

Therefore, the plant's genotype is **ff**.

The idiom speak of the devil suggests that Abigail had just been speaking about Craig. People say this when the person they've just been speaking about coincidentally arrives, as if summoned."	"The correct answer is **(1) Abigail had just been speaking about Craig.** 

Here's why:

* **The idiom ""speak of the devil"" is a common phrase used when someone you've just been talking about appears.** It's like the person you were discussing suddenly materialized out of thin air. 
* **The text clearly states that Craig ""strolled into the room"" after Abigail said ""speak of the devil,""** indicating that his arrival was unexpected and coincidental.

 Hint: Scarlett is deciding whether to make onion soup or vegetable soup for dinner. She wants dinner to be as tasty as possible. But she is also hungry and wants to eat soon.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Scarlett wants or needs:
Scarlett will give up the chance to eat the onion soup, which would have been tastier than the vegetable soup."	"You are absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) Scarlett will give up the chance to eat the onion soup, which would have been tastier than the vegetable soup.**

Here's why:

* **Opportunity Cost:**  In economics, a cost is often represented by an opportunity cost. This means the value of the best alternative that you give up when making a choice. 
* **Scarlett's Decision:** Scarlett is choosing between making vegetable soup and onion soup. By choosing vegetable soup, she is giving up the opportunity to enjoy the tastier onion soup. This is the cost of her decision.

**Let's analyze why option (0) is incorrect:**

* **Saving Time:** While saving time is a benefit of making vegetable soup, it doesn't represent a cost in the traditional economic sense.  It's a positive outcome, not a sacrifice.

an iceberg melting slowly
cooking a pancake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
An iceberg melting is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. An iceberg is made of frozen water. As it melts, the water changes from a solid to a liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
An iceberg melting is a physical change. But cooking a pancake is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. But an iceberg melting is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Iceberg melting:** Icebergs melt because they are exposed to warmer temperatures. The heat energy causes the ice molecules to vibrate faster, breaking the bonds that hold them in a solid state.
* **Cooking a pancake:**  Cooking pancakes involves applying heat to the batter. This heat causes chemical reactions to occur within the batter, changing its composition and forming a solid, cooked pancake. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  This is incorrect because cooking a pancake is a chemical change.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:** This is incorrect because melting an iceberg is a physical change.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** This is incorrect because both changes are caused by applying heat.

2663	2663	"Question: Which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of blue particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same."	"The answer is **(1) neither; their concentrations are the same**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is about the amount of solute (the blue particles) dissolved in a given amount of solvent.
* **Solution A** has 15 blue particles in 40 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** also has 15 blue particles in 40 mL of solvent. 

Since they have the same number of solute particles in the same volume of solvent, their concentrations are equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 3:1
 Hint: This passage describes the coat pattern trait in cheetahs:
A cheetah with a spotted coat has many small black spots on its body. A cheetah with a king coat has large black splotches on its body and stripes on its back. King cheetahs are rarely seen in the wild. They were once thought to be a different species.
In a group of cheetahs, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a king coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a king coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a spotted coat (A).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cheetahs.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a king coat or a spotted coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for a king coat, is recessive to the A allele, which is for a spotted coat.
A king coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cheetah with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a king coat must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
A spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cheetah with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a king coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a king coat. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a spotted coat."	"The answer is **(3) 0:4**. 

The Punnett square shows that all offspring will have the genotype AA or Aa, meaning they will all have a spotted coat. There is no possibility for offspring to inherit the recessive aa genotype, which is required for the king coat.

Isaiah has naturally dark skin.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: Hint: Humans are born with their skin color.
 Solution: Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Isaiah's skin color is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(1) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Skin color is determined by the genes we inherit.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences. 

Since Isaiah was born with dark skin, this means he inherited the genes that determine that trait from his parents.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1. (1) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 2 has a larger distance between the magnets (3 inches) compared to Pair 1 (2 inches).

Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 is weaker than the force between the magnets in Pair 1.

cracking open a peanut
butter melting on a hot day
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Cracking open a peanut is a physical change. The peanut shell breaks and the peanut falls out. Both are still made of the same type of matter.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But cracking open a peanut is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Cracking a peanut** is a physical change because it only alters the peanut's shape and size. The peanut itself remains the same chemically.
* **Butter melting** is also a physical change. It's a change of state (solid to liquid) but the chemical composition of the butter remains the same. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling.**  This is incorrect.  Melting is caused by heating.
* **(1) Both are chemical changes.** This is incorrect.  Physical changes don't alter the chemical makeup of a substance. 
* **(2) Both are caused by heating.** This is partially correct for butter melting but incorrect for cracking a peanut.

2698	2698	"Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnet Size:** The strength of a magnetic field, and therefore the magnetic force it exerts, is directly related to the size of the magnet. Larger magnets have stronger fields.
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:**  In Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than in Pair 2.  Since the other magnet (Magnet A) is the same size in both pairs, the smaller Magnet B in Pair 1 will produce a weaker magnetic field.
* **Attraction/Repulsion:** While the direction of the force (attraction or repulsion) depends on the poles facing each other, it doesn't affect the magnitude of the force itself. 

Therefore, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 due to the smaller size of Magnet B.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle

Since the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A, and they have the same mass, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy, meaning it has a higher temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution A (2) Solution B
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles."	"The answer is **(2) Solution B**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is the amount of solute dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 10 blue particles in 50 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 15 blue particles in 50 mL of solvent.

Since Solution B has more blue particles (solute) in the same amount of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Tom can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Tom can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is the fallacy of judging someone based on the actions or characteristics of their associates. In this case, the speaker is trying to discredit Tom by linking him to his uncle's criminal past. 
* **Straw man** is a fallacy where someone distorts or misrepresents their opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. This is not happening in the text.

The speaker is using Tom's uncle's actions to imply Tom's untrustworthiness, even though there is no evidence that Tom himself is untrustworthy. This is a classic example of guilt by association.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: All three pencils have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 71°F pencil is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) a pencil at a temperature of 71°F**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a system due to its temperature.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance.
* **Higher temperature = higher average kinetic energy = more thermal energy**.

Since all the pencils are identical except for their temperature, the one with the highest temperature (71°F) will have the most thermal energy.

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  The average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature. 
* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle 
* **The Samples:** Both samples have particles with the same mass (46 u) and the same average speed (1,500 m/s). Since these factors are identical, their average kinetic energies will be the same.

 Solution: Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each sailboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each sailboat moved for 5 hours. The sailboat that moved 45 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"The answer is **(0) a sailboat that moved 45 kilometers south in 5 hours**. 

Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time.** 
* All three sailboats traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours).
* The sailboat that traveled 45 kilometers covered the shortest distance in that time. 

Since it covered the least distance in the same time as the others, it must have been moving at the slowest speed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Higher kinetic energy means higher temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass
    * v = velocity (speed)
* **Comparing the Samples:** Both samples have the same average speed (1,200 m/s). However, the particles in Sample A have a higher mass (36 u) than the particles in Sample B (32 u).  Since the mass is greater in Sample A, their average kinetic energy will be higher.

**Therefore, sample A has the higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder glass of milk (1) the hotter glass of milk
 Hint: Two 125-gram glasses of milk are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two glasses of milk are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter glass of milk has more thermal energy."	"The answer is **(1) the hotter glass of milk**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of a system due to its temperature. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy the system possesses.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system.  
* Since the two glasses of milk have the same mass and composition, the hotter glass has particles moving faster (higher kinetic energy), meaning it has more thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bath towel with less thermal energy (1) the bath towel with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two 525-gram bath towels are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two bath towels are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the bath towel with less thermal energy has a lower temperature."	"The answer is **(0) the bath towel with less thermal energy**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:** Thermal energy is the total energy of the molecules within a substance. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those molecules. 
* **Relationship:**  A higher thermal energy means the molecules are moving faster on average, leading to a higher temperature. Conversely, a lower thermal energy means slower molecular movement and a lower temperature. 

Since the two towels are identical in material and mass, the one with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Size:** The strength of a magnetic force is directly related to the size of the magnets. Larger magnets have a stronger magnetic field, resulting in a larger magnetic force.
* **Comparison:**  In the given pairs, the rectangular magnet (the one that's the same in both pairs) is larger than the circular magnet in both cases. However, the circular magnet in Pair 2 is significantly smaller than the circular magnet in Pair 1.
* **Conclusion:** Since the circular magnet in Pair 2 is smaller, its magnetic force will be weaker, leading to a smaller overall magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.  This means that as the distance between the magnets increases, the magnetic force decreases rapidly. 
* **Comparing the Pairs:** In Pair 1, the magnets are 9 mm apart, while in Pair 2, they are 21 mm apart. Since Pair 1 has a smaller distance between the magnets, the magnetic force between them will be stronger.

The second text uses peruse in its nontraditional sense: to look through in a casual manner.
Before returning to the stockroom, Ronald briefly perused the nails in the hardware aisle to see if anything needed to be restocked.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word peruse because it is considered more standard."	"The correct answer is **(1) Ronald perused the nails in the hardware aisle for almost an hour, trying to figure out which type would be best for his project.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional ""Peruse""**:  Means to examine something carefully and thoroughly. This is what's happening in choice (1). Ronald is spending a significant amount of time (almost an hour) trying to decide which nails are best.
* **Nontraditional ""Peruse""**:  Sometimes used to mean a casual look-over, which is closer to the meaning of ""glance"" or ""skim."" This is what's happening in choice (0). Ronald is simply checking to see if anything needs restocking, not trying to find the best type.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Beating an egg is a physical change. Beating an egg mixes together the egg white, egg yolk, and some air. But mixing them together does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Shaking up salad dressing:** This is a physical change because you're simply mixing the ingredients. The components of the dressing (oil, vinegar, etc.) remain the same, just in a different arrangement.
* **Beating an egg:** This is also a physical change. You're changing the egg's texture by incorporating air, but you're not altering the chemical composition of the egg itself. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** Neither change involves heating.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:** Neither change involves cooling.
* **(3) Both are chemical changes:**  A chemical change would create a new substance.  In both cases, the ingredients are still the same, just rearranged.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(1) sample A**. 
 
The kinetic energy of a particle is given by the equation $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$, where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $v$ is its velocity. Since the particles in sample A have a higher average velocity, they will have a higher average kinetic energy.  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system. Therefore, sample A has a higher temperature."	natural science

 Choices: (0) Solution A (1) Solution B (2) neither; their concentrations are the same
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of green particles."	"The answer is **(1) Solution B**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 5 green particles in 40 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 12 green particles in 40 mL of solvent.

Since Solution B has more solute particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

Where evermore no green life shoots. (1) The human heart has hidden treasures,
In secret kept, in silence sealed;
The thoughts, the hopes, the dreams, the pleasures,
Whose charms were broken if revealed.
 Hint: From Charlotte Brontë, ""Evening Solace"" and from Gordon Bottomley, ""To Iron-Founders and Others""
 Solution: This poem uses alliteration. It repeats beginning consonant sounds.
Whose charms were broken if revealed."	"The solution is incorrect. The poem that uses alliteration is **(0) When you destroy a blade of grass**. 

Here's why:

* **Alliteration** is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words close together. 

Let's analyze the lines:

* **""When you destroy a blade of grass""**  -  The ""b"" sound in ""blade"" and ""grass"" is repeated.
* **""You poison England at her roots""** - The ""p"" sound in ""poison"" and ""roots"" is repeated.
* **""Remember no man's foot can pass""** - The ""m"" sound in ""man's"" and ""foot"" is repeated.
* **""Where evermore no green life shoots.""** - The ""g"" sound in ""green"" and ""life"" is repeated.

While the other poem (""The human heart has hidden treasures..."") has some repetition of sounds, it doesn't consistently use alliteration throughout the lines like the first poem does.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	The answer is (2).  The average kinetic energy of a particle is given by KE = (1/2)mv², where m is the particle's mass and v is its speed.  Since the particles in both samples have the same mass and average speed, they have the same average kinetic energy.  The temperature of a substance is a measure of the average kinetic energy of its particles.  Since the samples have the same average kinetic energy, they have the same temperature.	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Johnny can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Johnny can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is the fallacy of assuming someone is guilty or untrustworthy because they are associated with someone else who is guilty or untrustworthy. The text directly uses this logic:  ""Didn't you hear that his uncle was imprisoned for embezzling $1.5 million?""  It attempts to discredit Johnny based on his uncle's actions, even though there's no evidence Johnny is like his uncle.

* **Bandwagon fallacy** is when someone argues that something is true or good because many people believe it or do it. This isn't present in the text.

 Solution: The text uses assonance, the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words.
The words age, rave, day, and rage share a vowel sound."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(0) assonance**. 

Here's a breakdown of why:

* **Assonance:** The repetition of vowel sounds within a phrase or sentence. In this case, the repetition of the short ""a"" sound in ""age,"" ""rave,"" ""day,"" and ""rage"" creates a distinct sonic effect.

* **Apostrophe:**  A figure of speech where a speaker directly addresses someone or something absent, dead, or inanimate. While the poem uses a strong emotional tone, it doesn't directly address a specific absent person or thing.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has many different types of organisms. (1) It has warm, wet summers.
 Hint: Figure: Sahara Desert.
The Sahara Desert in northern Africa is the largest hot desert in the world. Less than one-fifth of this desert is covered in sand dunes. Most of the Sahara Desert is covered by bare rock, gravel, and pebbles!
 Solution: A hot desert is a type of ecosystem. Hot deserts have the following features: a small amount of rain, dry, thin soil, and many different types of organisms. So, the following statements describe the Sahara Desert ecosystem: a small amount of rain, dry, thin soil, and many different types of organisms. It has many different types of organisms. It has a small amount of rain. The following statement does not describe the Sahara Desert: a small amount of rain, dry, thin soil, and many different types of organisms. It has warm, wet summers."	"The answer is **(0) It has many different types of organisms.** 

Here's why:

* **Deserts are diverse:** While deserts are known for harsh conditions, they still support a variety of life adapted to the arid environment. This includes plants like cacti, animals like camels, and insects that have evolved specific survival strategies.
* **Warm, wet summers are not typical:** The Sahara Desert is characterized by extremely high temperatures and very low rainfall, making ""warm, wet summers"" incorrect.

 Choices: (0) Tammy knew the answer to the question, so she raised her hand. (1) China grows most of the wheat in the world.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two simple sentences joined by a comma and the conjunction so.
Tammy knew the answer to the question, so she raised her hand."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Here's why:**

* **Compound Sentence Definition:** A compound sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses (complete sentences that can stand alone) joined together by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" ""so,"" etc.).

* **Analyzing the Sentences:**
    * **Choice (0):**  ""Tammy knew the answer to the question"" is an independent clause. ""She raised her hand"" is also an independent clause. They are joined by the conjunction ""so."" This makes it a **compound sentence**.
    * **Choice (1):**  ""China grows most of the wheat in the world"" is a single independent clause. It's a complete thought and doesn't have another clause joined to it. This makes it a **simple sentence**.

**Therefore, the correct answer is (0).**

2809	2809	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a yellow ground spot (1) a white ground spot
 Hint: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:

In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g).
A certain watermelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the ground spot color gene.
 Solution: The watermelon plant's genotype for the ground spot color gene is gg. The watermelon plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for a white ground spot. So, the watermelon plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait must be a white ground spot.
To check this answer, consider whether the watermelon plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The watermelon plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the watermelon plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait must be a white ground spot."	"The correct answer is **(1) a white ground spot**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype ""gg"", meaning it has two copies of the recessive ""g"" allele.
* **Recessive Allele:** The ""g"" allele is responsible for the white ground spot trait.
* **Phenotype:** Since the plant only has recessive alleles, its phenotype (observable trait) will be the one associated with the recessive allele, which is a white ground spot.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the surroundings . . . each cake (1) each cake . . . the surroundings
 Hint: Edgar baked two identical cakes. When he took them out of the oven, he left one cake in its pan and took the other cake out of its pan to put it on a plate. This table shows how the temperature of each cake changed over 5minutes.
 Solution: The temperature of each cake decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each cake decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each cake to the surroundings."	"The answer is **(1) each cake . . . the surroundings**.

Here's why:

* **Heat Transfer:** Heat always flows from a warmer object to a cooler object.
* **Cake Temperature:** Both cakes had a decrease in temperature, indicating a loss of thermal energy.
* **Surroundings:** The surroundings (the air and the plate or pan) are likely cooler than the hot cakes.

Therefore, the thermal energy transferred from the warmer cakes to the cooler surroundings.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	The answer is (1).	natural science

 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a bathroom sink is 9 liters.
9 milliliters is too little."	"You are absolutely right! The correct answer is **(1) 9 liters**. 

Here's why:

* **Milliliters (ml)** are very small units of volume, typically used for measuring liquids like medicine or a small cup of water.
* **Liters (L)** are much larger and are commonly used for measuring the volume of containers like a bottle of water or, in this case, a bathroom sink.

The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Solution: Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right."

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Feeling overjoyed has a more positive connotation. If you feel overjoyed, you are really glad."	"The solution is correct. **""Feeling overjoyed""** has a more positive connotation than **""feeling glad.""** 

Here's why:

* **Overjoyed** implies a heightened state of happiness, almost overwhelming in its intensity. It suggests a feeling of great joy and excitement.
* **Glad** is a more general term for happiness, indicating a positive feeling but not necessarily one of extreme intensity.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses personification, giving human characteristics to nonhuman things.
Glared at him suggests that it bothered Kenny that the essay wasn't finished. The essay is like a person who is bothering Kenny."	"The correct answer is **(0) It bothered Kenny that the essay wasn't finished.**

Here's why:

* **Personification:** The text uses personification by giving the essay the human ability to ""glare.""  This is a figurative language technique that helps us understand Kenny's feelings.
* **Meaning:** The ""glare"" of the essay suggests that Kenny is feeling bothered or pressured by the unfinished work. It's like the essay is staring at him accusingly, reminding him of his task. 

The choice **(1) The essay was printed in large type** is incorrect. While large type might make something more noticeable, it doesn't explain the feeling of being ""glared at.""  The personification focuses on the emotional impact of the essay, not its physical appearance.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	The answer is (2).	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force Factors:** The strength of the magnetic force depends on:
    * **Strength of the magnets:**  Both pairs use magnets made of the same material.
    * **Distance between magnets:** Both pairs have the same distance (4 inches) between the magnets.
    * **Orientation of poles:**  While the poles are oriented differently (attracting in Pair 2, repelling in Pair 1), this only affects the direction of the force, not its magnitude. 

Since the key factors affecting the force's strength are the same in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force is equal.

 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a watering can is 6 liters.
6 milliliters is too little."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(1) 6 liters**.

Here's why:

* **Milliliters (ml)** are very small units of volume, typically used for measuring liquids like medicine or small amounts of water.
* **Liters (L)** are a much larger unit of volume, often used for measuring larger quantities of liquids like water in a jug or a watering can.

burning a marshmallow over a campfire
an engine using gasoline to power a car
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.
An engine using gasoline to power a car is a chemical change. High temperatures in the engine break the chemical bonds in the molecules of gasoline and release energy. The atoms then link together to form new molecules, such as water, carbon dioxide, and other chemicals.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are caused by heating**. 

Here's why:

* **Burning a marshmallow:**  The heat from the campfire causes the marshmallow to undergo chemical reactions, changing its composition and creating new substances (like ash and burnt sugar).
* **Engine using gasoline:**  The engine uses heat to ignite the gasoline, causing a chemical reaction that releases energy to power the car. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  This is incorrect. Both processes involve heating.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:** This is incorrect. Both processes involve chemical changes, altering the composition of the substances involved.

"The correct answer is **(1) Ernest will give up the chance to be in the Photography Club. He would have had more fun in the Photography Club than in the Theater Club.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:**  A cost in economics is something you give up when you make a choice. 
* **Ernest's Choice:** Ernest is choosing between the Theater Club and the Photography Club.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By choosing the Theater Club, Ernest is giving up the opportunity to be in the Photography Club.  This is the opportunity cost of his decision.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The euphemism big-boned suggests that Hunter is overweight."	"The correct answer is **(0) Hunter is overweight.**

Here's why:

* **Euphemisms:** Euphemisms are used to soften or avoid using direct language that might be considered offensive or uncomfortable. In this case, ""big-boned"" is a euphemism for ""overweight"".
* **Context:** The text states that Hunter shops in the men's department despite being in middle school. This implies that he is larger than his peers and likely needs larger clothing sizes, which is consistent with being overweight.

The phrase ""big-boned"" is not a scientifically accurate term. While bone density can vary, it's unlikely to cause someone to need clothing sizes typically associated with adults.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a golden body (1) a gray body
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b).
Sandy is a guppy from this group. Sandy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.
 Solution: Sandy's genotype for the body color gene is bb. Sandy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a golden body. So, Sandy's phenotype for the body color trait must be a golden body.
To check this answer, consider whether Sandy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Sandy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sandy's phenotype for the body color trait must be a golden body."	"The answer is **(0) a golden body**. 

Here's why:

* **Sandy's genotype is bb:** This means she has two recessive alleles for body color.
* **Recessive alleles only show up in the phenotype when there are two copies:** Since Sandy has two 'b' alleles, her phenotype will be determined by the recessive 'b' allele, which codes for a golden body. 
* **The dominant allele (B) is not present:**  Even though the dominant allele (B) for a gray body exists, it's not present in Sandy's genotype. 

Therefore, Sandy's phenotype for body color is a golden body.

Reggie has naturally red hair.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: Hint: Some people dye their hair. But this does not change their natural hair color.
 Solution: Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Instead, children get their natural hair color from their parents. So, Reggie's hair color is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(1) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Hair color is determined by specific genes.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during an organism's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences. While Reggie might dye his hair, his natural hair color is not an acquired trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a car that moved 505kilometers east in 5hours (1) a car that moved 355kilometers north in 5hours (2) a car that moved 300kilometers north in 5hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each car moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each car moved for 5 hours. The car that moved 505 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at the highest speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) a car that moved 505 kilometers east in 5 hours**. 

Here's why:

* **Speed is calculated by distance divided by time.** 
* All three cars traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours).
* The car that traveled 505 kilometers covered the greatest distance in that time. 

Therefore, this car must have been moving at the highest speed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Attraction vs. Repulsion:**  The direction of the magnetic force (attraction or repulsion) depends on the poles facing each other. But, it doesn't affect the strength of the force.
* **Factors Affecting Force:**  The main factors affecting the magnitude of the magnetic force between magnets are:
    * **Strength of the magnets:** Both pairs have magnets made of the same material, so their strength is assumed to be equal.
    * **Distance between the magnets:** The distance is 4.5 inches in both pairs.
    * **Size of the magnets:** The magnets in both pairs have the same size.

Since all these factors are the same in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same.

 Hint: Two 225-gram glasses of orange juice are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Solution: The two glasses of orange juice are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the glass of orange juice with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) the glass of orange juice with more thermal energy**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a system due to its temperature. The higher the thermal energy, the higher the temperature.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  
* **Mass and material** are important factors in determining how much thermal energy is needed to raise the temperature of a substance, but the question already states these factors are the same. 

Since the glasses of orange juice are identical in mass and material, the only difference is their thermal energy.  The glass with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature.

an antacid tablet reacting with water
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change. When the tablet touches water, the type of matter in the tablet changes and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas makes the water fizz.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But an antacid tablet reacting with water is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Cooking an egg:**  The heat alters the proteins in the egg, causing them to solidify and change texture. This is a chemical change because the egg's composition is permanently altered. You can't easily reverse this process to get back raw egg. 
* **Antacid tablet reacting with water:** The antacid tablet reacts with water, breaking down into new substances and releasing carbon dioxide gas. This is a chemical change because the tablet's composition is transformed, and new substances are formed.

**Let's eliminate the other options:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While cooking an egg requires heat, the antacid tablet reaction is triggered by water, not heat.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:** This is incorrect as both processes involve changes in the chemical makeup of the substances.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** Neither process is primarily caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Desmond. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond.
 Hint: Desmond is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Desmond with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Desmond with a force of 400N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Desmond, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Desmond down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Desmond up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Desmond.** 

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:** When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out. In this case, the downward force of gravity (400N) is exactly countered by the upward force of the diving board (400N).
* **Net Force:**  Net force is the overall force acting on an object. When forces are balanced, the net force is zero.

Since there is no net force on Desmond, he remains stationary on the diving board.

The second text uses random in its nontraditional sense: odd or out of place.
Estelle made a random trip to the grocery store, though her kitchen was already stocked with a hodgepodge of food.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word random because it is generally considered incorrect."	"The correct answer is **(0) At the grocery store, Estelle hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional sense of ""random"":**  In this sentence, ""random"" means Estelle picked fruits and vegetables without any specific plan or order. She was selecting them haphazardly.

* **Nontraditional sense of ""random"":**  In sentence (1), ""random"" implies that Estelle's trip was unexpected or unusual, not that she was choosing items without a pattern.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
A rock heating up in a campfire is caused by heating. But mixing sand and water is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Mixing sand and water:** This is a physical change. The sand and water remain the same substances, just mixed together. You can separate them by letting the water evaporate.
* **A rock heating up in a campfire:** This is also a physical change.  The rock's temperature increases, but its composition remains the same. It's still the same type of rock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While the rock heating up is caused by heating, mixing sand and water isn't.
* **(1) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. Neither of these changes create new substances.

 Solution: The text uses a metaphor, comparing two things that are not actually alike without using like or as.
The metaphor the only light in the sea of darkness was the prospect of pursuing a new career suggests that there was a benefit to Connor's job loss. A light would be beneficial in helping someone escape a dark, difficult-to-navigate situation. Similarly, Connor's new career was beneficial in helping him escape the emotionally difficult experience of losing his job."	"The correct answer is **(1) There was a benefit to Connor's job loss.**

Here's why:

* **Metaphor:** The text uses the metaphor ""the only light in the sea of darkness"" to describe the prospect of a new career.  
* **Interpretation:**  The metaphor directly compares the new career to a light in a sea of darkness. This implies that while losing his job was a negative and overwhelming experience (the darkness), the possibility of a new career offered a positive and hopeful way forward (the light).

The seat of the cart is pushing Francesca up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Francesca."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Francesca.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced Forces:**  When forces acting on an object are not equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they are considered unbalanced. This means there's a net force, resulting in a change in motion.
* **Net Force:** The net force is the overall force acting on an object after considering all individual forces. It's calculated by adding the forces together, taking into account their directions.
* **Francesca's Situation:**  The downward force of gravity (600 N) and the upward force from the seat (1200 N) are not equal. The upward force is greater. This means there's a net upward force on Francesca, causing her to accelerate upwards.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:
Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the e allele, which is for dumbo ears, is recessive to the E allele, which is for normal ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ee. This box is highlighted below.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 1:3. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 1 offspring with dumbo ears for every 3 offspring with normal ears."	"The answer is **(1) 1:3**. 

The explanation provided clearly states that the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 1:3, based on the analysis of the Punnett square.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution A (1) Solution B (2) neither; their concentrations are the same
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same."	"The answer is (2) neither; their concentrations are the same. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 5 pink particles in 20 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** also has 5 pink particles in 20 mL of solvent.

Since both solutions have the same number of particles in the same volume, their concentrations are equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) salty (1) scratchy (2) sweet
 Hint: Select the best answer.
 Solution: Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
Sugar has a sweet taste. All three objects are sweet.
A scratchy object is rough and itchy against your skin. The pineapple is scratchy, but the cake batter and the jello are not.
Potato chips have a salty taste. None of the objects are salty.
The property that all three objects have in common is sweet."	"The answer is **(2) sweet**. 

Here's why:

* **Cake batter:** Cake batter is typically sweet due to the sugar added.
* **Pineapple:** Pineapples are naturally sweet fruits.
* **Jello:** Jello is made with sugar and is therefore sweet. 

The other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) salty:** None of the items are inherently salty.

Shawna has a scar on her right hand.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.
 Solution: Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait."	"The answer is **(0) acquired**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Examples include eye color, hair color, and certain predispositions to diseases.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences. Scars are a perfect example of this.

Since Shawna's scar is a result of an injury, it is not something she inherited from her parents.

 Choices: (0) Tomorrow's lunar eclipse promises to be an impressive sight. (1) Tomorrow's lunar eclipse is going to knock your socks off.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses an idiom (knock your socks off).
The second sentence uses formal language in place of the idiom, so it is more formal overall."	"You've got it exactly right! 

**Sentence (0) ""Tomorrow's lunar eclipse promises to be an impressive sight"" is more formal.**

Here's why:

* **Formal language:** It uses precise and elevated vocabulary (""promises"", ""impressive sight"").
* **Avoidance of idioms:** It doesn't use casual phrases like ""knock your socks off"".

**Sentence (1) ""Tomorrow's lunar eclipse is going to knock your socks off"" is less formal.**

 Hint: Figure: Tibetan Plateau.
The Tibetan Plateau is a tundra ecosystem located in Tibet, western China, and northern India.
 Solution: A tundra is a type of ecosystem. Tundras have the following features: long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants. So, the Tibetan Plateau has long, cold winters. It also has mostly small plants."	"The answer is **(0) It has long, cold winters. It also has mostly small plants.** 

Here's why:

* **Tundra Ecosystems:** The Tibetan Plateau is classified as a tundra ecosystem. Tundras are known for their extremely cold temperatures, permafrost (permanently frozen ground), and limited plant life.

* **Evergreen Trees:** Evergreen trees are not typical of tundra environments. They require warmer temperatures and more moisture than tundras can provide. 

* **Small Plants:**  Tundra vegetation is dominated by small, low-growing plants like grasses, mosses, lichens, and dwarf shrubs. These plants are adapted to survive the harsh conditions.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two cups of black tea have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 110°F cup of black tea is colder than the 195°F cup of black tea, it has less thermal energy."	"The correct answer is **(1) a 350-gram cup of black tea at a temperature of 110°F**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.

The higher the temperature, the more the particles are moving and the more thermal energy the object has. Since the 110°F cup of tea is colder, its particles are moving slower, and therefore it has less thermal energy.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: On some summer days, the attic heats up like an oven.
The words attic and oven are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."	"The answer is **(1) simile**. 

Here's why:

* **Simile:** A simile uses the words ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two different things. 
* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly states that one thing is another thing, without using ""like"" or ""as"".

 Hint: Dustin is deciding whether to eat grapes or oatmeal cookies for an afternoon snack. He would like to eat something tasty, but he is also trying to be healthier.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Dustin wants or needs:
Dustin will give up the chance to eat the oatmeal cookies. Dustin thinks oatmeal cookies would have tasted better than grapes will."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **The concept of cost:** In economics, a cost is something you give up when you choose one option over another.  It's about the **opportunity lost**.
* **Dustin's decision:**  Dustin is choosing between grapes and cookies. If he chooses the grapes, the cost is that he won't get to eat the cookies.  He values the cookies (thinks they taste better), making this a real cost for him.

**Choice (1)** focuses on the positive outcome of eating grapes (healthier). While this is a benefit, it doesn't represent the cost of Dustin's decision.

 Hint: Great blue herons live near wetlands and lakes. They eat mostly fish.
The 's neck helps it grab fish while keeping the rest of its body still. If the heron had to move its body, it might scare the fish away.
Figure: great blue heron.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the great blue heron.
The great blue heron has a long neck. Its neck is adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still. This allows the great blue heron to grab the prey without scaring it away.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The saddle-billed stork has a long neck. Its neck is adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still.
The blue-footed booby has a short neck. Its neck is not adapted for hunting prey while keeping the rest of its body still."	"The answer is **(1) saddle-billed stork**. 

Here's why:

* **Great Blue Heron:** The image clearly shows the heron's long, flexible neck, which it uses to spear fish without moving its body.
* **Saddle-billed Stork:**  These birds also have long necks and similar hunting techniques to herons. They stalk their prey and then strike with their long necks to snatch it.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for brown eyes (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two guinea pigs.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with red eyes or brown eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the e allele, which is for red eyes, is recessive to the E allele, which is for brown eyes.
Red eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A guinea pig with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.
Brown eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A guinea pig with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with brown eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with red eyes to offspring with brown eyes is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with red eyes. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with brown eyes."	"The answer is **(2) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Trait:**  Red eyes are a recessive trait, meaning an offspring needs two copies of the recessive allele (e) to express it.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes are ""ee,"" which represents red eyes.
* **No Dominant Alleles:** There are no genotypes in the Punnett square with at least one ""E"" allele (for brown eyes), meaning no offspring will have brown eyes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black fur (1) brown fur
 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
Bandit is a Labrador retriever from this group. Bandit has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene.
 Solution: Bandit's genotype for the fur color gene is FF. Bandit's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for black fur. So, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait must be black fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Bandit's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Bandit's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait must be black fur."	"The answer is **(0) black fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Bandit's genotype is FF, meaning he has two copies of the dominant allele (F) for black fur.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for black fur (F) is dominant over the allele for brown fur (f).
* **Phenotype:**  Since Bandit has at least one dominant allele (F), his phenotype (physical appearance) will express the dominant trait, which is black fur.

* **Ice melting** is also a physical change. It's a change of state (solid to liquid), but the chemical composition (water, H₂O) doesn't change. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes.**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. Neither bending a paper clip nor melting ice create new substances.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating.**  While heating can cause ice to melt, bending a paper clip is usually caused by applying force.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling.**  Neither change is typically caused by cooling.  Cooling would freeze water, the opposite of melting.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) paradox (1) hyperbole
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses hyperbole, an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
Endless list is an exaggeration, since it is unlikely that their list of chores actually goes on forever."	"The correct answer is **(1) hyperbole**. 

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole** is a figure of speech that uses exaggeration for emphasis or effect. In this case, the phrase ""endless list"" is a clear exaggeration, implying that the list of chores is very long but not actually infinite. 

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **Paradox** is a statement that seems contradictory or self-contradictory, yet may contain a truth.  The text doesn't present any contradictory statements.

Hydrogen sulfide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas that is produced by some types of bacteria found in swamps and marshes. The chemical formula for hydrogen sulfide is H2S.
 Solution: You can tell whether hydrogen sulfide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for hydrogen sulfide is H2 S. This formula contains two symbols: H for hydrogen and S for sulfur. So, the formula tells you that hydrogen sulfide is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, hydrogen sulfide is a compound."	"Hydrogen sulfide is **(1) a compound**.

The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Aiden shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"You are absolutely correct! 

**Choice (1) is the correct answer.**

The text ""Aiden shivered **terribly** as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent."" uses the word ""terribly"" in its traditional sense, meaning **in a terrible manner**. Aiden is shivering intensely, likely due to the cold or fear.

 Hint: Maria is deciding whether to go as a ghost or a superhero to a costume party. She would rather go as a ghost. But she already has a superhero costume.
 Solution: This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Maria wants or needs:
Maria will spend some time and money to get the costume."	"The solution is correct. Here's why:

* **Opportunity Cost:** The main concept here is opportunity cost.  Maria is giving up the opportunity to wear her existing superhero costume, which she could have used for free, to get a new ghost costume. 
* **Time and Money:**  Acquiring the ghost costume requires both time (shopping, possibly crafting) and money (buying materials or a pre-made costume). These are the ""costs"" associated with her decision.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Cracking open a peanut is a physical change. The peanut shell breaks and the peanut falls out. Both are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Physical Changes:** These changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical composition. 
    * Bending a paper clip changes its shape but it remains metal.
    * Cracking a peanut changes its form (breaking the shell), but the peanut itself remains the same chemically.

* **Chemical Changes:** These changes result in the formation of new substances with different properties.  

Neither bending a paper clip nor cracking a peanut creates a new substance, so they are not chemical changes.

Although she left her house early, Nora barely made it to the train station in time."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Complex Sentence:**  A complex sentence has one independent clause (can stand alone) and at least one dependent clause (cannot stand alone).

* **Choice (0):**
    * **Independent Clause:** Nora barely made it to the train station in time.

 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the length of a soccer field is 365 feet.
365 inches is too short. 365 yards and 365 miles are too long."	"The solution is correct! Here's why:

* **365 inches:** This is about 30 feet, which is way too short for a soccer field.
* **365 yards:** This is over 1000 feet, which is much too long for a standard soccer field.
* **365 miles:**  This is incredibly long, obviously not the size of a soccer field.
* **365 feet:**  This is the most reasonable estimate.  A standard soccer field is about 100-120 yards long, which is about 300-360 feet.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the persimmon tree.There are four paths matter can take from the persimmon tree to the parasol fungus: persimmon tree->black bear->parasol fungus. persimmon tree->pine vole->parasol fungus. persimmon tree->swallowtail caterpillar->black bear->parasol fungus. persimmon tree->swallowtail caterpillar->pine vole->parasol fungus. There are three paths matter can take from the persimmon tree to the gray fox: persimmon tree->pine vole->gray fox. persimmon tree->swallowtail caterpillar->gray fox. persimmon tree->swallowtail caterpillar->pine vole->gray fox. silver maple. The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the persimmon tree to the silver maple.. beaver. The only arrow pointing to the beaver starts from the silver maple. The silver maple does not have an arrow pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the persimmon tree to the beaver.. There are two paths matter can take from the persimmon tree to the pine vole: persimmon tree->pine vole. persimmon tree->swallowtail caterpillar->pine vole."	"The answer is **(0) parasol fungus**. 

Here's why:

* **Parasol fungus:** The food web shows multiple paths where matter from the persimmon tree can reach the parasol fungus. For example:
    * Persimmon tree -> Black bear -> Parasol fungus
    * Persimmon tree -> Pine vole -> Parasol fungus
    * Persimmon tree -> Swallowtail caterpillar -> Black bear -> Parasol fungus
    * Persimmon tree -> Swallowtail caterpillar -> Pine vole -> Parasol fungus

* **Silver maple:** There is no arrow leading to the silver maple from the persimmon tree, meaning matter from the persimmon tree cannot reach the silver maple in this food web.

* **Beaver:** The only arrow leading to the beaver starts from the silver maple. Since the silver maple doesn't receive matter from the persimmon tree, the beaver cannot either.

* **Traditional ""Factoid""**:  The word ""factoid"" was originally coined to refer to a piece of information that is presented as a fact, but is actually false or misleading. It often carries a connotation of being fabricated or sensationalized.

* **Text 2's Example**:  The reporter's ""factoid"" about the founder turned out to be based on a legend, implying it was not a true fact.  The fact that it was ""amusing"" reinforces the sense of something potentially exaggerated.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Pebbles is a guppy from this group. Pebbles has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Pebbles's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Pebbles's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Pebbles's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Pebbles's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."	"The answer is **(1) an unspotted tail**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Pebbles's genotype is **ii**, meaning she has two copies of the recessive allele (i) for the tail spots trait.
* **Dominant vs. Recessive:** The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant, while the allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive.
* **Recessive Expression:** Since Pebbles has only the recessive allele (i), her phenotype will reflect the recessive trait, which is an unspotted tail.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) orange fur (1) white fur
 Hint: In a group of Bengal tigers, some individuals have orange fur and others have white fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for white fur (f) is recessive to the allele for orange fur (F).
Athena is a Bengal tiger from this group. Athena has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene.
 Solution: Athena's genotype for the fur color gene is FF. Athena's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for orange fur. So, Athena's phenotype for the fur color trait must be orange fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Athena's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white fur (f) is recessive to the allele for orange fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Athena's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Athena's phenotype for the fur color trait must be orange fur."	"The correct answer is **(0) orange fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Athena's genotype is FF, meaning she has two dominant alleles for fur color.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for orange fur (F) is dominant over the allele for white fur (f).
* **Phenotype:**  Since Athena has at least one dominant allele (F), her phenotype will express the dominant trait, which is orange fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ice cube (1) bacteria (2) helicopter (3) hockey puck
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: An ice cube is not a living thing.
An ice cube can change. It will melt in warm weather! But it does not have all the traits of a living thing. It does not need food.
A helicopter is not a living thing.
A helicopter does not have all the traits of a living thing. It needs energy to fly, but it does not eat food. Helicopters get energy from gasoline or other fuel. They do not grow.
A hockey puck is not a living thing.
Hockey pucks do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow or respond to their environment. They do not need food or water.
Bacteria are living things.
Bacteria grow and respond to their environment. They need food and water.
Bacteria are made up of just one cell. Bacteria live nearly everywhere on Earth. They can live in the ocean, deep underground, and even inside other organisms!"	"The answer is **(1) bacteria**. 

Here's why:

* **Bacteria** are single-celled organisms that exhibit all the characteristics of life: they grow, reproduce, respond to stimuli, and require energy (food).
* **Ice cubes, helicopters, and hockey pucks** are inanimate objects. They lack the fundamental properties of life, such as growth, reproduction, and the ability to respond to their environment.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem. The ecosystem is in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web is a model that shows how the matter eaten by living things moves through an ecosystem. The arrows show how matter moves through the food web.
 Solution: Consumers eat other living things. So, there are arrows in a food web that point from other living things to consumers.
The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is a producer, not a consumer.
The kelp bass has arrows pointing to it from the kelp, the zooplankton, and the plainfin midshipman. So, the kelp bass is a consumer."	The answer is (1).	natural science

Journalists arrived just in time to witness the bedlam in the courtroom.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) history (1) a movie
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion bedlam is history.
Founded in 1247, Bedlam Hospital, England's first asylum for the mentally ill, was infamous for its seeming chaos.
The allusion bedlam means pandemonium."	"The answer is **(0) history**. 

Here's why:

* **Bedlam** is an allusion to **Bethlehem Royal Hospital** (also known as Bedlam), a mental asylum in London founded in the 13th century. 
* The hospital was notorious for its chaotic and often inhumane conditions. 
* Over time, ""bedlam"" became a synonym for **wild uproar or confusion**, which is the meaning used in the sentence. 

The word ""bedlam"" doesn't originate from a movie, but from a historical institution.

 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a kitchen sink is 24 liters.
24 milliliters is too little."	"You are absolutely correct! 

Here's why:

* **Milliliters (ml)** are very small units of volume. They are typically used to measure liquids like medicine or a small amount of water.
* **Liters (L)** are a much larger unit of volume. A liter is about the same size as a quart.

 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele H is for not having horns, and the allele h is for having horns.
Bluebell, a cow from this group, does not have horns. Bluebell has one allele for not having horns and one allele for having horns.
 Solution: An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Bluebell's observable version of the horns trait is not having horns. So, Bluebell's phenotype for the horns trait is not having horns."	"The correct answer is **(0) not having horns**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical expression of a trait.
* **Genotype** refers to the genetic makeup of an individual (the alleles they possess).
* Bluebell **doesn't have horns**, which is her observable trait, making it her phenotype. 
* The fact that Bluebell has the genotype Hh (one allele for horns and one for no horns) is important for understanding how she inherited the trait, but the question asks specifically about her phenotype.

 Choices: (0) Lester was very tired and sore. (1) Lester became paralyzed.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses hyperbole, an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
The hyperbole could no longer move a single muscle suggests that Lester was very tired and sore. His muscles were not literally incapable of moving."	"The correct answer is **(0) Lester was very tired and sore.** 

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole:**  Hyperbole is a literary device that uses exaggeration for emphasis or humor. The statement ""could no longer move a single muscle"" is a clear exaggeration.
* **Context:** The context is that Lester just finished a marathon. Marathons are incredibly demanding physically, and it's common for runners to feel extreme fatigue and muscle soreness afterwards.
* **Literal vs. Figurative:** The statement is meant to be understood figuratively, not literally.  Lester is not actually paralyzed. 

The hyperbole effectively conveys the intense exhaustion Lester is experiencing after the marathon.

 Hint: Scientists in a laboratory were working with insulin, a protein often used to treat diabetes. They left two identical vials of insulin in different places. This table shows how the temperature of each vial changed over 15minutes.
 Solution: The temperature of each vial increased, which means that the thermal energy of each vial increased. So, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each vial."	"The answer is **(1) the surroundings . . . each vial**.

The question asks about the direction of thermal energy transfer during the experiment. We know that thermal energy flows from hotter objects to colder objects. Since the temperature of each vial increased, indicating that the thermal energy of each vial increased, the energy must have flowed from the surroundings (which were at a higher temperature) to each vial.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence states a fact.
Edgar Allan Poe sold his short story ""The Fall of the House of Usher"" to Burton's Gentleman's Magazine for ten dollars in 1839.
It can be proved by reading a biography of Edgar Allan Poe.
The first sentence states an opinion.
""The Black Cat"" and ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" are Edgar Allan Poe's scariest short stories.
Scariest shows what a person believes, thinks, or feels. Another person might have a different opinion about which of Poe's short stories are the scariest."	"This is a great explanation! You've correctly identified the fact-based statement and explained why the other statement is an opinion. 

Here's a breakdown of why your reasoning is sound:

* **Fact:** A fact is something that can be proven true through evidence.  The second sentence states a historical event that can be verified through research on Edgar Allan Poe's life and works.
* **Opinion:** An opinion is a personal belief or judgment that is not necessarily based on verifiable evidence. The first sentence expresses a personal preference about which of Poe's stories are ""scariest,"" which is subjective and depends on the reader's interpretation.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The second sentence is the simple sentence. It has one subject and predicate.
Last year the state received more than thirty inches of snow."	"You are absolutely right! The correct answer is **(0) Last year the state received more than thirty inches of snow.**

Here's why:

* **Simple Sentence Definition:** A simple sentence has one independent clause. An independent clause contains a subject (who or what is doing the action) and a predicate (what the subject is doing).

Let's analyze each sentence:

* **(0) Last year the state received more than thirty inches of snow.**
    * **Subject:**  The state
    * **Predicate:** received more than thirty inches of snow
    * **This sentence has one independent clause, making it a simple sentence.**

* **(1) Mitch came in first in the race, and Colton came in second.**
    * **This sentence has two independent clauses joined by the conjunction ""and"".**  Therefore, it is a compound sentence.

The words cheeks and apples are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."	"The correct answer is **(0) simile**. 

Here's why:

* **Simile:** A simile uses the words ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two things. In this sentence, the girl's cheeks are being compared to red apples using the word ""like"". 
* **Metaphor:** A metaphor directly states that one thing *is* another thing, without using ""like"" or ""as"".

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) microscope (1) vinegar (2) stop sign (3) air inside a basketball
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The air inside a basketball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air fills all the space inside the basketball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.
A microscope is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A microscope keeps its shape when you move its parts.
A stop sign is a solid. A driver might accidentally hit a stop sign and bend it. But the stop sign would still have a size and shape of its own.
Vinegar is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour vinegar into a different container, the vinegar will take the shape of that container. But the vinegar will still take up the same amount of space."	"The correct answer is **(3) air inside a basketball**. 

Here's why:

* **Gases** are substances that fill the entire space they occupy. The air inside the basketball is a good example because it expands to fill the entire ball.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) microscope:** A microscope is a solid object. Solids have a fixed shape and volume.
* **(1) vinegar:** Vinegar is a liquid. Liquids take the shape of their container but have a fixed volume.
* **(2) stop sign:** A stop sign is also a solid object.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is (2) sample A. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy (KE) is the energy of motion. It depends on both mass and speed: KE = 1/2 * mass * speed^2.
* **Equal Speeds, Different Masses:** Both samples have the same average particle speed. However, the particles in sample A are more massive than those in sample B.
* **Higher Kinetic Energy for Sample A:**  Since sample A's particles have higher mass and the same speed as sample B's particles, they have a higher average kinetic energy.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:**  Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles. Therefore, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy (sample A) has a higher temperature.

 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease (A) and one allele for having sickle-cell disease (a). So, Deion's genotype for the sickle-cell disease gene is Aa."	"The correct answer is **(1) Aa**. 

Here's why:

* **The question asks for Deion's genotype.** Genotype refers to the specific combination of alleles an individual has for a particular gene.
* **We know Deion does not have sickle-cell disease.**  This means he cannot have two copies of the 'a' allele (aa).
* **We also know Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease (A) and one allele for having sickle-cell disease (a).** This is the combination that leads to the genotype Aa.

Therefore, the only genotype that fits the information given is Aa.

 Solution: The second greeting is correct:
Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Fred is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"You are absolutely correct! The correct greeting for a letter is **(1) Dear Fred,** 

Here's why:

* **Capitalization:**  The first word of the greeting (""Dear"") is always capitalized.
* **Proper Noun:**  ""Fred"" is a proper noun (a specific person's name), so it is also capitalized.
* **Punctuation:** The greeting always ends with a comma.

 Hint: Calcarenite has the following properties:
yellow-brown
not made by organisms
not a pure substance
found in nature
solid
no fixed crystal structure
 Solution: The properties of calcarenite match the properties of a rock. So, calcarenite is a rock."	"The answer is **(0) rock**. 

Here's why:

* **Minerals** are naturally occurring, solid substances with a defined chemical composition and crystal structure. 
* **Rocks** are made up of one or more minerals. 

Calcarenite is a sedimentary rock composed primarily of calcium carbonate (calcite) fragments. It does not have a fixed chemical composition or a definite crystal structure, making it a rock and not a mineral.

2997	2997	"Question: Which is harder?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) glass flask (1) styrofoam packing peanuts
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the glass flask is harder. If you gently press on glass, it will not change shape."	"This is a great example of how to teach a simple concept like hardness through visual reasoning. Here's a breakdown of why this approach works well:

**Strengths:**

* **Focus on Observable Properties:** The prompt emphasizes the key characteristic of hardness: resistance to deformation. This is something a child can understand through direct experience.
* **Visual Aid:** The instruction to ""look at the picture and imagine pressing""  allows the child to visualize the interaction and apply their understanding of hardness.
* **Clear and Concise Language:** The explanation is simple and avoids complex terminology. 

**Improvements (Optional):**

* **Concrete Examples:**  It might be helpful to include actual examples of pressing on glass and styrofoam (if possible) to further reinforce the concept.
* **Direct Comparison:**  Stating that ""glass is harder than styrofoam because..."" could help the child make the explicit connection.
* **Follow-Up Questions:**  You could ask follow-up questions to assess understanding, such as: ""What would happen if you pressed hard on the styrofoam?"" ""Can you think of other things that are hard?"" 

**Overall:** This is a good approach to introducing the concept of hardness to a child. The combination of visual aid and concrete examples makes it easy to understand and remember.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has dry, thin soil. It also has only a few types of organisms. (1) It has dry, thin soil. It also has many different types of organisms.
 Hint: Figure: Great Victoria Desert.
The Great Victoria Desert is a desert ecosystem in southern Australia.
 Solution: A desert is a type of ecosystem. Deserts have the following features: a small amount of rain, dry, thin soil, and many different types of organisms. So, the Great Victoria Desert has dry, thin soil. It also has many different types of organisms."	"The answer is **(1) It has dry, thin soil. It also has many different types of organisms.**

Here's why:

* **Deserts are diverse:** While deserts are known for their harsh conditions, they are home to a surprisingly wide variety of organisms, including plants, animals, insects, and microorganisms. They have adapted to survive in arid environments.
* **Thin soil:** Deserts typically have thin, dry soil due to the low rainfall and high evaporation rates. 

The statement that the Great Victoria Desert only has a few types of organisms is incorrect. Deserts have evolved unique adaptations to survive in these challenging conditions, leading to a diversity of life forms.

I bet nobody there likes a wet dog either.
—Billy Collins, ""To a Stranger Born in Some Distant Country Hundreds of Years From Now""
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) apostrophe (1) antithesis
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses apostrophe, a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity.
O inconceivable being! is a direct address to an imaginary person."	"You are absolutely correct! The figure of speech used in the text is **(0) apostrophe**. 

Here's why:

* **Apostrophe** is a figure of speech where a speaker directly addresses someone or something that is absent, dead, or inanimate. In this poem, the speaker is addressing a hypothetical person ""born in some distant country hundreds of years from now"".

Let's eliminate the other option:

* **Antithesis** involves the juxtaposition of contrasting ideas or phrases. While there are elements of contrast in the poem, it's not the primary figure of speech at play.

The direct address to this imagined person is the defining characteristic of the passage, making apostrophe the most accurate answer.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1**. 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases rapidly as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Comparing Pairs:**  Pair 1 has a larger separation between the magnets (4.85 cm) compared to Pair 2 (3.05 cm). 
* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

 Hint: This organism is a maroon clownfish. Its scientific name is Premnas biaculeatus.
 Solution: A maroon clownfish's scientific name is Premnas biaculeatus.
Premnas biaculeatus has the same scientific name as a maroon clownfish. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Diodon hystrix does not have the same scientific name as a maroon clownfish. So, Premnas biaculeatus and Diodon hystrix are not in the same species.
Halichoeres hortulanus does not have the same scientific name as a maroon clownfish. So, Premnas biaculeatus and Halichoeres hortulanus are not in the same species."	"The answer is **(2) Premnas biaculeatus**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:**  Scientific names are like a unique address for each species. The maroon clownfish is scientifically known as *Premnas biaculeatus*.

3008	3008	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have myotonia congenita, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. The question tells you that the m allele, which is for not having myotonia congenita, is recessive to the M allele, which is for having myotonia congenita.
Having myotonia congenita is the dominant allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. A goat with the dominant version of the myotonia congenita trait must have at least one dominant allele for the myotonia congenita gene. So, offspring that have myotonia congenita must have the genotype MM or Mm.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype MM or Mm.
Not having myotonia congenita is the recessive allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. A goat with the recessive version of the myotonia congenita trait must have only recessive alleles for the myotonia congenita gene. So, offspring that do not have myotonia congenita must have the genotype mm.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype mm.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that have myotonia congenita. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that do not have myotonia congenita."	"The answer is **(4) 4:0**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Trait:** Myotonia congenita is a dominant trait, meaning that an offspring will have the condition if they inherit at least one ""M"" allele.
* **Punnett Square:**  The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes (Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm) will result in the dominant phenotype (myotonia congenita). There is no possibility of an offspring with the recessive genotype (mm), which would be needed to express the absence of myotonia congenita. 

Therefore, the expected ratio is 4:0, meaning all offspring will have myotonia congenita.

 Solution: The second text uses nauseous in its traditional sense: causing disgust or nausea.
Shannon couldn't tolerate the nauseous odor emanating from the landfill, so she rolled up her car windows as she drove past.
The first text uses nauseous in its nontraditional sense: feeling disgusted or nauseated.
The odor emanating from the landfill made Shannon so nauseous that she had to roll up the car windows as she drove past.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word nauseous because it is considered more standard."	"You are absolutely correct!  Here's a breakdown of why the second text uses ""nauseous"" correctly:

* **Traditional Use:** ""Nauseous"" means **causing nausea or disgust**.  It describes something that makes someone feel sick.  
* **Non-Traditional Use:** ""Nauseous"" is often incorrectly used to mean **feeling nauseated or disgusted**.  This is a common error, but the word ""nauseated"" is the correct term for this feeling.

**In the texts:**

* **Text (1):**  ""The odor emanating from the landfill made Shannon so nauseous that she had to roll up the car windows as she drove past.""  This text incorrectly uses ""nauseous"" to describe Shannon's *feeling*. It should be ""The odor emanating from the landfill made Shannon so **nauseated** that she had to roll up the car windows as she drove past.""
* **Text (2):**  ""Shannon couldn't tolerate the nauseous odor emanating from the landfill, so she rolled up her car windows as she drove past."" This text correctly uses ""nauseous"" to describe the *odor* itself, which is causing nausea.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.
 Solution: Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a greater distance between the magnets (46.1 mm) compared to Pair 2 (23.8 mm).
* **Conclusion:** Because the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart, the magnetic force between them will be weaker.

Mr. Duran is enjoying his golden years in a luxurious beachside community just down the street from his grandchildren.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Mr. Duran lives near his family. (1) Mr. Duran is old.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a euphemism, a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The euphemism golden years indicates that Mr. Duran is old. Golden years is a nicer way of referring to old age."	"The correct answer is **(1) Mr. Duran is old**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  ""Golden years"" is a euphemism for old age. It's a gentler way of referring to the later stages of life.
* **Suggestion:**  The use of this euphemism suggests that Mr. Duran is elderly, even though the text doesn't explicitly state his age. 

While it's true that Mr. Duran lives near his family (choice 0), the euphemism itself doesn't primarily suggest that. It's the indirect way of referring to his age that's the key takeaway.

 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(0) sample B**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's directly related to both mass and velocity. 
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **The scenario:** Both samples have particles moving at the same average speed, but the particles in sample B are significantly heavier.  
* **Conclusion:** Since the particles in sample B have greater mass, they have greater kinetic energy even though their speeds are the same. This means sample B has a higher temperature.

an antacid tablet reacting with water
acid rain weathering a marble statue
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
An antacid tablet reacting with water is a chemical change. When the tablet touches water, the type of matter in the tablet changes and carbon dioxide gas is released. This gas makes the water fizz.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Antacid tablet reacting with water:** The tablet's chemical composition changes as it reacts with water. This is evidenced by the fizzing (release of carbon dioxide gas), indicating a new substance is being formed. 
* **Acid rain weathering a marble statue:** The acid in the rain reacts with the calcium carbonate in the marble, breaking it down into different substances. This is a clear chemical transformation.

**Important to note:** 
* **Physical changes** alter the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition (like melting ice or cutting paper). 
* **Chemical changes** result in the formation of new substances with different chemical properties (like burning wood or rusting iron).

 Choices: (0) It eats a secondary consumer. (1) It makes its own food. (2) It eats a primary consumer.
 Hint: This diagram shows a food chain from a grassland ecosystem in Wyoming.
 Solution: In this food chain, the red fox is a tertiary consumer because it eats a secondary consumer. The secondary consumer in this food chain is the deer mouse."	"The answer is **(0) It eats a secondary consumer.**

Here's why:

* **Tertiary consumers** are animals that eat secondary consumers.  
* In the food chain, the red fox eats the deer mouse.
* The deer mouse is a secondary consumer because it eats the katydid, which is a primary consumer. 

Let's break down the food chain:

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Edna. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Edna.
 Hint: Edna is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Edna with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Edna with a force of 1,200N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Edna, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Edna down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Edna up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Edna."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Edna.**

Here's why:

* **Unbalanced Forces:**  Even though the forces are acting in opposite directions (gravity down, seat up), they have different magnitudes (600 N vs. 1200 N). This means they don't cancel each other out completely. 
* **Net Force:** Since the upward force from the seat is stronger, there's a net force pushing Edna upwards. This is why she doesn't fall out of the cart at the bottom of the loop!

 Hint: This organism is a great egret. Its scientific name is Ardea alba.
 Solution: A great egret's scientific name is Ardea alba.
Lynx lynx does not have the same scientific name as a great egret. So, Ardea alba and Lynx lynx are not in the same species.
Tyto alba does have the same species within its genus as a great egret, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species.
Ardea alba has the same scientific name as a great egret. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"The answer is **(0) Ardea alba**. 

Here's why:

* **Scientific Names:**  Scientific names use a two-part system (binomial nomenclature) with the genus followed by the species.  
    * **Great egret:** *Ardea alba*
    * **Ardea alba:** *Ardea alba* 
* **Species:** Organisms are classified into the same species if they have the same scientific name. Since both the great egret and *Ardea alba* share the same name, they are in the same species.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 0:4 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight ears or curled ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for curled ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for straight ears.
Straight ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. An American curl cat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with straight ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Curled ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. An American curl cat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with curled ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with straight ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with curled ears."	"The answer is **(1) 0:4**. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant.
* **Recessive Allele:** The allele for straight ears (e) is recessive.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all offspring will inherit at least one 'E' allele, resulting in curled ears.  There are no combinations that would lead to straight ears (ee).

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Tessa's friends are constantly getting detention, so Tessa must have started the food fight. However, Tessa's friends don't necessarily determine her actions. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* The argument attempts to link Tessa's actions to the behavior of her friends. It assumes that because her friends get detention frequently, she must have been responsible for the food fight. 
* This is a fallacy because it unfairly associates Tessa with the actions of her friends without any direct evidence linking her to the food fight. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) false dichotomy:** This fallacy presents two options as the only possibilities when more options exist. The text doesn't offer a limited choice.

 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two leopards.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a black coat or a spotted coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for a spotted coat, is dominant over the a allele, which is for a black coat.
A black coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A leopard with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
A spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A leopard with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a black coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 1:3. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 1 offspring with a black coat for every 3 offspring with a spotted coat."	"The correct answer is **(1) 1:3**. 

The Punnett square shows that there is 1 box with the genotype aa (black coat) and 3 boxes with the genotype AA or Aa (spotted coat). This means the expected ratio of black coat to spotted coat offspring is 1:3.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old. (1) Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The first text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
The second text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). The bridge is old, but it is not actually a million years old.
Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."	"The correct answer is **(1) Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional ""literally""**:  Means ""actually"" or ""in a literal sense"". It implies something is true without exaggeration.
* **Non-traditional ""literally""**: Often used for emphasis, even when something is not literally true. It can be considered an informal or even incorrect usage. 

In choice (1), ""literally hundreds of years old"" is factually accurate. The Rialto Bridge is indeed hundreds of years old. 

In choice (0), ""literally a million years old"" is a hyperbole. It's an exaggeration used for emphasis, not a literal statement.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	The answer is (2).	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1,145 milliliters (1) 1,145 liters
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool is 1,145 liters.
1,145 milliliters is too little."	"You're absolutely right! The better estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool is **(1) 1,145 liters**. 

Here's why:

* **Milliliters (ml)** are a very small unit of measurement, typically used for liquids like water in small containers.
* **Liters (L)** are a larger unit, often used for measuring larger quantities of liquids.  

A kiddie pool would hold a significant amount of water, making 1,145 liters a much more reasonable estimate than 1,145 milliliters.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The helicopter has a constant velocity. (1) The helicopter is accelerating.
 Hint: A rescue helicopter is moving directly upward at a constant speed.
 Solution: The helicopter is moving in a straight line at a constant speed. So, the helicopter has a constant velocity."	"The correct answer is **(0) The helicopter has a constant velocity.**

Here's why:

* **Velocity** is a combination of speed and direction. 
* The helicopter is moving **upward** (direction) at a **constant speed** (speed).  
* Since both speed and direction are unchanging, the helicopter's velocity is constant.

**Acceleration** occurs when there is a change in velocity. Since the helicopter's velocity is constant, it's not accelerating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder soap bubble (1) the hotter soap bubble
 Hint: Two soap bubbles are identical except for their temperatures.
 Solution: The two soap bubbles are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder soap bubble has less thermal energy."	"The answer is **(0) the colder soap bubble**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.
* **Colder objects** have lower average kinetic energy, meaning their particles are moving slower. 

Since the two soap bubbles are identical except for their temperatures, the colder bubble has lower average kinetic energy and therefore less thermal energy.

 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the sea cucumber.
The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.There is one path matter can take from the orca to the sea cucumber: orca->sea cucumber. There is one path matter can take from the sea otter to the sea cucumber: sea otter->orca->sea cucumber. There is one path matter can take from the zooplankton to the sea cucumber: zooplankton->plainfin midshipman->sea cucumber."	"The answer is (0) zooplankton. 

Here's why:

* **Follow the arrows:** The arrows in the food web show the direction of energy and matter flow. 
* **Zooplankton to Sea Cucumber:**  An arrow points from zooplankton to plainfin midshipman, and another arrow points from plainfin midshipman to the sea cucumber. This means matter from zooplankton can move to the sea cucumber.

Isabella submitted her suggestions to Carson; now the ball is in his court.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Carson needs to act next. (1) Carson feels like playing or relaxing, not working.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses an idiom, an expression that cannot be understood literally.
The idiom the ball is in his court suggests that Carson needs to act next. In tennis, when the ball is in a player's court, it is that person's turn."	"The correct answer is **(0) Carson needs to act next.** 

Here's why:

* **The idiom ""the ball is in his court""** is a metaphor derived from tennis. When the ball is in a player's court, it's their turn to hit the ball. 
* **In the context of the sentence**, it means that Isabella has done her part by submitting her suggestions. Now, it's Carson's turn to decide what to do with them. 

Option (1) is incorrect because the idiom does not suggest that Carson feels like playing or relaxing. It implies responsibility and the need to take action.

3091	3091	"Question: Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Grayson remarked that the new book on anti-gravity was impossible to put down.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pun (1) alliteration
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses a pun, a word or phrase that humorously suggests more than one meaning.
Impossible to put down means that the book is so good that it is hard to stop reading. The phrase impossible to put down is also a joke about anti-gravity: if gravity pulls things down, perhaps anti-gravity does the opposite and makes them impossible to put down."	"The correct answer is **(0) pun**. 

You are absolutely right! The sentence uses a pun because the phrase ""impossible to put down"" has two meanings:

1. **Literal:**  The book is so engaging that it's hard to stop reading.
2. **Figurative:**  The book is about anti-gravity, which is a concept that defies gravity and keeps things from being put down. 

This double meaning creates a humorous effect, making it a pun.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has cool summers and long, cold winters. (1) It has a rainy season and a dry season.
 Hint: Figure: Gran Sabana.
The Gran Sabana is a savanna grassland ecosystem in southeastern Venezuela. This savanna has many flat-topped mountains called mesas.
 Solution: A savanna grassland is a type of ecosystem. Savanna grasslands have the following features: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. So, the following statements describe the Gran Sabana ecosystem: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. It has a rainy season and a dry season. It has soil that is poor in nutrients. The following statement does not describe the Gran Sabana: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. It has cool summers and long, cold winters."	"The answer is **(1) It has a rainy season and a dry season.** 

Here's why:

* **Savannas are characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons.** This is a defining feature of savanna ecosystems, and the Gran Sabana, being a savanna, fits this description. 
* **Option (0) is incorrect.**  Savannas are known for their warm temperatures year-round.  Cool summers and long, cold winters are typical of temperate climates, not tropical savannas.

 Hint: This organism is a western crowned pigeon. Its scientific name is Goura cristata.
 Solution: A western crowned pigeon's scientific name is Goura cristata. The first word of its scientific name is Goura.
This organism and the western crowned pigeon are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Goura cristata.
Agalychnis callidryas is in the genus Agalychnis. The first word of its scientific name is Agalychnis. So, Agalychnis callidryas and Goura cristata are not in the same genus.
Hystrix cristata and Goura cristata are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Hystrix cristata and Goura cristata have the same species name within their genus, cristata. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Hystrix cristata is in the genus Hystrix, and Goura cristata is in the genus Goura."	"The answer is **(2) Goura cristata**. 

Here's why:

* The scientific name of the western crowned pigeon is *Goura cristata*. 
* The genus is the first part of the scientific name, which is *Goura*. 
* *Goura cristata* is the only option listed that shares the same genus (*Goura*) as the western crowned pigeon.

 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Solution: The best estimate for the mass of a full box of cereal is 23 ounces.
23 pounds and 23 tons are both too heavy."	"The solution is correct! Here's why:

* **23 ounces** is a reasonable weight for a box of cereal. Most cereal boxes are between 10 and 20 ounces.
* **23 pounds** is much too heavy. That's about the weight of a large dog. 
* **23 tons** is incredibly heavy. That's the weight of a small truck!

After Josh beat Scott in tennis, he asked for a rematch.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Scott asked for a rematch after Josh beat him in tennis."	"You are absolutely correct!  The sentence with the vague pronoun reference is:

**(1) After Josh beat Scott in tennis, he asked for a rematch.**

Here's why:

* **The pronoun ""he"" could refer to either Josh or Scott.**  The sentence doesn't make it clear who is asking for the rematch.

The first sentence,  **(0) Scott asked for a rematch after Josh beat him in tennis.**, is clearer because it uses the pronoun ""him"" which directly refers back to Scott.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The rotifer has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae. The green algae is a producer, so the rotifer is a primary consumer.
The water flea has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae. The green algae is a producer, so the water flea is a primary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea, the rotifer, and the shiner. None of these organisms is a produce, so the black crappie is not a primary consumer.
The water mold has an arrow pointing to it from the black crappie. The black crappie is not a producer, so the water mold is not a primary consumer."	"The answer is **(0) water flea**. 

Here's why:

* **Primary consumers** are organisms that eat producers (plants or algae that make their own food through photosynthesis).

A Laos giant forest scorpion has the traits of an arachnid. A Laos giant forest scorpion is an arachnid.
An earthworm has the following traits:
It has a soft, cylindrical body.
It has no limbs.
It is made up of segments.
An earthworm does not have all of the traits of an arachnid. An earthworm is a segmented worm."	"The correct answer is **(1) Laos giant forest scorpions**. 

Here's why:

* **Arachnid Traits:** Eight legs, exoskeleton, no antennae.
* **Laos Giant Forest Scorpion:**  Possesses all three of these traits.

Don't ever get a ride from Elizabeth. Her brother has been driving for only six months, and he's already gotten three speeding tickets.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Elizabeth must be a reckless driver, because her brother is a reckless driver. However, even though Elizabeth's brother is reckless, that doesn't necessarily mean that Elizabeth is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** occurs when someone is judged negatively based on their association with someone else, even if there's no evidence that they share the same characteristics. In this case, Elizabeth is being judged as a bad driver because of her brother's driving record, even though there's no indication she shares his tendencies.

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Hasty generalization:** This fallacy involves drawing a broad conclusion from insufficient evidence. While the text does make a claim about Elizabeth's driving based on her brother's behavior, it's not a broad claim about all people related to reckless drivers. 

Therefore, **guilt by association** is the most accurate description of the logical fallacy present in the text.

3108	3108	"Question: Assume all other forces on Emmet are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Emmet?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Emmet. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Emmet.
 Hint: Emmet is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Emmet with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Emmet with a force of 400N.
 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Emmet, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Emmet down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Emmet up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Emmet."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Emmet.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced forces:**  When forces are balanced, they are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This means they cancel each other out.
* **Net force:**  The net force is the overall force acting on an object. When forces are balanced, the net force is zero.
* **Emmet's situation:** Gravity pulls Emmet down with 400N, and the diving board pushes him up with 400N. These forces are equal and opposite, so they are balanced.

Since the forces are balanced, there's no net force on Emmet. This means he's not accelerating and will remain stationary.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Glass melting is caused by heating. But sewing an apron is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.**

Here's why:

* **Sewing an apron:**  This is a physical change because you are simply altering the shape and form of the fabric. The fabric itself remains the same material.
* **Melting glass:** This is also a physical change. You're changing the state of the glass from solid to liquid, but the chemical composition of the glass remains the same. 

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Melting glass requires heating, not cooling.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties. This doesn't happen in either case.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:** Only the melting of glass is caused by heating. Sewing doesn't involve heat.

 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time. This behavior is called fanning.
By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch.
Figure: a fifteen-spined stickleback.
 Solution: Look for the part of the passage that describes the effect of fanning eggs. Use this information to determine why this behavior can increase the reproductive success of the male fifteen-spined stickleback.
Choice ""Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females.

Choice ""By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch."" is incorrect.
Choice ""Choice ""Fanning eggs increases the chances that the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in."" is incorrect."" is incorrect.
Choice ""Fanning eggs does not affect whether a male builds a nest. Instead, the male builds a nest before he fans his eggs. So, the passage does not support this claim."" is incorrect.
Choice ""Choice ""Fanning eggs increases the chances that the male's offspring will become adults."" is incorrect."" is correct.
Choice ""According to the underlined text, fanning eggs helps bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male stickleback fans his eggs, the more of his eggs hatch. This increases the chances that the male's offspring will become adults, which can increase his reproductive success."" is incorrect.
Choice ""Choice ""Fanning eggs increases the chances that the male will spend more energy while waving his fins."" is incorrect."" is incorrect.
Choice ""To increase his reproductive success, the male stickleback needs to have offspring that survive to reproduce. Spending more energy waving his fins does not directly increase the male's chances of producing offspring that survive to reproduce. So, spending more energy waving his fins is not why fanning eggs increases the male's reproductive success."" is incorrect."	"Fanning eggs increases the chances that **(1) the male's offspring will become adults**. 

The passage states that fanning brings fresh water and nutrients to the eggs, which helps more of them hatch. The more eggs that hatch, the more offspring the male will have, and the higher his reproductive success will be.

3121	3121	"Question: Based on this information, what is Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Sebastian is a guppy from this group. Sebastian has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Sebastian's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Sebastian's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Sebastian's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Sebastian's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."	"The answer is **(1) an unspotted tail**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Sebastian's genotype is **ii**, meaning he has two recessive alleles for the tail spots trait.
* **Recessive Allele:** The allele 'i' represents an unspotted tail, and it's recessive.
* **Phenotype:** Since Sebastian has two recessive alleles, his phenotype (physical appearance) will be determined by the recessive allele.  Therefore, he will have an unspotted tail.

For each object, decide if it has that property.
Sugar has a sweet taste. The honey is sweet, but the ocean water and the wet ice cube are not.
A translucent object lets light through. But you cannot see clearly through a translucent object. All three objects are translucent.
A rough object feels scratchy when you touch it. None of the objects are rough.
The property that all three objects have in common is translucent."	"The answer is **(0) translucent**. 

Here's why:

* **Translucent:**  All three objects (honey, ocean water, and wet ice cube) allow some light to pass through them, but you can't see clearly through them. This makes them translucent.
* **Sweet:**  Only honey is sweet. Ocean water and ice cubes are not.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Distance Matters:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.
* **Pair Comparison:** Pair 2 has a smaller distance between the magnets (13 mm) compared to Pair 1 (21.2 mm).
* **Force Magnitude:** Because the magnets in Pair 2 are closer, the magnetic force between them will be stronger.

Then compare the result to the volume of Neptune. The volume of Neptune is 62,530 billion km^3, which is more than 54,500 billion km^3. So, Neptune's volume is more than 50 times as great as that of Earth."	(0) true	natural science
3153	3153	"Question: Bees and other animals can be pollinators. How does a pollinator pollinate a flower?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) by dropping pollen on the anthers (1) by dropping pollen on the pistil
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.
 Solution: A pollinator picks up pollen when it brushes against a flower's anthers. Pollen then falls off the pollinator onto the pistil of that flower, or another flower.
A pollinator might drop pollen anywhere, but pollination happens only when pollen lands on the top of the pistil."	"The answer is **(1) by dropping pollen on the pistil**. 

Here's why:

* **Pollination** is the process of transferring pollen from the anther (the male part of a flower) to the pistil (the female part of a flower).
* **Pollinators** like bees and other animals pick up pollen on their bodies when they visit flowers.
* They then transfer this pollen to the pistil of the same flower or another flower.

The other answer choice is incorrect:

* **(0) by dropping pollen on the anthers**  - While pollen may fall on the anthers, it doesn't contribute to pollination. The pollen needs to be transferred to the pistil for fertilization to occur.

Las Vegas, Nevada, has more than 200 sunny days per year.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) climate (1) weather
 Hint: Hint: Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.
 Solution: Read the text carefully.
Las Vegas, Nevada, has more than 200 sunny days per year.
This passage tells you about the usual pattern of clouds in Las Vegas. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"The answer is **(0) climate**. 

Here's why:

* **Weather** refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions at a specific time and place. Examples include temperature, precipitation, wind, and cloud cover on a particular day.
* **Climate** refers to the long-term weather patterns in a region. It's a description of the average weather conditions over many years.

""This is the best day of my life,"" Mr. Bradley mumbled after his car broke down on the way to an important job interview.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Mr. Bradley was already running late. (1) Mr. Bradley was having a bad day.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
The best day of my life ironically suggests that Mr. Bradley was having a bad day. He was having the opposite of a good day because his car broke down when he needed to be on time."	"The correct answer is **(1) Mr. Bradley was having a bad day.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that contradicts the actual situation, often with a sarcastic or humorous intent. 
* In this case, Mr. Bradley's statement ""This is the best day of my life"" is clearly an exaggeration, as his car breaking down on the way to an important interview is a major inconvenience and likely causing him stress. 
* By saying this, he is ironically highlighting the fact that his day is going terribly. 

The choice (0) ""Mr. Bradley was already running late"" is not directly suggested by the verbal irony. While it's possible he was running late, the irony focuses more on the overall negative experience of the day.

 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
Hachiko, a Labrador retriever from this group, has brown fur. Hachiko has two alleles for brown fur.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Hachiko has two alleles for brown fur (f). So, Hachiko's genotype for the fur color gene is ff."	"The answer is **(0) ff**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  This refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a trait.
* **Alleles:**  Different versions of a gene. In this case, 'F' is for black fur and 'f' is for brown fur.
* **Hachiko's Fur:** Since Hachiko has brown fur, we know he must have two recessive 'f' alleles.
* **Recessive Alleles:**  A recessive allele only shows its trait if an organism has two copies of it. 

Therefore, Hachiko's genotype is **ff**, meaning he has two copies of the recessive allele for brown fur.

 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample B**. 

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:**  Kinetic energy is the energy of motion.  It's directly related to an object's mass and speed.  The equation is: KE = 1/2 * mv², where KE is kinetic energy, m is mass, and v is velocity (speed).
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:**  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance. 
* **The Diagrams:** The diagrams show that the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A.  Since the particles have the same mass, the higher average speed in sample B means a higher average kinetic energy.  This higher average kinetic energy translates to a higher temperature in sample B.

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have double flowers and others have single flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower form trait has two alleles. The allele F is for double flowers, and the allele f is for single flowers.
A certain rose plant from this group has single flowers. This plant has two alleles for single flowers.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The rose plant has two alleles for single flowers (f). So, the plant's genotype for the flower form gene is ff."	"The correct answer is **(0) ff**. 

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the genotype.** Genotype refers to the specific combination of alleles an organism has for a particular gene.
* **We know the plant has single flowers.** This tells us it must carry the recessive allele 'f' for flower form.
* **The passage states the plant has two alleles for single flowers.**  This means its genotype is **ff**. 

The other choice, ""single flowers,"" describes the phenotype (the physical trait) and not the genotype.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.**  Here's why:

* **Size Matters:** The strength of a magnetic force is directly related to the size of the magnets. Larger magnets produce stronger magnetic fields.
* **Pair 1 vs. Pair 2:** In Pair 1, the magnet on the right is larger than the corresponding magnet in Pair 2. This means the magnetic field produced by the larger magnet in Pair 1 will be stronger, resulting in a greater magnetic force.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3 liters (1) 3 milliliters
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Solution: The better estimate for the volume of a small measuring spoon is 3 milliliters.
3 liters is too much."	"You are absolutely correct! The answer is **(1) 3 milliliters**.

Here's why:

* **Liters (L)** are a unit for measuring large volumes, like the amount of water in a bathtub or a bottle of soda.
* **Milliliters (mL)** are a unit for measuring smaller volumes, like the amount of liquid in a teaspoon or a measuring spoon.

A small measuring spoon would typically hold a few milliliters, not several liters.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straight fur (1) wavy fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Briar is a Syrian hamster from this group. Briar has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur texture gene.
 Solution: Briar's genotype for the fur texture gene is FF. Briar's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Briar's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Briar's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur."	"The answer is **(0) straight fur**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Briar's genotype is FF, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele (F) for straight fur.
* **Dominant Allele:**  The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f). This means that if an organism has at least one F allele, it will have straight fur.
* **Phenotype:** Since Briar has two F alleles, her phenotype (physical expression) for fur texture is straight fur.

Brett has naturally black hair.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) inherited (1) acquired
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Some people dye their hair. But this does not change their natural hair color.
Children get their natural hair color from their parents. So, Brett's hair color is an inherited trait."	"The answer is **(0) inherited**. 

Here's why:

* **Inherited traits** are passed down from parents to offspring through genes. Hair color is a classic example of an inherited trait.
* **Acquired traits** are developed during a person's lifetime due to environmental factors or experiences.  

Since Brett's black hair is his natural color, it wasn't something he acquired. It was determined by the genes he inherited from his parents.

 Choices: (0) Amazon milk frog (1) snowy owl
 Hint: Musk oxen live in the Canadian Arctic and Greenland. The 's skin is adapted to help the animal survive in cold places.
Figure: musk ox.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the musk ox.
The musk ox has skin with thick fur on top and a thick layer of fat underneath it. Its skin is adapted for survival in cold places. The musk ox uses its fur and fat to keep warm in cold weather.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The snowy owl has a thick coat of feathers covering its skin. Its skin is adapted for survival in cold places.
The Amazon milk frog has thin, moist skin. Its skin is not adapted for survival in cold places."	"The answer is **(1) snowy owl**. 

The snowy owl, like the musk ox, has thick layers of insulation (feathers for the snowy owl, fur for the musk ox) to help it survive in cold environments.  The Amazon milk frog has thin, moist skin, which is not suited for cold weather.

Don't try to tell me that you only watch educational programming, Valeria! I know for a fact that your sister only watches reality television.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The text argues that Valeria must watch reality television, because her sister watches reality television. However, even though Valeria's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Valeria does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association."	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** is when someone is judged or criticized based on their association with another person or group, even if they haven't done anything wrong themselves.  In this case, the speaker is assuming Valeria watches reality TV because her sister does. 

Let's look at why the other option is incorrect:

* **Hasty generalization:** This fallacy involves making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. While the speaker might be making a generalization about Valeria's viewing habits, it's not based on very little evidence – it's based on the habits of her sister, which isn't necessarily a valid basis for judgment.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bat that moved 165kilometers in 10hours (1) a bat that moved 130kilometers in 10hours
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Look at the distance each bat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bat moved 165 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other bat moved 130 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each bat spent the same amount of time moving. The bat that moved 165 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bat must have moved at a higher speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) a bat that moved 165 kilometers in 10 hours**. 

Here's why:

* **Speed** is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 
* Both bats traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours). 
* The bat that traveled 165 kilometers covered a greater distance in the same amount of time, meaning it must have been moving faster.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more pink particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of pink particles."	"The answer is **(2) Solution A**. 

Here's why:

* **Concentration** is a measure of how much solute is dissolved in a given amount of solvent. 
* **Solution A** has 8 pink particles in 40 mL of solvent.
* **Solution B** has 7 pink particles in 40 mL of solvent.

Since Solution A has more solute particles in the same volume of solvent, it has a higher concentration.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Put the words in alphabetical order.
Since virus is between the guide words veil - vote, it would be found on that page."	"The correct answer is **(1) virus**. 

You're absolutely right! Here's why:

* **Guide words** at the top of a dictionary page tell you the first and last words on that page alphabetically.
* **""veil""** comes before **""virus""** alphabetically.
* **""virus""** comes before **""vote""** alphabetically.

Therefore, **""virus""** would be found on the dictionary page with the guide words ""veil"" and ""vote"".

3198	3198	"Question: Based on this information, what is Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) a hairless body
 Hint: In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B).
Skeeter is a deer mouse from this group. Skeeter has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene.
 Solution: Skeeter's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skeeter's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.
To check this answer, consider whether Skeeter's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Skeeter's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body."	"The correct answer is **(1) a hairless body**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Allele:** The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive. This means it only expresses the hairless trait if two copies of the 'b' allele are present.
* **Skeeter's Genotype:** Skeeter has the genotype 'bb', meaning he has two copies of the recessive 'b' allele.
* **Phenotype Expression:**  Since Skeeter has two copies of the recessive allele, his phenotype (physical appearance) will be a hairless body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.
 Solution: The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. It's calculated with the formula KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where:
    * KE is kinetic energy
    * m is mass
    * v is velocity (speed)

* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * **Sample A** has particles with higher mass (40 u) compared to **Sample B** (20 u).
    * Both samples have the same average speed (1,000 m/s).
    * Since the particles in Sample A have greater mass and the same speed as those in Sample B, they have a higher average kinetic energy.

* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. So, because Sample A has particles with higher average kinetic energy, it has a higher temperature.

3206	3206	"Question: In this food web, which organism contains matter that eventually moves to the mushroom?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) grizzly bear (1) parasitic jaeger
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the mushroom.
The only arrow pointing from the parasitic jaeger leads to the rough-legged hawk. The only arrow pointing from the rough-legged hawk leads to the earthworm. No arrows point from the earthworm to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the parasitic jaeger to the mushroom.There are two paths matter can take from the barren-ground caribou to the mushroom: barren-ground caribou->mushroom. barren-ground caribou->grizzly bear->mushroom. There is one path matter can take from the bilberry to the mushroom: bilberry->grizzly bear->mushroom. There is one path matter can take from the grizzly bear to the mushroom: grizzly bear->mushroom. There are two paths matter can take from the lichen to the mushroom: lichen->barren-ground caribou->mushroom. lichen->barren-ground caribou->grizzly bear->mushroom."	"The answer is (0) grizzly bear. 

Here's how to figure that out:

1. **Follow the arrows:** The arrows in the food web show the direction of matter flow. We need to find a path from the grizzly bear to the mushroom.

2. **Direct connection:** The food web shows a direct arrow from the grizzly bear to the mushroom. This means the matter from the grizzly bear can directly move to the mushroom.

3. **Indirect connection:** There's another path, where the grizzly bear eats the barren-ground caribou, and the caribou eats the lichen. This is an indirect path where matter from the grizzly bear can move to the mushroom. 

4. **Other options:** The parasitic jaeger is not connected to the mushroom, so its matter doesn't move to it. The other organisms either don't have a path to the mushroom or only have indirect paths, but the grizzly bear has a direct path.

Emilio spoke at the city council meeting, claiming the new recycling regulations were draconian.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Greek history (1) a fairy tale
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: The source of the allusion draconian is Greek history.
Draco, a government official in seventh-century Athens, Greece, wrote a code of laws that called for severe punishments for even minor offenses.
The allusion draconian means harsh."	"The answer is **(0) Greek history**. 

Here's why:

* **Draconian** comes from Draco, an Athenian lawmaker in the 7th century BC. His legal code was incredibly strict and harsh, often resulting in the death penalty for minor offenses. 
* The term ""draconian"" has come to mean extremely severe or harsh, especially in relation to laws or punishments.
