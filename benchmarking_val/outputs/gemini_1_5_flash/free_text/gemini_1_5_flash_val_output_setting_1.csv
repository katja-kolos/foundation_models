0	0	"Question: What does the verbal irony in this text suggest?
According to Mr. Herrera's kids, his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The snoring is loud. (1) The snoring occurs in bursts.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) The snoring is loud.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** is a literary device where what is said is the opposite of what is meant. 
* The statement ""his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer"" is clearly an exaggeration.  Jackhammers are extremely loud. 
* By saying the snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer, the speaker is ironically implying that the snoring is actually very loud. 

Let me know if you'd like to practice with more examples of verbal irony!

During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock from the mountain to create the monument.
 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) no (1) yes
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) yes**.

Here's why:

* **Missing a Verb:** The sentence lacks a main verb to explain what happened to the 800 million pounds of rock.  It only states that it was removed.
* **Incomplete Thought:** The sentence doesn't convey a complete thought. It leaves the reader wondering ""what happened to the rock?""

To make this a complete sentence, you could add a verb like ""were removed"" or ""were blasted away"".

5	5	"Question: Based on this information, what is Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene."	"The answer is **(1) having horns**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Daffodil's genotype is HH, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele (H).
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant. This means that if an individual has at least one copy of the H allele, they will not have horns. 
* **Phenotype:** Since Daffodil has two copies of the dominant allele, her phenotype (observable trait) is not having horns.

7	7	"Question: Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below."	"The answer is **(0) true**. 

Here's why:

* **Jupiter's volume:** 1.43 x 10^15 km³
* **Mars' volume:** 1.63 x 10^11 km³

To see how many times larger Jupiter is, divide Jupiter's volume by Mars' volume:

(1.43 x 10^15 km³) / (1.63 x 10^11 km³) ≈ 8770

Therefore, Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as Mars' volume.

A light spattering of raindrops fell upon the stadium, () the fans' cheeks.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) landing on (1) kissing
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) kissing**. 

Here's why:

* **Personification** is giving human qualities to inanimate objects or abstract ideas.
* The sentence is describing the raindrops as if they have the ability to ""kiss"" the fans' cheeks. 
* ""Landing on"" is a more literal description and doesn't convey the personification.

 Hint: Red-tailed hawks eat fish, mammals, and other birds. The shape of the 's beak is adapted to tear through meat.
Figure: red-tailed hawk."	"The answer is **(1) Cape vulture**. 

Here's why:

* **Red-tailed hawks** are known for their powerful beaks adapted for tearing meat, making them a good example of a bird whose beak is adapted for this task.
* **Cape vultures** are also scavengers that feed on carrion (dead animals), requiring a strong beak to tear through flesh.

11	11	"Question: Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Ariel gazed at the ancient pug that seemed to sleep all day and noted, ""You're an energetic puppy!""
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) idiom (1) verbal irony
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) verbal irony**. 

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that is the opposite of what they mean, often with the intent to be humorous or sarcastic. 

In this case, Ariel is clearly being sarcastic. The pug is described as ""ancient"" and ""sleep[ing] all day,"" which are not characteristics of an energetic puppy. 

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Idiom:** An idiom is a phrase with a figurative meaning that is different from the literal meaning of the words. There is no idiom present in this text.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ff (1) short fur
 Hint: In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele F is for short fur, and the allele f is for long fur.
Sasha, a dog from this group, has short fur. Sasha has one allele for short fur and one allele for long fur."	"The correct answer is **(1) short fur**. Here's why:

* **Phenotype:**  This refers to the physical characteristics an organism expresses. In this case, Sasha's phenotype is her fur length.
* **Genotype:** This refers to the genetic makeup of an organism. Sasha's genotype is Ff (one allele for short fur, one for long). 
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for short fur (F) is dominant. This means that even if an organism has one F and one f allele, it will still express the dominant trait (short fur).

Since Sasha has at least one dominant F allele, she will have short fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes. (1) Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath.**

Here's why:

* **Compound sentences** are made up of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and"", ""but"", ""or"", ""so"", ""for"", ""nor"", ""yet""). 
* **Independent clauses** are groups of words that can stand alone as complete sentences.

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) Those carpenters use wood to build stairways and doorframes.**  This is a simple sentence with one independent clause. 
* **(1) Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath.**  This sentence has two independent clauses (""Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud"" and ""we gave him a bath"") joined by the coordinating conjunction ""so"".

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bag holding 4 pounds of food (1) a bag holding 5 pounds of food
 Hint: A shopper is buying food at the store. He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape."	"The answer is **(1) a bag holding 5 pounds of food**. Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  The force needed to lift something is directly related to its weight. The heavier the object, the more force you need to lift it.
* **The Situation:**  The shopper lifts both bags at the same speed, meaning they're experiencing the same acceleration.  However, the bag with 5 pounds of food has more weight (and thus more mass).
* **Force Equation:**  Force = Mass x Acceleration. Since the acceleration is the same for both bags, the bag with more mass (5 pounds) will require a larger force to lift.

Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) chemical change**. Here's why:

* **Physical Change:**  A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition. Examples: melting ice, cutting paper.
* **Chemical Change:** A change where a new substance is formed with different chemical properties. Examples: burning wood, rusting iron.

When you use salt and vinegar to clean a tarnished penny, a chemical reaction occurs. The vinegar (acetic acid) reacts with the tarnish (copper oxide) to form a new compound, copper acetate, which is soluble and washes away.

In the 1970s, architect I. M. Pei took on the difficult assignment of renovating and updating the beautiful Louvre Palace in Paris without overpowering the original building. The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances. It also needed more restrooms and a bigger cafeteria. Pei designed a large central underground entrance and visitor center. He then added a glass pyramid above the entryway. Although Pei's design faced initial criticism, today the pyramid is considered a brilliant success—a landmark that complements the old palace without interfering with it."	"The text primarily uses a **(1) problem-solution** organizational structure. 

Here's why:

Don't ever get a ride from Mariana. Her brother has been driving for only six months, and he's already gotten three speeding tickets.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* The argument attempts to discredit Mariana by associating her with her brother's negative driving record. It assumes that because her brother is a bad driver, Mariana must also be unreliable or dangerous to ride with. 
* This is fallacious because there's no logical connection between the brother's driving record and Mariana's ability to give rides.

Let's eliminate the other choice:

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) short fur (1) long fur
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Chanel is a cat from this group. Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene."	"The answer is **(0) short fur**. Here's why:

* **Homozygous genotype FF:** This means Chanel has two copies of the dominant allele (F) for fur length.
* **Dominant allele:** The dominant allele (F) for short fur will always express itself if present, even if the cat also has the recessive allele (f).

Since Chanel has two dominant alleles, her fur will be **short**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 28°C (1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22°C (2) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 41°C
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(1) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22°C**. 

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within a substance.  
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles. 

The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving, and the more thermal energy they possess. Since all the bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperatures, the bowl with the lowest temperature (22°C) will have the least thermal energy.

52	52	"Question: Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is **(0) sample A**. Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.  This means higher kinetic energy equates to higher temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = (1/2) * mass * velocity^2. 
* **Comparing Samples:** Both samples have particles of the same mass (30 u), but Sample A has a higher average particle speed (1200 m/s) than Sample B (1000 m/s). Since speed is squared in the KE equation, the higher speed of Sample A results in significantly higher average kinetic energy. 

Therefore, Sample A has the higher average kinetic energy, which corresponds to a higher temperature.

57	57	"Question: Which figure of speech is used in this text?
The grave's a fine and private place,
But none, I think, do there embrace.
—Andrew Marvell, ""To His Coy Mistress""
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) understatement (1) paradox
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) paradox**. Here's why:

* **Paradox:** A statement that seems contradictory or absurd but may be true. 

In the excerpt, Marvell creates a paradox by stating that the grave is a ""fine and private place."" While a grave might be private, it's not typically considered ""fine"" in the sense of being pleasant or desirable. This creates a tension that makes the reader think about the irony of death.

Let's look at why the other option isn't a good fit:

* **Understatement:** A figure of speech that deliberately downplays the importance or significance of something. This isn't present in the excerpt. Marvell is not downplaying the importance of the grave, but rather making a pointed observation about it.

 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two summer squash plants."	"The answer is **(3) 3:1**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The Punnett square shows the possible combinations of alleles in the offspring. The genotypes are LL, Ll, Ll, and ll. 
* **Phenotype:**  The 'L' allele is dominant, meaning even one 'L' will result in fuzzy leaves.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) AA (1) having agouti fur
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.
Oliver, a cat from this group, has agouti fur. Oliver has two alleles for having agouti fur."	"The correct answer is **(0) AA**. Here's why:

* **The information states that Oliver has agouti fur.** This means he must have at least one copy of the dominant 'A' allele.

a piece of apple turning brown
bleaching clothes
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **An apple turning brown** is a chemical reaction called oxidation. The apple's flesh reacts with oxygen in the air, changing its chemical composition and causing the browning. 
* **Bleaching clothes** involves a chemical reaction that breaks down the colored molecules in the fabric, making them lighter. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are only physical changes.**  Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical makeup.  Browning and bleaching involve changes in the chemical makeup.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling.**  Neither of these processes is directly caused by cooling.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating.**  While heating can sometimes accelerate chemical reactions, it's not the primary cause of either browning or bleaching. 

**Therefore, the commonality between these changes is that they are both chemical changes.**

 Hint: Figure: Kibale National Forest.
Kibale National Forest is a tropical rain forest ecosystem in Uganda, a country in eastern Africa."	"The answer is **(0) It has year-round rain. It also has many different types of organisms.**

Here's why:

* **Tropical rainforests** are known for their high rainfall throughout the year.
* **Biodiversity** is a hallmark of tropical rainforests. They have a vast variety of plants and animals.

The second choice is incorrect because:

* **Tropical rainforests** do not have cold winters. They are located in equatorial regions with consistent warm temperatures.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kylie. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie.
 Hint: Kylie is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kylie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kylie with a force of 1,200N."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kylie.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:**  Balanced forces occur when the forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 
* **Net Force:** The net force is the overall force acting on an object. If forces are balanced, the net force is zero.
* **Kylie's Situation:**
    * Gravity is pulling Kylie down with 600N.
    * The seat is pushing Kylie up with 1200N. 
    * These forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. 

Since the forces are balanced, there is no net force on Kylie. This means Kylie will not accelerate (start moving, stop moving, or change direction) even though the roller coaster is moving.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is **(0) The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. 
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a distance of 5 inches between the magnets, while Pair 2 has a distance of 2 inches. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger. 

Therefore, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2."	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Rust forming on a bicycle frame:** This is a chemical reaction called oxidation. Iron in the bicycle frame reacts with oxygen in the air, forming iron oxide (rust). The composition of the metal changes.

* **Grilling a hamburger:**  The heat from the grill causes chemical reactions within the hamburger meat. Proteins denature (change structure), fats melt, and sugars caramelize. These changes alter the composition of the hamburger.

**Let's eliminate the other choices:**

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling.**  This is incorrect; rusting is typically caused by exposure to moisture and oxygen, and grilling involves heating.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes.** This is incorrect because the composition of the substances is altered in both cases.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating.** This is partially correct for grilling, but rusting can occur at room temperature and even in cold environments.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 16 liters (1) 16 milliliters
 Hint: Select the better estimate."	"The answer is **(1) 16 milliliters**. Here's why:

* **Test tubes are small:** They are designed for holding and mixing small amounts of liquids in laboratory settings.
* **Liters are too large:** A liter is a very large volume (about the same as a standard water bottle). 
* **Milliliters are a better fit:** Milliliters are much smaller units of volume, making them more appropriate for the size of a test tube. 

Therefore, 16 milliliters is a much better estimate for the volume of a typical test tube.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is (2). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and the strength of their poles.  
* **Like Poles Repel:**  In both pairs, the magnets have their like poles facing each other (S-S and N-N). Like poles repel each other.
* **Distance:** The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. 
* **Conclusion:** Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger. 

Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Milk going sour:**  This is a chemical change. Bacteria in the milk convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid, causing the sour taste and change in texture. 
* **Roasting a marshmallow over a campfire:** This is also a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the sugar in the marshmallow to caramelize and the proteins to brown.  This results in a change in flavor, color, and texture.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling is not the cause of either change. Milk goes sour due to bacterial activity, and marshmallows are roasted by heat.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:**  While roasting a marshmallow is caused by heating, milk going sour is primarily caused by bacterial activity, which is not directly related to heat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian's mouth was literally on fire by the time he finished his meal. (1) The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.**

Here's why:

* **""Literally"" in its traditional sense means something is actually happening, without exaggeration.**  In choice (1), Julian *actually* had to drink three glasses of milk. The statement is not figurative or hyperbolic. 

* **Choice (0) uses ""literally"" figuratively.**  Julian's mouth wasn't actually on fire. The phrase is an exaggeration used to describe the intense burning sensation he felt. 

Therefore, choice (1) uses ""literally"" in its traditional sense, while choice (0) uses it in a figurative sense.

 Choices: (0) Susan McKee is an ace reporter, so it was not surprising that she was nominated for an award. (1) Susan McKee is an excellent reporter, so it came as no surprise when her work was nominated for an award.
 Hint: N/A"	"The more formal sentence is **(1) Susan McKee is an excellent reporter, so it came as no surprise when her work was nominated for an award.**

Here's why:

* **""Excellent"" is a more formal word than ""ace.""**  ""Ace"" is more informal and slang-like.
* **""Came as no surprise"" is more formal than ""was not surprising.""**  The latter is more conversational and less precise.

While both sentences convey the same meaning, sentence (1) uses more formal language and structure, making it a better choice for formal writing.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Tomorrow the actors will practice their lines onstage. (1) I pretend to be a knight, and Jeanette pretends to be an astronaut.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) I pretend to be a knight, and Jeanette pretends to be an astronaut.**

Here's why:

* **Compound sentences** are made up of two or more independent clauses joined together by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" etc.). 

Let's break down the sentences:

* **(0) Tomorrow the actors will practice their lines onstage.** This is a simple sentence with one independent clause.
* **(1) I pretend to be a knight, and Jeanette pretends to be an astronaut.** This sentence has two independent clauses (""I pretend to be a knight"" and ""Jeanette pretends to be an astronaut"") connected by the coordinating conjunction ""and.""

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnets, the distance between them, and the orientation of their poles. In this case, the magnets in both pairs are made of the same material, so their strength is the same. The distance between the magnets is also the same in both pairs. Finally, the orientation of the poles is the same in both pairs. 

Therefore, the magnetic force between the magnets is the same in both pairs."	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**. Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.

* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** The kinetic energy of a particle is calculated using the equation: KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where:
    * KE = kinetic energy
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle

* **Analyzing the Diagrams:**
    * Sample B has a higher average particle speed (1,300 m/s) compared to sample A (1,100 m/s). 
    * Even though the particles in sample B have a greater mass (46 u) compared to sample A (32 u), the higher speed of particles in sample B results in a higher average kinetic energy for the particles in sample B.

**Conclusion:** Because sample B has a higher average particle speed, it will have a higher average kinetic energy and therefore a higher temperature than sample A.

""That fits you well,"" Bobby remarked after Paula's cap fell over her eyes for the tenth time.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The cap was a good fit. (1) The cap was too big.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) The cap was too big.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that is the opposite of what they mean.
* Bobby says ""That fits you well"" while Paula's cap keeps falling off, meaning it doesn't fit well at all.
* This creates a humorous contrast between what is said and what is actually happening. 

Therefore, Bobby's remark is ironic because it suggests the cap is a good fit when it clearly is not.

271	271	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
mixing sand and water
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Erosion caused by wind:**  Wind carries away particles of soil and rock, changing the shape and form of the land. This is a physical change because the composition of the soil and rock remains the same.
* **Mixing sand and water:** Sand and water are combined, but no new substances are formed. This is a physical change because the sand and water can be separated again.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can sometimes cause erosion (like thermal expansion in rocks), it's not the only cause. Wind erosion can happen regardless of temperature.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. Neither erosion nor mixing sand and water result in new substances.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling can cause some types of erosion (like frost wedging), but it's not the cause of wind erosion or simple mixing.

273	273	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree."	"The answer is **(1) mutualistic**. Here's why:

* **Mutualistic:** Both organisms benefit from the relationship. The megabat gets food (the fig) and the fig tree benefits from seed dispersal, which helps it reproduce and spread.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **Parasitic:** One organism benefits at the expense of the other. This isn't the case here, as both the bat and the fig tree benefit.
* **Commensal:** One organism benefits, and the other is neither helped nor harmed. While the bat benefits, the fig tree also benefits from seed dispersal, so this isn't commensalism.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnets.**  This means that as the distance between magnets increases, the magnetic force decreases significantly.
* **Pair 1 has a larger separation (0.65 cm) than Pair 2 (0.3 cm).** 
* **Therefore, the magnetic force will be weaker in Pair 1 due to the greater distance.**

* **The Key Information:** The problem states that both samples have the same average particle speed. Since kinetic energy depends on both mass and speed (KE = 1/2 * mv^2), and both samples have the same average speed, the sample with the higher average kinetic energy will be the one with the particles that have a higher mass.
* **Comparing the Masses:** Sample A's particles have a mass of 44 u, while Sample B's particles have a mass of 30 u. 
* **Conclusion:** Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy, meaning it has a higher temperature. However, the question specifically asks about the average kinetic energies, not the temperature, so the correct answer is (1), neither."	natural science

 Hint: Figure: Peary Land.
Peary Land is a tundra ecosystem in northern Greenland."	"The answer is **(0) It has mostly small plants. It also has short, cold summers.**

Here's why:

* **Tundra ecosystems** are known for their cold, harsh conditions. They have very short growing seasons with cold summers and long, harsh winters.
* **Limited plant life:** The frozen ground and limited sunlight restrict the types of plants that can thrive. Small, low-growing plants are more common.

 Hint: In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for brown eyes, and the allele e is for red eyes.
Bianca, a guinea pig from this group, has brown eyes. Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes."	"The answer is **(1) EE**. Here's why:

* **Brown eyes are dominant:** The information states that the allele E (brown eyes) is dominant over the allele e (red eyes). This means that if an individual has at least one E allele, they will have brown eyes.
* **Bianca has brown eyes:**  We know Bianca has brown eyes.
* **Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes:**  This means she must have two E alleles, because even one E allele would give her brown eyes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer: (2) sample A

The average kinetic energy of a particle is given by:

KE = 1/2 * mv^2

where:

* KE is the kinetic energy
* m is the mass of the particle
* v is the speed of the particle

The particles in sample A have a higher average speed (1,800 m/s) than the particles in sample B (1,700 m/s). Since the mass of the particles in sample A is also slightly higher than the particles in sample B, the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is higher. Therefore, sample A has a higher temperature."	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Both pairs have the same distance (4.7 cm) between their magnets.
* **Magnetic Force and Pole Strength:** The strength of the magnetic force is also proportional to the product of the pole strengths of the magnets. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, their pole strengths are the same.

Therefore, both pairs have the same distance and the same pole strengths, leading to the same magnitude of magnetic force.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Hakim. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim.
 Hint: Hakim is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Hakim with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Hakim with a force of 400N."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:**  Balanced forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. 
* **Hakim's Situation:** Gravity pulls Hakim down with 400N, and the diving board pushes him up with 400N. These forces are equal and opposite.
* **Net Force:**  When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out. This means the net force on Hakim is zero.

Since Hakim is standing still on the diving board, we know he is not accelerating. This is a strong indication that the forces on him are balanced.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a school bus carrying 600 pounds (1) a school bus carrying 500 pounds
 Hint: Kids from two different schools are riding their school buses home. The buses are the same. They are going the same speed. But different numbers of kids are riding in each bus."	"The answer is **(0) a school bus carrying 600 pounds**. Here's why:

* **Newton's Second Law of Motion:**  This law states that force is directly proportional to mass and acceleration.  
* **More Mass, More Force:**  The heavier bus (carrying 600 pounds) has more mass. Since both buses need to stop in the same amount of time, they have the same deceleration (negative acceleration). To achieve that same deceleration with a larger mass, you need a larger force. 

**In simpler terms:** Imagine trying to stop a small bike versus a heavy truck going the same speed. You'd need to push much harder on the truck to get it to stop in the same amount of time.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** Magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.  
* **Comparing the Pairs:** The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. 

Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer, the magnetic force between them will be stronger. This means the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy fleece (1) a woolly fleece
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
Sage is a sheep from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype FF for the fleece type gene."	"The answer is **(0) a hairy fleece**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Sage has the genotype FF, which means she has two copies of the dominant ""F"" allele for hairy fleece.
* **Dominant Allele:**  The ""F"" allele is dominant over the ""f"" allele. This means that if an individual has at least one ""F"" allele, they will express the hairy fleece trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metamorphic (1) igneous
 Hint: Marble is a type of rock. It is used as a building material in many parts of the world. Marble forms when limestone is changed by heating and squeezing."	"The answer is **(0) metamorphic**. 

Here's why:

* **Metamorphic rocks** are formed when existing rocks (igneous, sedimentary, or even other metamorphic rocks) are transformed by heat, pressure, or chemical reactions. Marble specifically forms when limestone (a sedimentary rock) undergoes these changes.

* **Igneous rocks** are formed from the cooling and solidification of molten rock (magma or lava).

pouring milk on oatmeal
water evaporating from a puddle
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Pouring milk on oatmeal:** This is a physical change because it involves a change in the state of the milk (liquid to mixed with oatmeal), but not a change in the chemical composition of the milk or the oatmeal.
* **Water evaporating from a puddle:** This is also a physical change. The water is changing state from liquid to gas (water vapor), but the chemical composition (H₂O) remains the same. 

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can cause evaporation, pouring milk on oatmeal doesn't necessarily involve heating.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:** Cooling might slow down evaporation, but neither process is directly caused by cooling.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. Neither pouring milk nor evaporation create new substances.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bat star (1) kelp (2) kelp bass (3) black rockfish
 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	"The answer is (2) kelp bass. Here's why:

* **Food Webs:** Food webs show how energy and matter flow through an ecosystem. Arrows indicate the direction of energy transfer (what eats what).
* **Sea Cucumber:** The sea cucumber eats the bat star.
* **Kelp Bass:**  The kelp bass is eaten by the bat star.

 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(0) Walter's ill-researched essay about the Space Race received a poor grade because it presented such a travesty of the actual historical events.**

Here's why:

* **Travesty** in its traditional sense means a distorted or grossly misrepresented version of something.  
* In choice (0), the essay is described as a ""travesty"" because it misrepresents the actual historical events of the Space Race. This aligns with the traditional meaning of the word.

 Choices: (0) Coach Yamamoto talked to her team before the game. (1) Janelle blows big bubbles, Damon pops them.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Janelle blows big bubbles, Damon pops them.**

Here's why:

* **Run-on sentences** occur when two or more independent clauses (complete sentences) are joined together without proper punctuation or conjunctions. 

* In choice (1), ""Janelle blows big bubbles"" and ""Damon pops them"" are both complete sentences. They are joined only by a comma, which is not enough to correctly connect them.

 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (0).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle
* **Equal Speeds, Different Masses:**  Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,600 m/s). However, the particles in sample A have a higher mass (40 u) than those in sample B (26 u).
* **Equal Average KE:** Since both samples have the same speed, but the higher mass of the particles in sample A is offset by their lower number, the average kinetic energies of the particles in both samples are the same.

**Therefore, the samples have the same temperature.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the cup of black tea with more thermal energy (1) the cup of black tea with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two 350-gram cups of black tea are identical except for their thermal energies."	"The answer is **(0) the cup of black tea with more thermal energy**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total energy of the particles within a substance. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those particles.

The more thermal energy a substance has, the faster its particles are moving on average.  This means the higher the temperature. 

Since both cups of tea are identical except for their thermal energies, the one with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature.

When the eggs hatch, the father frog carries the tadpoles to water. (1) Canadian lynx have furry, padded feet that help them walk on snow. Canadian lynx feed their offspring milk.
 Hint: Amphibians are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify amphibians:
They spend part of their lives in water and part on land.
They have moist skin.
They make eggs with no shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions."	"The answer is **(0) Red-headed poison frogs**. Here's why:

* **They spend part of their lives in water and part on land:** The description states the father frog carries the tadpoles to water, indicating a transition from an aquatic (tadpole) stage to a terrestrial (frog) stage.
* **They have moist skin:** The description says they have ""moist, smooth skin"".

 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) At the grocery store, Martina hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food.**

Here's why:

* **""Random"" in its traditional sense means something happens without a specific pattern or plan.** In choice (1), Martina's selection of fruits and vegetables is described as random, implying she didn't choose them with a specific list or purpose in mind.

* **Choice (0) uses ""random"" in a more casual sense, meaning unexpected or unplanned.** Martina's trip to the grocery store was unexpected, but it doesn't necessarily imply a lack of pattern or plan in the selection of items.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes."	"The correct answer is (1). Here's why:

* **The Magnetic Force:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **The strength of the magnets:**  Magnets with stronger magnetic fields exert a stronger force.
    * **The distance between the magnets:** The closer the magnets, the stronger the force.
    * **The orientation of the magnets:** Opposite poles attract (N-S), while like poles repel (N-N or S-S).

* **Analyzing the Pairs:**
    * **Pair 1:** The magnets are relatively small and a bit further apart.

 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are caused by heating.** Here's why:

* **Carving a piece of wood:** This is a physical change. You're changing the shape of the wood, but not its chemical composition. However, the act of carving often involves using tools that generate heat through friction, which contributes to the change.
* **Water boiling on a stove:** This is a physical change (liquid to gas), but it's directly caused by the heat from the stove.

Let's look at the other options:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:** Incorrect.  Only boiling water involves a change in state (liquid to gas), which is a physical change.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:** Incorrect. While both are physical changes, the process of carving often involves heat.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:** Incorrect. Both changes are caused by heating. 

**Therefore, the commonality between carving wood and water boiling is that both processes are caused by heating.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The temperature was too warm. (1) The temperature was too cool.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) The temperature was too cool**. 

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that is the opposite of what they actually mean. 
* Lexi is complaining about the heat, but she is sweating, indicating that the temperature is actually quite warm. This is ironic because she is saying she needs the heat turned on, when in reality, the temperature is already too high.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) There was a benefit to Devin's job loss.**

Here's why:

* **The metaphor:** The text uses the metaphor of a ""sea of darkness"" to represent the overwhelming sadness and negativity Devin felt after losing his job. 
* **The light:**  The ""light in the sea of darkness"" is the prospect of pursuing a new career. This suggests that even though losing his job was a difficult experience, the possibility of starting something new offered a glimmer of hope and a path forward. 

Therefore, the metaphor suggests that while Devin's job loss was a negative event, it also presented an opportunity for him to explore new possibilities, which is a benefit.

Covering its eggs with its body increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the leech's eggs will hatch (1) the leech will not eat for up to a week (2) the leech will fight a water snail
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After  reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream. The leech then flattens its body over its eggs to protect them. The leech protects its eggs until they hatch, which takes four to seven days. During this time, the leech does not leave the eggs or eat.
Water snails are predators that eat leech eggs. The snails easily eat eggs that are not covered by an adult leech. But snails cannot easily get to eggs that are covered by a leech.
Figure: a snail leech."	"The answer is **(0) the leech's eggs will hatch**. Here's why:

* **Protection from Predators:** The passage clearly states that water snails prey on leech eggs. The leech covering its eggs with its body makes it difficult for the snails to reach and eat them. This increases the likelihood that the eggs will survive until they hatch. 

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(1) the leech will not eat for up to a week:** While the leech does not eat during this time, this is a consequence of protecting its eggs, not a direct reason for its reproductive success. 
* **(2) the leech will fight a water snail:** The passage does not mention the leech fighting snails. The leech's strategy is to protect its eggs by covering them, not by directly confronting the predator.

—Forrest Gump
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Life is luxurious. (1) Life is unpredictable.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Life is unpredictable.**

Here's why:

* **Simile:**  A simile uses ""like"" or ""as"" to compare two different things. In this case, life is being compared to a box of chocolates.
* **Unpredictability:**  The key element of the simile is the idea that you ""never know what you're gonna get"" from a box of chocolates. This directly translates to the idea that life is full of surprises, both good and bad, that you can't always anticipate.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is **(1) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on two factors:
    * **Distance:** The closer the magnets, the stronger the force.
    * **Strength of the magnets:**  Magnets with a stronger magnetic field exert a stronger force.

* **In this case:**
    * Both pairs have magnets made of the same material, meaning their magnetic field strength is the same.
    * However, Pair 1 has a smaller distance between its magnets (16 mm) compared to Pair 2 (27 mm).

* **Conclusion:**  Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a reddish-brown coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Astro is a horse from this group. Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene."	"The correct answer is **(0) a black coat**. Here's why:

* **Heterozygous genotype:** Astro has the genotype Ll, meaning he has one dominant allele (L) for black coat and one recessive allele (l) for reddish-brown coat.
* **Dominant allele:** Since the black coat allele (L) is dominant, it will express itself even when paired with a recessive allele. This means Astro will have a black coat despite having the recessive allele for reddish-brown.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the plants watered with tap water (1) the plants watered with greywater
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Patty wanted to find ways to save water. She learned that people can reuse greywater, which is water that has been used in sinks, tubs, and washing machines. She wondered if her plants would be less healthy if she watered them with greywater instead of tap water.
Patty placed eight potted petunia plants on her windowsill. For three months, she watered four of the plants with greywater and the other four with tap water. At the end of three months, she counted the number of dead leaves on each plant.
Figure: watering petunia plants."	"The answer is **(0) the plants watered with tap water**.

Here's why:

* **Control group:** A control group in an experiment is a group that does not receive the treatment being tested.  This group helps scientists determine if the treatment is truly responsible for any changes observed.
* **In this experiment:** Patty is testing the effect of greywater on plant health.  The plants watered with tap water represent the control group because they receive the standard treatment (regular water).  They are the baseline for comparison. 
* **The other group:** The plants watered with greywater are the experimental group, as they are receiving the treatment being tested.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Sewing an apron:** This is a physical change. You're altering the shape and form of the fabric, but not changing its chemical composition. 
* **Water evaporating from a lake:** This is also a physical change.  Water is changing state from liquid to gas (water vapor), but it's still H2O. The chemical composition remains the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can cause evaporation, it's not the only way. Evaporation can happen at room temperature. Sewing an apron isn't related to heating.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. Neither sewing nor evaporation create new substances.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cactus.
 Hint: Ariana is picking up her potted cactus as she cleans her room. She is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20N. Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15N."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cactus.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:** When forces on an object are balanced, they cancel each other out. This means the object either stays still (if it was already stationary) or continues moving at a constant speed in the same direction (if it was already in motion).
* **Net Force:** The net force is the overall force acting on an object.  If forces are balanced, the net force is zero.

In this scenario:

* Ariana pulls the cactus up with 20N.
* Gravity pulls the cactus down with 15N.

Since these forces are in opposite directions, they partially cancel each other out.  However, the upward force (20N) is greater than the downward force (15N), so the cactus will accelerate upwards.  

**Therefore, the forces are NOT balanced, and there IS a net force on the cactus.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) colder (1) warmer
 Hint: When a chemical reaction absorbs or releases thermal energy, the reaction causes a change in temperature. Read the passage about a chemical reaction that absorbs or releases thermal energy. Then, follow the instructions below.
The most common type of cement in the world is Portland cement, named after an area of England that has a lot of limestone. Limestone is made up mostly of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). When calcium carbonate is heated, it breaks down into carbon dioxide (CO2) and calcium oxide (CaO), the main ingredient in Portland cement. During this reaction, thermal energy is taken in from the surroundings and converted to chemical energy."	"The correct answer is **(0) colder**.

Here's why:

* **Endothermic Reactions:** The reaction described is an endothermic reaction. This means it absorbs heat from its surroundings.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Evaporation:** Water changing from a liquid to a gas (water vapor) is a physical change. The chemical composition of water (H₂O) remains the same.
* **Ice Crystal Formation:** Water freezing into ice is also a physical change. The water molecules arrange themselves differently, but the chemical formula (H₂O) remains the same.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:**  Evaporation is caused by heating, but ice crystal formation is caused by cooling.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:** While ice crystal formation is caused by cooling, evaporation is caused by heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pale orange cheeks (1) bright orange cheeks
 Hint: In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
Jack is a cockatiel from this group. Jack has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) bright orange cheeks**.

Here's why:

* **Heterozygous genotype:** Jack's genotype Rr means he has one dominant allele (R) for bright orange cheeks and one recessive allele (r) for pale orange cheeks.

713	713	"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
When I was in Seattle for a week last January, it didn't rain even once. Seattle's reputation for being rainy is obviously false.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other (2) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) hasty generalization**. 

Here's why:

* **Hasty generalization** occurs when someone draws a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. In this case, the speaker experienced one week of dry weather in Seattle and concluded that Seattle's reputation for rain is false.  One week is a tiny sample size compared to the entire year, making their conclusion a hasty generalization.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **Guilt by association:** This fallacy involves associating someone or something with negative qualities to discredit them. It's not present here.
* **False causation:** This fallacy assumes a causal relationship between two events that are simply coincidental.  The speaker isn't suggesting that their visit to Seattle *caused* the lack of rain.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (2).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** The average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature.
* **Equal Average Speeds:** Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,000 m/s).
* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where m is mass and v is velocity.  Since both samples have the same average velocity, their average kinetic energy will be determined by their masses.
* **Mass and Temperature:** Even though the masses of the particles are different, the average kinetic energy of the particles (and therefore their temperature) will be the same because the average particle speeds are the same.

 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele F is for bumpy fruit, and the allele f is for smooth fruit.
A certain cucumber plant from this group has smooth fruit. This plant has two alleles for smooth fruit."	"The correct answer is **(1) smooth fruit**. Here's why:

* **Phenotype:** This refers to the observable traits of an organism, like smooth or bumpy fruit.
* **Genotype:** This refers to the genetic makeup of an organism, in this case, the combination of alleles for fruit texture (Ff, FF, or ff).

The question states that the plant has **smooth fruit**. This is the observable trait, making it the **phenotype**. 

While the hint tells us the plant has two alleles for smooth fruit, it doesn't specify the exact genotype (ff).  The phenotype is what we directly observe, and in this case, it's **smooth fruit**.

""Sleeping through the rooster's crowing was no problem,"" Jeffrey joked with a yawn.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Jeffrey slept well. (1) Jeffrey slept poorly.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Jeffrey slept poorly**. 

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that contradicts their true meaning. 
* The rooster's crowing is typically associated with an early wake-up call. 
* Jeffrey's statement that he ""slept through the rooster's crowing"" implies he had a difficult time waking up.
* The fact that he's yawning suggests he's tired, further supporting the idea he didn't sleep well.

The joke is that he's exaggerating his ability to sleep through the crowing, implying he actually struggled to wake up.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 3:1 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the Huntington's disease trait in humans:
Huntington's disease is a condition that causes the death of brain cells over time. This loss of cells interferes with brain function and may lead to uncontrolled movements, difficulty thinking, and changes in behavior.
In a group of humans, some individuals have Huntington's disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Huntington's disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive to the allele for having Huntington's disease (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two humans."	"The answer is **(1) 3:1**. Here's why:

* **Understanding the Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows the possible combinations of alleles from the parents.  Each parent contributes one allele to their offspring.
* **Dominant and Recessive Alleles:** The 'H' allele (Huntington's disease) is dominant. This means an individual with even one 'H' allele will have the disease. The 'h' allele (no Huntington's disease) is recessive. An individual needs two 'h' alleles to not have the disease.
* **Interpreting the Results:**
    * **Hh:** This genotype will result in Huntington's disease.
    * **hh:** This genotype will not result in Huntington's disease.

The Punnett square shows:
* 2 offspring with the Hh genotype (Huntington's disease)
* 2 offspring with the hh genotype (no Huntington's disease)

This gives a ratio of 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. However, since the question asks for the ratio of offspring **without** Huntington's to those **with**, we reverse the order to **3:1**.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	"The answer is (0). 

Here's why:

* **Food Webs:** Food webs show how energy and matter flow through an ecosystem.  Arrows point from the organism that is eaten to the organism that eats it.

 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Dasher is a horse from this group. Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) a black coat**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL. This means she has two copies of the dominant allele (L) for black coat color.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for reddish-brown coat (l).  This means that if an individual has at least one copy of the L allele, they will express the black coat phenotype.

Since Dasher has two copies of the dominant L allele, she will have a black coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that as the distance between the magnets increases, the force decreases rapidly.
* **Equal Distance:**  In both pairs, the magnets are separated by 8.8 mm. 
* **Equal Magnetic Poles:** Both pairs have a north pole facing a south pole. This configuration results in an attractive force.

Since the distance and the orientation of the poles are the same in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will also be the same.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bottles with lids kept on (1) the bottles with lids taken off
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Steve wanted to freeze soda to make popsicles. He knew that soda contains carbon dioxide gas, which forms bubbles as it escapes from the liquid. He wondered if the popsicles would freeze more quickly if he removed the carbon dioxide.
Steve took the lids off three small bottles of soda. He left the lids off overnight so that carbon dioxide could escape from the bottles. He kept the lids on three other bottles to keep the carbon dioxide in. The next morning, Steve placed all six bottles in the freezer. After two hours, he checked whether soda in any of the bottles had frozen.
Figure: soda with carbon dioxide bubbles."	"The answer is **(1) the bottles with lids taken off**.

Here's why:

* **Experimental Group:** The experimental group is the group that receives the treatment being tested. In this experiment, Steve wanted to see if removing the carbon dioxide affected freezing time.  The bottles with lids taken off were the ones where the carbon dioxide was allowed to escape. This is the treatment being tested.
* **Control Group:** The control group serves as a baseline for comparison.  The bottles with lids kept on didn't have their carbon dioxide removed, making them the control group. 

The experiment was designed to compare the freezing time of soda with and without carbon dioxide to see if there was a difference.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(0) a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 87°F**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of an object due to its temperature. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object has. 
* Since all the bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperatures, the one with the lowest temperature (87°F) will have the least thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) fuzzy fruit (1) smooth fruit
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
A certain tomato plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene."	"The correct answer is **(0) fuzzy fruit**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype **ff**. This means it has two recessive alleles (f) for the fruit texture trait.
* **Dominance:** The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant, meaning that if a plant has at least one F allele, it will have smooth fruit.
* **Recessive Expression:**  Since the plant has only the recessive allele (f), it will express the recessive trait, which is **fuzzy fruit**.

 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes."	"The correct answer is (0). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Strength of the magnets:**  Magnets made of the same material have similar strengths.
    * **Distance between the magnets:** Closer magnets experience stronger forces.
    * **Orientation of the magnets:** Opposite poles attract, like poles repel.

* **Analysis:**
    * **Pair 1:** The magnets are closer together, with the north pole of one magnet directly opposite the south pole of the other. This is a strong attraction.
    * **Pair 2:** The magnets are the same distance apart, but the poles are not aligned directly opposite each other. This reduces the strength of the attraction compared to Pair 1.

 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Kraken is a guppy from this group. Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene."	"The answer is **(0) a spotted tail**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Kraken has the genotype II, which means he has two copies of the dominant allele (I) for spotted tails.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant. This means that even with just one copy of the I allele, the guppy will have a spotted tail.
* **Phenotype:** The phenotype is the physical expression of the genotype. Since Kraken has two copies of the dominant allele, his phenotype will be a spotted tail.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Latrell.
 Hint: Latrell is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Latrell with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Latrell with a force of 400N."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:**  When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out. In this case, the force of gravity pulling Latrell down (400N) is exactly countered by the force of the diving board pushing up on Latrell (400N).

* **Net Force:**  The net force is the overall force acting on an object.  When forces are balanced, the net force is zero.

Since the forces are balanced, Latrell is not accelerating (either speeding up or slowing down). He is likely standing still on the diving board.

 Hint: Two movers are putting heavy boxes into their truck. The boxes are the same shape and size. Each mover lifts one box up into the truck at a time."	"The answer is **(0) a box holding 42 pounds**. Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:** Force is needed to overcome gravity and lift an object. The heavier the object, the more force is required.
* **Weight is a measure of force:** Weight is directly related to the force of gravity acting on an object's mass.  

Since the 42-pound box is heavier than the 39-pound box, the movers need to exert a larger force to lift it.

* **Homozygous genotype:** Salem has the genotype 'aa', which means she has two copies of the recessive allele.
* **Phenotype:** Since Salem has two copies of the recessive allele, her phenotype (observable trait) is **not having agouti fur**.

When Carson arrived at Heathrow Airport, a British man helped him retrieve his luggage from baggage claim. British people are all so nice!
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations (2) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) hasty generalization**. Here's why:

* **The statement makes a sweeping conclusion about all British people based on a single positive encounter.**  It's a classic example of jumping to conclusions without sufficient evidence. 

Let's break down why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **(0) Guilt by association:** This fallacy links a person or thing to something negative, which isn't happening here. The statement is positive.
* **(2) Appeal to nature:**  This fallacy argues that something is good because it's natural. There's no mention of nature in the statement.

 Hint: Figure: Sonoran Desert.
The Sonoran Desert is a hot desert ecosystem in the southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico."	"The answer is **(0) It has a small amount of rain. It also has dry, thin soil.** 

Here's why:

* **Deserts are known for their low rainfall:** This is a defining characteristic of desert ecosystems.
* **Soil in deserts is often dry and thin:**  The lack of rainfall and frequent erosion contribute to this.

Choice (1) is incorrect because deserts are not known for having soil that is frozen year-round. This is more characteristic of tundra or arctic ecosystems.

Your elderly grandmother wants a dog for companionship, yet you don't want to get her one. Why do you want your grandmother to be sad and lonely?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) red herring: the use of a completely unrelated topic or idea
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) straw man**. 

Here's why:

* **The fallacy:** The argument presented doesn't actually address the reason you might not want to get your grandmother a dog. Instead, it misrepresents your position by suggesting you *want* her to be sad and lonely, which is an extreme and untrue characterization. 

Let's break it down:

* **The actual issue:** You might have valid reasons for not getting your grandmother a dog, such as:
    * **Responsibility:** You may not be able to handle the additional responsibility of caring for a dog.
    * **Health concerns:** Your grandmother's health might not be suitable for a pet.
    * **Living arrangements:** Her living space might not be appropriate for a dog.
* **The straw man:** The argument ignores these potential reasons and instead paints you as someone who actively desires your grandmother's unhappiness.

By twisting your position into a false and extreme one, the argument makes it easier to attack and dismiss your point of view.

I can't believe you'd hire Jake Perry to watch your dog! Did you know that his friend adopted a dog but then took it back to the shelter after just one week?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument attempts to discredit Jake Perry by associating him with a negative action (taking a dog back to the shelter).**  The argument doesn't directly say Jake Perry would do the same, but implies it by focusing on the actions of his friend. 
* **There's no evidence that Jake Perry is a bad dog sitter.** The argument relies solely on the association with his friend's actions to make a judgment. 

Let's break down why the other choice is incorrect:

* **(1) Hasty generalization:** This fallacy involves making a broad conclusion based on limited evidence. While the argument does make a judgment about Jake Perry, it's not based on a generalization about all people who have friends who return dogs to shelters.

Here's why:

* **Cost is about what you give up.** In economics, a cost isn't just about money. It's also about the opportunity cost – the value of the next best alternative you forgo.
* **Samuel's decision involves a trade-off.** He can either go to California or South Carolina. Choosing one means giving up the other.
* **The cost is the missed opportunity.**  Since Samuel would have enjoyed South Carolina more, giving up that trip is a cost to him, even if it means saving money.

* **Cost vs. Benefit:** In economics, a cost is something that uses up resources or time. A benefit is something positive you gain. 
* **Stacy's Dilemma:**  Stacy has a limited amount of time at the zoo before it closes.  
* **Walking Time as a Cost:**  Walking to the meerkats takes longer than walking to the monkeys. This means she'll have less time to see other animals.

 Choices: (0) stayed the same (1) decreased (2) increased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
On a snowy day, Candice rode her sled down a big hill."	"The correct answer is **(1) decreased**. Here's why:

* **Gravitational Potential Energy:** This is the energy an object possesses due to its position relative to a gravitational field.  The higher an object is, the more potential energy it has.
* **Candice's Sled:** As Candice rode down the hill, her sled's height decreased.  This means its distance from the Earth's center also decreased.
* **Energy Conversion:** As the sled's height decreased, its gravitational potential energy was converted into kinetic energy (the energy of motion). 

Therefore, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Candice rode down the hill.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The correct answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:**  Opposite poles of magnets attract, while like poles repel. 
* **Pair 1:** The magnets have opposite poles facing each other (S-N and N-S), so they attract.
* **Pair 2:** The magnets have the same poles facing each other (N-S and S-N), so they repel.

**Distance and Strength:**  The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between the magnets increases.  Since the magnets in both pairs are the same distance apart, the distance factor doesn't change the comparison.

* **(1) A sunflower seed is not a pure substance. It is made by a living thing.** Sunflower seeds are produced by a living organism (the sunflower plant). They are not formed through geological processes, so they don't meet the definition of a mineral.
* **(2) Muscovite is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.** Muscovite is a type of mica, a naturally occurring mineral. 

Therefore, the sunflower seed is the only substance that is not a mineral.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The correct answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the distance between them and the strength of their magnetic fields.  
* **Distance:** The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart (21.1 mm) than the magnets in Pair 2 (9.3 mm).
* **Force and Distance:** Since the magnets are made of the same material and have the same strength, the magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart.

Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Josiah will save some time. The crocodiles are close by, but he would have had to walk to the the other side of the zoo to see the emus. (1) Josiah will give up the chance to see the emus. He would have enjoyed seeing them more than the crocodiles.
 Hint: Josiah is deciding whether to see the emus or the crocodiles at the zoo. He wants to see lots of animals, but the zoo is closing soon."	"The correct answer is **(1) Josiah will give up the chance to see the emus. He would have enjoyed seeing them more than the crocodiles.**

Here's why:

* **Cost vs. Benefit:**  A cost is something you give up when you make a choice. In this case, the cost of seeing the crocodiles is that Josiah can't see the emus because of time constraints.
* **Opportunity Cost:** This concept highlights that every choice comes with an opportunity cost.  The opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative that you didn't choose. 

Let's break down why the other option is incorrect:

* **(0) Josiah will save some time. The crocodiles are close by, but he would have had to walk to the the other side of the zoo to see the emus.** This is actually a benefit of seeing the crocodiles, not a cost. It means Josiah can see more animals in the time he has.

 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a black body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies."	"The answer is (4) 0:4. 

Here's why:

* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant. This means that if an individual has at least one ""B"" allele, they will have a gray body.
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows that all possible offspring genotypes are Bb.

 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants."	"The answer is **(3) 3:1**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The Punnett square shows the possible genotypes of the offspring: Gg, Gg, gg, gg.
* **Phenotype:**  Since the allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant, the offspring with genotypes Gg and GG will have climbing growth. Only the offspring with the gg genotype will have bush growth.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (2). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The higher the average kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.

* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle

* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * Sample A has a higher average particle speed (660 m/s) than Sample B (500 m/s). 
    * Even though Sample A's particles have a higher mass (28 u) than Sample B's particles (20 u), the difference in their speeds is significant enough that the average KE of Sample A's particles will be higher.

**Therefore, Sample A has a higher average kinetic energy and thus a higher temperature.**

a penny tarnishing
a piece of apple turning brown
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Tarnishing:** A penny tarnishing is a chemical reaction between the copper in the penny and elements in the air, primarily oxygen. This forms a new substance (copper oxide) which is the greenish layer you see.
* **Apple turning brown:**  This is caused by an enzyme reaction called enzymatic browning.  When an apple is cut, it exposes the inside to oxygen, and the enzyme polyphenol oxidase reacts with the compounds in the apple, changing its color.

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  A physical change alters the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition. The changes described above involve the formation of new substances, making them chemical changes.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:**  While heat can accelerate chemical reactions, it's not the primary cause of tarnishing or apple browning.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling generally slows down chemical reactions, not speeds them up. 

**Therefore, the commonality between these changes is that they are both chemical changes.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Boxer is a cow from this group. Boxer has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."	"The answer is **(1) a black coat**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Boxer's genotype is LL, meaning he has two copies of the dominant allele (L) for black coat color.
* **Dominant Allele:**  The allele for black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for red coat (l). This means that if an individual has at least one copy of the L allele, they will have a black coat.

dust settling out of the air
melting wax
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Dust settling out of the air:** This is a physical change. The dust particles are simply changing their position, not their chemical composition. 
* **Melting wax:** This is also a physical change. The wax is changing state from solid to liquid, but its chemical makeup remains the same. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating.**  While melting wax requires heat, dust settling is often caused by gravity and air currents, not necessarily heating.
* **(1) Both are chemical changes.** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. Neither dust settling nor melting wax involve a change in chemical composition.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling.**  Cooling can cause condensation (water vapor turning into liquid), but it's not the main factor in dust settling or melting wax.

carving a piece of wood
dust settling out of the air
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Carving wood:** This is a physical change because you are changing the shape and size of the wood, but not its chemical composition. The wood remains wood.
* **Dust settling out of the air:** This is also a physical change. The dust particles are simply changing their position due to gravity, not undergoing a chemical reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties.  Neither carving wood nor dust settling change the fundamental composition of the materials.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither of these changes are directly caused by cooling. Carving is a mechanical process, and dust settling is due to gravity.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  Heating might be involved in some wood carving processes, but it's not the primary cause of the change. Dust settling is not related to heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) wavy fur (1) straight fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Nutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene."	"The correct answer is **(0) wavy fur**. Here's why:

* **Recessive allele:** The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive. This means that an individual needs two copies of the 'f' allele to express the wavy fur trait.
* **Nutmeg's genotype:** Nutmeg has the genotype 'ff', meaning she has two copies of the recessive allele. 
* **Phenotype:** Since she has two copies of the recessive allele, Nutmeg will express the recessive trait, which is wavy fur.

 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer: (0) sample A

Explanation:
The average kinetic energy of a particle is proportional to its temperature. Kinetic energy is equal to 1/2 * mass * velocity^2. Since both samples have the same mass, the sample with the higher average speed will have a higher kinetic energy and temperature.  Sample A has a higher average particle speed (600 m/s) than sample B (540 m/s), so it will have the higher temperature."	natural science

acid rain weathering a marble statue
chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Acid rain weathering a marble statue:** Acid rain (which is acidic due to dissolved pollutants) reacts chemically with the calcium carbonate in the marble, breaking it down and dissolving it. This is a change in the composition of the marble.
* **Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight:** The chemicals inside a battery undergo a chemical reaction (often involving oxidation and reduction) to produce electrical energy. This involves a change in the chemical makeup of the battery's components.

**Let's look at the other options:**

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is primarily caused by cooling.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:** These are chemical changes, not just physical changes. Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical composition.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  While heating might play a role in some reactions, it's not the primary cause of these specific changes.

**In summary, both acid rain weathering and battery reactions involve changes in the chemical composition of the substances involved, making them chemical changes.**

 Choices: (0) It has salty water. It also has only a few types of organisms. (1) It has bright sunlight. It also has shallow water.
 Hint: Figure: Belize Barrier Reef.
The Belize Barrier Reef is a tropical coral reef ecosystem near the coast of Belize."	"The answer is **(1) It has bright sunlight. It also has shallow water.**

Here's why:

* **Bright sunlight:** Coral reefs thrive in clear, shallow water where sunlight can penetrate. This is essential for the algae (zooxanthellae) that live within coral polyps and provide them with energy.
* **Shallow water:** The Belize Barrier Reef is a shallow-water ecosystem.  This is a key characteristic of coral reefs, as the depth allows for sunlight to reach the corals and supports the diverse marine life that inhabits them. 

**Why the other choice is incorrect:**

* **(0) It has salty water. It also has only a few types of organisms.** While coral reefs are saltwater environments, they are known for their incredible biodiversity.  Coral reefs are among the most diverse ecosystems on Earth, home to a vast array of marine species.

This news show is the most widely watched in the country, so I know it's also the most trustworthy.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct (1) slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences (2) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) bandwagon fallacy**. 

Here's why:

* **Bandwagon fallacy:** This fallacy argues that something must be true or good because many people believe it or do it.  The text states that because the news show is widely watched, it must also be trustworthy. This assumes popularity is a direct indicator of trustworthiness, which is not necessarily true.

Let's eliminate the other options:

* **Slippery slope fallacy:**  This fallacy claims that a small action will inevitably lead to a chain of negative consequences. This isn't present in the text.

* **Straw Man:** A straw man fallacy involves misrepresenting your opponent's argument to make it easier to attack. This argument doesn't misrepresent an opposing view.
* **Hasty Generalization:** This fallacy draws a conclusion based on insufficient evidence. The argument doesn't make a broad claim about the health of all humans; it focuses on the specific evolutionary purpose of teeth.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Raymond shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent. (1) Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.**

Here's why:

* **(0)** uses ""terribly"" to describe the steepness of the slope, implying an extreme or exaggerated degree of steepness. This usage is more figurative and emphasizes the intensity of the slope. 
* **(1)** uses ""terribly"" to describe the intensity of Raymond's shivering. This is the traditional sense of the word, meaning ""very badly"" or ""extremely.""

Therefore, choice (1) is the text that uses ""terribly"" in its traditional sense.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a motorboat that moved 280kilometers south in 5hours (1) a motorboat that moved 60kilometers south in 5hours (2) a motorboat that moved 100kilometers west in 5hours
 Hint: N/A"	"Here's how to determine the fastest motorboat:

**Understanding Speed**

Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken:

* Speed = Distance / Time

**Comparing the Motorboats**

Let's calculate the speed of each motorboat:

* **Motorboat 1:** Speed = 280 km / 5 hours = 56 km/hour
* **Motorboat 2:** Speed = 60 km / 5 hours = 12 km/hour
* **Motorboat 3:** Speed = 100 km / 5 hours = 20 km/hour

**Conclusion**

Motorboat 1, which traveled 280 kilometers south in 5 hours, was moving at the highest speed of 56 km/hour.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) You have to wait in line for a very long time at the passport office.**

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole** is an exaggeration used for emphasis.  The phrase ""an eternity"" is a hyperbole, implying that the wait at the passport office is extremely long. 
* **Choice (1)** is true, but it's not the specific suggestion of the hyperbole.  While the wait might be unpleasant, the hyperbole is focusing on its length.

 Choices: (0) Megan wanted her daughter to have a unique name, so she browsed baby name websites for months to find the perfect one. (1) Megan made all of her daughter's baby clothes by hand, including a unique hand-knitted romper that she designed herself.
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) Megan made all of her daughter's baby clothes by hand, including a unique hand-knitted romper that she designed herself.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional sense of ""unique"":**  The word ""unique"" traditionally means ""being the only one of its kind; unlike anything else."" 
* **Choice (1):** The romper is described as unique because it was hand-knitted and designed by Megan, making it a one-of-a-kind item.
* **Choice (0):**  While Megan might be seeking a name that isn't common, the word ""unique"" is used more in the sense of ""unusual"" or ""original"" rather than truly one-of-a-kind. There are likely other babies with the same name, even if it's not a popular choice.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) euphemism (1) oxymoron
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) oxymoron**.

Here's why:

* **Oxymoron** is a figure of speech that combines two contradictory terms.  In this case, ""deafening silence"" is contradictory because ""deafening"" implies a loud noise, while ""silence"" implies the absence of noise.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Tarnishing:**  A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. The copper in the penny reacts with oxygen and other elements in the air, forming a new substance (copper oxide) that appears as a greenish coating. This is an oxidation reaction.

* **Firing a clay pot:** Firing a clay pot in a kiln is also a chemical change. The heat causes the clay to undergo a chemical transformation. The water molecules in the clay evaporate, and the clay particles fuse together, creating a hardened ceramic material. This is a process of dehydration and sintering.

**Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  Both involve a change in the chemical composition of the materials, making them chemical changes.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While both processes involve heating, they are not solely caused by heating.  The chemical reactions happen because of the heat, but the heat itself isn't the only factor.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white spots (1) aa
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for solid coloring, and the allele a is for white spots.
Buck, a cow from this group, has white spots. Buck has two alleles for white spots."	"The correct answer is **(1) aa**. Here's why:

* **White spots are recessive:** The information states that the allele 'a' is responsible for white spots. This means a cow needs two copies of the 'a' allele to express the white spot trait.
* **Buck has white spots:**  This tells us Buck must have two copies of the recessive 'a' allele. 
* **Genotype:**  A genotype represents the combination of alleles an individual has. Since Buck has two 'a' alleles, his genotype is **aa**.

* **Cost** in economics refers to what you give up when you make a choice. 
* Ted wants the pumpkin spice ice cream more than vanilla bean, so that's not a cost. 
* By choosing pumpkin spice, Ted is giving up the free waffle cone that comes with the vanilla bean ice cream.  Since he enjoys waffle cones, this is a cost (he's giving up something he values).

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The driftwood has a constant velocity. (1) The driftwood is accelerating.
 Hint: A piece of driftwood is floating straight down a stream at a constant speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) The driftwood has a constant velocity.**

Here's why:

* **Velocity** is a combination of speed and direction.
* The driftwood is moving at a **constant speed** down the stream.
* Since it's moving in a **straight line** (down the stream), its direction is also constant.

Therefore, the driftwood has a constant velocity. 

**Acceleration** implies a change in velocity, either in speed or direction.  Since the driftwood is moving at a constant speed and direction, it is not accelerating.

I don't trust Professor Harrell's findings. Another researcher at her university was caught falsifying data. So, it's likely Professor Harrell has, too.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct (2) slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) guilt by association**. 

Here's why:

* **The argument tries to discredit Professor Harrell based solely on the actions of another researcher at the same university.** This creates an association between the two, implying that because one person did something wrong, the other likely did too. 
* **This is illogical because there's no direct evidence linking Professor Harrell to any wrongdoing.** Just because someone works at the same place as someone else who committed misconduct doesn't mean they are guilty themselves. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Bandwagon fallacy:** This fallacy involves appealing to popularity or widespread acceptance to justify a claim.  The argument doesn't rely on popularity.
* **(2) Slippery slope fallacy:** This fallacy argues that one action will inevitably lead to a chain of negative consequences. The argument doesn't suggest a chain of events, only that Professor Harrell is likely guilty because of the association.

 Hint: Figure: Gran Sabana.
The Gran Sabana is a savanna grassland ecosystem in southeastern Venezuela."	"The answer is **(0) It has a rainy season and a dry season. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.**

Here's why:

* **Savannas are known for having distinct wet and dry seasons.**  This is crucial for the unique plant and animal life that thrive in these ecosystems.
* **Savanna soils tend to be nutrient-poor.**  This is due to the combination of heavy rainfall leaching nutrients and the lack of organic matter from decomposition in the dry season. 

Let's look at why choice (1) is incorrect:

* **Savannas do not have year-round rain.** The dry season is a defining characteristic of savannas, allowing for the grasses to thrive and preventing the area from becoming a forest. 

Therefore, the description in choice (0) better reflects the characteristics of a savanna ecosystem, especially the Gran Sabana.

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a system due to its temperature. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within a substance.

Since the gold bars are identical in mass, the one with more thermal energy will have a higher average kinetic energy of its particles, which means it will have a higher temperature.

an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Rotting sandwich:**  This involves the breakdown of organic matter in the sandwich by microorganisms. This is a chemical change because the composition of the sandwich is fundamentally altered, and new substances are formed.
* **Polishing a silver spoon:** While this might seem like a physical change, it involves a chemical reaction. The polish reacts with the tarnish (silver sulfide) on the spoon, converting it into a different compound and removing the discoloration.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are only physical changes:** As explained above, both processes involve chemical changes.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can accelerate some chemical reactions, neither of these changes is directly caused by heating.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling is not the primary factor in either of these changes.

 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer: (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature.

Explanation: Kinetic energy is related to the mass of the particles and the speed at which they are moving. Sample A and Sample B have the same average particle speed (1,400 m/s), which means the average kinetic energy of the particles in the two samples is the same.  The temperature of a sample is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in the sample. Therefore, Sample A and Sample B have the same temperature."	natural science

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle

**Analysis:**

* Both samples have the same average particle speed (720 m/s).
* While the masses of the particles are different, the average speed is the same for both samples.  

**Conclusion:** Since the average speed is the same for both samples, their average kinetic energies will also be the same. Therefore, the samples have the same temperature.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes."	"The answer is (2). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Pole Strength:** Stronger magnets (with more magnetic poles) have a stronger force.
    * **Distance:**  The closer the magnets are, the stronger the force.
    * **Orientation:** Opposite poles (N-S) attract, while like poles (N-N or S-S) repel.

* **Analysis:**
    * Both pairs have the same orientation (opposite poles facing each other) and the same distance between the magnets.
    * Since the magnets are made of the same material, we can assume they have the same pole strength.

* **Conclusion:**  Since all factors influencing the magnetic force are the same, the magnitude of the force is the same in both pairs.

silver jewelry tarnishing
boiling sugar to make caramel
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Silver tarnishing:**  Silver tarnishes when it reacts with sulfur in the air to form silver sulfide, a black compound. This is a new substance being formed, indicating a chemical change.

* **Boiling sugar to make caramel:**  Heating sugar causes its molecules to break down and rearrange, forming new molecules that give caramel its brown color and distinct flavor. This change in chemical composition is a chemical change. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  Both involve a change in chemical composition, making them chemical changes.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While both processes are accelerated by heating, the core change is chemical, not simply due to temperature.
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:** Cooling is not the driving force behind these changes.

**In summary:** Both silver tarnishing and boiling sugar to make caramel involve the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions, making them chemical changes.

* **Euphemism:** A mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt.

In the text, ""old news"" is used as a gentler way of saying ""not news"" or ""something that is no longer surprising.""  The speaker is trying to avoid directly stating that the information is no longer interesting or relevant.

 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** The average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature.  This means a higher average kinetic energy corresponds to a higher temperature.

* **Kinetic Energy and Speed:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated with the equation KE = 1/2 * mv^2, where:
    * m = mass
    * v = velocity (speed)

Since the mass of each particle is the same in both samples, the sample with the higher average particle speed will have a higher average kinetic energy and therefore a higher temperature.

 Choices: (0) the cherry pie with more thermal energy (1) the cherry pie with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two cherry pies are identical except for their thermal energies."	"The answer is **(0) the cherry pie with more thermal energy**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:**  Thermal energy is the total energy of the molecules within an object.  Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of those molecules.
* **More Thermal Energy = Higher Temperature:**  If one cherry pie has more thermal energy, it means its molecules are moving faster on average. This faster movement directly translates to a higher temperature.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Pole Strength:** Stronger magnets have stronger poles, leading to a stronger force.  Since all the magnets are made of the same material, their pole strengths are assumed to be equal.
    * **Distance:** The closer the magnets, the stronger the force. The images show both pairs of magnets are separated by 28.1 mm.

* **Analysis:** Both pairs of magnets have opposite poles facing each other (N-S attraction). Since the pole strength and the distance are the same in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch.**

Here's why:

* **Simple Sentence:** A simple sentence has one independent clause. An independent clause has a subject and a verb and expresses a complete thought. 

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch.**  This sentence has one independent clause: ""The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch."" It has a subject (""package"") and a verb (""includes"").

* **(1) Unless the weather forecast is wrong, you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow.** This sentence has two clauses: ""Unless the weather forecast is wrong"" and ""you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow.""  The first clause is dependent (it can't stand alone) because it starts with a subordinating conjunction (""unless"").

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are caused by heating.**

Here's why:

* **Baking an apple pie:**  The heat from the oven causes the ingredients to cook and change in texture and flavor. 
* **Cooking an egg:** The heat from the stove or pan causes the proteins in the egg to denature and solidify, transforming the liquid egg into a solid. 

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:** This is the opposite of what happens. Both baking and cooking involve applying heat.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:** While some physical changes occur (like the change in shape of the apple pie crust), the primary changes are chemical. The ingredients undergo chemical reactions due to the heat, altering their composition.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Cassie.
 Hint: Cassie is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Cassie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Cassie with a force of 1,200N."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Cassie.**

Here's why:

* **Forces are balanced:**  Even though gravity is pulling Cassie down (600N) and the seat is pushing her up (1200N), the forces are equal and opposite. 
* **Net force:**  The net force is the overall force acting on an object. Since the forces are balanced, the net force is zero.
* **Cassie's motion:** Because the net force is zero, Cassie will not accelerate. She will continue moving at a constant speed (possibly even at rest if the roller coaster is slowing down at this point).

1529	1529	"Question: Based on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age. (1) It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles. (2) It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure. (3) It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.
 Hint: Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive."	"The answer is (3). Here's why:

* The text states that scientists can use fossils to see how many ancient species have gone extinct.
* It then emphasizes that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal, meaning they have survived longer than other species.
* This comparison between extinct beetles and other extinct species is the key to understanding why there are so many beetles today.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0)** The text doesn't mention anything about beetles only appearing after Earth's last ice age.
* **(1)**  The text focuses on beetles' survival, not what eats them.
* **(2)**  While the text mentions beetles' wings, it doesn't discuss comparing ancient and modern wings using fossils. 

Therefore, the correct answer is (3) -  fossils helped scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species. This comparison revealed that beetles are remarkably resilient, leading to their great diversity today.

 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Certain types of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria have long, thin structures called flagella. The flagella on these bacteria can spin. This motion propels the bacteria and allows them to move through their environments.
Flagella are assembled from many different proteins that stick to each other. Parts of the E. coli flagella are made up of a protein called FliG. The FliG protein is encoded by the FliG gene.
Scientists discovered some E. coli cells that had no flagella. These bacteria had a mutation in the FliG gene. Compared to the FliG gene without a mutation, the mutated FliG gene encoded a form of the FliG protein with a different structure.
This different form of the FliG protein could not stick to other flagella proteins.
Figure: an E. coli cell with flagella."	"The answer is **(1) FliG gene . . . FliG protein**.

milk going sour
deep-frying chicken
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Milk going sour:** This is a chemical change. Bacteria in the milk convert lactose (milk sugar) into lactic acid, which gives the milk its sour taste and smell. This is a change in the chemical composition of the milk.
* **Deep-frying chicken:** This is also a chemical change. The high heat causes chemical reactions in the chicken. Proteins denature, fats break down, and the surface of the chicken browns due to the Maillard reaction. These are all changes in the chemical makeup of the chicken.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical composition.  
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling is involved in some physical changes but not in either of these processes.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** While heating is a factor in both, it's the chemical changes that occur due to the heat that are the primary focus.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Mixing sand and gravel:** This is a physical change. You're simply combining two substances without altering their chemical composition. You can still separate the sand and gravel later.
* **Tearing a piece of paper:** This is also a physical change. You're changing the shape and size of the paper, but not its chemical makeup. The paper is still made of the same materials (cellulose, etc.).

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) antithesis**. Here's why:

* **Antithesis** is a figure of speech that creates a contrast by placing two opposing ideas or concepts side-by-side. 
* In the sentence, ""competition"" and ""challenge"" are presented as contrasting ideas. Competition is often perceived as a negative, while a challenge is seen as an opportunity.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases rapidly as the distance between them increases.  Pair 2 has a much smaller distance between the magnets (15.1 mm) compared to Pair 1 (37.2 mm).
* **Other Factors:**  While the shape of the magnets might slightly influence the field distribution, the primary factor driving the difference in force is the distance.

Since the magnets in Pair 2 are much closer together, the magnetic force between them will be significantly stronger.

 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype BB for the body color gene."	"The correct answer is **(0) a gray body**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The fly has the genotype BB, meaning it has two copies of the dominant allele (B) for gray body color.
* **Dominant Allele:** Since the gray body allele (B) is dominant, it will always express itself even when paired with the recessive allele (b). 
* **Phenotype:**  The fly's phenotype, or physical appearance, is determined by its genotype.  Because it has two copies of the dominant allele (B), the fly will have a gray body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ashley dislikes radishes, so she always orders her salad without them. (1) Before Rebecca's birthday party, Juan wrapped her present with delicate silver tissue paper.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Ashley dislikes radishes, so she always orders her salad without them.**

Here's why:

* **Compound Sentence:** A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and,"" ""but,"" ""or,"" ""so,"" ""for,"" ""yet,"" or ""nor"").
* **Independent Clause:** An independent clause is a group of words that can stand alone as a complete sentence.

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) Ashley dislikes radishes, so she always orders her salad without them.**  This sentence has two independent clauses: 
    * ""Ashley dislikes radishes"" 
    * ""she always orders her salad without them"" 
    These clauses are joined by the coordinating conjunction ""so"". 
* **(1) Before Rebecca's birthday party, Juan wrapped her present with delicate silver tissue paper.** This sentence has only one independent clause: ""Juan wrapped her present with delicate silver tissue paper.""  The phrase ""Before Rebecca's birthday party"" is a dependent clause that modifies the main clause.

Therefore, only choice (0) is a compound sentence.

 Hint: N/A"	"The sentence that states a fact is: **(0) Florence Nightingale's parents expected their daughter to get married, but she enrolled in nursing school in 1844 instead.**

Here's why:

* This sentence provides a verifiable historical event: Florence Nightingale did enroll in nursing school in 1844.
* Sentence (1) is an opinion or interpretation. While there might be some evidence to support it, it is not a directly verifiable fact.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force Factors:** The magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Strength of the magnets:** Both pairs have magnets made of the same material, so their strength is assumed to be equal.
    * **Distance between the magnets:** Both pairs have the same distance (3.15 cm) between their magnets.
    * **Orientation of the magnets:** Both pairs have opposite poles facing each other (N-S), which leads to attraction.

Since all these factors are the same for both pairs, the magnetic force will be the same in magnitude.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It has cold winters. It also has many different types of organisms. (1) It has year-round warm temperatures. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.
 Hint: Figure: Daintree rain forest.
The Daintree rain forest is a tropical rain forest ecosystem in northeastern Australia."	"The answer is **(1) It has year-round warm temperatures. It also has soil that is poor in nutrients.**

Here's why:

* **Tropical rainforests** are known for their consistently warm and humid climate. They experience year-round high temperatures, which is a defining characteristic. 
* **Soil in tropical rainforests** is typically poor in nutrients. This is due to the rapid decomposition of organic matter and the heavy rainfall that leaches nutrients from the soil. 

While option (0) mentions the diversity of organisms, which is true of rainforests, it also mentions cold winters, which is not a characteristic of tropical rainforests.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a song (1) the Bible
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) the Bible**.

The phrase ""turn the other cheek"" is an allusion to the teachings of Jesus in the Bible, specifically the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew:

> *""You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not murder’ and ‘Whoever murders shall be liable to judgment.’ But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire. So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Agree with your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest he drag you to court, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. Truly, I say to you, you will never get out of there until you have paid the last penny.""* (Matthew 5:21-26)

This passage suggests that instead of retaliating when wronged, one should choose to forgive and reconcile. This aligns directly with the meaning of ""turning the other cheek"" in the sentence, representing Tyrone's decision to remain calm and not respond to Ruth's insult.

 Choices: (0) ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent (1) false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent**.

Here's why:

* The argument attacks Mr. Carlson's character (""socially awkward"") instead of addressing the merit of his argument about workplace safety. 
* It attempts to discredit his position by suggesting he's unqualified due to a personal trait, rather than focusing on the actual issue.

**Let's break down why the other option is incorrect:**

* **(1) false dichotomy:** This fallacy presents two extreme options, ignoring other possibilities. The text doesn't create a false dichotomy. It simply attacks Mr. Carlson's character.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder watermelon (1) the hotter watermelon
 Hint: Two watermelons are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(0) the colder watermelon**. Here's why:

* **Thermal Energy and Temperature:** Thermal energy is the total energy of the particles within an object.  The higher the temperature of an object, the faster its particles move, and the more thermal energy it has.

* **Colder = Less Thermal Energy:**  Since the colder watermelon has a lower temperature, its particles are moving slower and therefore have less total energy (thermal energy).

 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) The detective must keep working, or he will never solve this case.**

Here's why:

* **Compound Sentences** have two or more independent clauses joined together by a coordinating conjunction (like *and*, *but*, *or*, *so*, *for*, *yet*).

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) Now the doctor will wrap a bandage around the cut.** This is a simple sentence with only one independent clause. 
* **(1) The detective must keep working, or he will never solve this case.** This sentence has two independent clauses:
    * ""The detective must keep working""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Distance:** The closer the magnets, the stronger the force.
    * **Strength of the Magnets:**  This isn't specified, but we are told they are the same material, so we can assume the strength is the same.

* **Analysis:**  Pair 2 has a smaller distance between the magnets (0.75 in) compared to Pair 1 (1.5 in). Since the distance is smaller in Pair 2, the magnetic force will be stronger.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a bag holding 9 pounds of food (1) a bag holding 7 pounds of food
 Hint: A shopper is buying food at the store. He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape."	"The answer is **(0) a bag holding 9 pounds of food**. Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  Force is needed to overcome the weight of an object.  The heavier the object, the more force is required to lift it.
* **Constant Speed:**  The fact that the shopper lifts each bag at the same speed doesn't change the amount of force needed. It means they are applying the *exact* force needed to lift the bag against its weight.

Since the 9-pound bag weighs more than the 7-pound bag, it requires a larger force to lift it at the same speed.

* The argument attempts to discredit Emily Campbell's articles by associating her with her husband's profession. It implies that because her husband is an investment banker, she cannot understand the struggles of blue-collar workers. This is a logical fallacy because her husband's occupation is irrelevant to her understanding of rural, blue-collar workers.

Let's break down why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(1) Circular reasoning:** This fallacy involves using the claim itself as evidence to support it. The text does not do this.

 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) Kristen was upset about the local news network's coverage of the presidential debates, calling it a travesty of reporting that undermined important issues.**

Here's why:

* **Travesty** in its traditional sense refers to a distorted or grossly misrepresented version of something, often in a way that is disrespectful or mocking.

Let's analyze each choice:

* **(0)** This choice uses ""travesty"" to express Kristen's disappointment with the limited coverage, but it doesn't suggest a distorted or misrepresented version of the debates.
* **(1)** This choice uses ""travesty"" to describe the local news network's coverage as a distorted and inaccurate representation of the debates, implying that it undermined the importance of the issues. This is a classic example of ""travesty"" used in its traditional sense.

 Choices: (0) apostrophe (1) euphemism
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) euphemism**. 

Here's why:

* **Euphemism:**  A euphemism is a mild or indirect word or expression substituted for one considered to be too harsh or blunt. In this case, ""downsizing"" is a euphemism for ""laying off employees"" or ""closing stores"".

 Hint: Compare the student text with the source.
Source: Viorica Marian, PhD, and Anthony Shook, ""The Cognitive Benefits of Being Bilingual."" Published in Cerebrum Oct. 2012.
Researchers have shown that the bilingual brain can have better attention and task-switching capacities than the monolingual brain, thanks to its developed ability to inhibit one language while using another.
Student text:
Knowing a second language can aid in multi-tasking due to the bilingual brain's ability to inhibit one language while using another (Marian and Shook)."	"The correct answer is **(3) Yes, because it fails to use quotation marks and fails to cite the source.**

 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Chanel, a cat from this group, has a hairless body. Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body."	"The correct answer is **(1) bb**. Here's why:

* **Phenotype:**  This refers to the physical expression of a trait. Chanel has a hairless body, so that's her phenotype.
* **Genotype:** This refers to the genetic makeup of an individual.  Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body, meaning her genotype is bb.

Since the 'b' allele represents a hairless body, and Chanel has two 'b' alleles, her phenotype is a hairless body.

 Hint: Fish are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify fish:
They have fins, not limbs.
They make eggs with no shells. Observe the animals and read the descriptions."	"The answer is **(0) Thresher sharks**. Here's why:

* **Fins:** Thresher sharks have fins, which are essential for movement in water.
* **Eggs with no shells:** Thresher sharks lay eggs without shells.
* **Live in water:** Thresher sharks live in saltwater environments.

While Amazon milk frogs hatch from eggs without shells, they don't have fins and primarily live in trees as adults.

 Hint: N/A"	"The more formal text message is **(1) Ms. Ellison is already here. She's waiting in the lobby.** 

Here's why:

* **Formal language:**  ""Ms. Ellison"" is a formal address, while ""Ellison"" is more casual. ""She's waiting"" is more formal than ""She's in the lobby.""

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	"The answer is (1) black rockfish. Here's why:

* **Food Webs and Matter Flow:** Food webs show how matter (in the form of food) moves from one organism to another.  The arrows indicate the direction of energy flow.
* **Tracing the Path:**  We need to find an organism that is eaten by something that is eaten by something else, leading eventually to the bat star.

 Hint: Figure: Monongahela National Forest.
The Monongahela National Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in eastern West Virginia."	"The answer is **(1) It has cold, wet winters. It also has soil that is rich in nutrients.**

Here's why:

* **Temperate deciduous forests** are known for their rich soil. The decomposition of leaves and other organic matter over time creates nutrient-rich topsoil.
* **Cold, wet winters** are characteristic of temperate deciduous forests. This type of climate supports the growth of deciduous trees, which lose their leaves in the winter. 

The statement in option (0) is incorrect. Temperate deciduous forests are known for their biodiversity, including a variety of tree species.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(2) a 225-gram glass of apple juice at a temperature of 66°F**. Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of a system related to its temperature.  The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object possesses. 

Since all the glasses of apple juice have the same mass (225 grams), the one with the highest temperature (66°F) will have the most thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Samantha will give up the chance to eat the chicken soup, which would have been tastier than the onion soup. (1) Samantha will save some time. The chicken soup would have taken longer to make than the onion soup.
 Hint: Samantha is deciding whether to make chicken soup or onion soup for dinner. She wants dinner to be as tasty as possible. But she is also hungry and wants to eat soon."	"The correct answer is **(0) Samantha will give up the chance to eat the chicken soup, which would have been tastier than the onion soup.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:** A cost is something that is given up or sacrificed when making a decision. In this case, Samantha's cost is the opportunity to have the tastier chicken soup. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** This is a key concept in economics. It means the value of the next best alternative that is forgone when making a choice.

The other option, (1) Samantha will save some time, is actually a benefit of making onion soup. It's not a cost.

 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) Sophia told Kate that the fleece jacket on the bench looked like hers.**

Here's why:

* **The pronoun ""hers"" is vague.** It could refer to either Sophia's jacket or Kate's jacket.  The sentence doesn't provide enough context to determine the intended meaning.

Let's analyze the other option:

* **(0) The fleece jacket that Sophia saw on the bench looked like Kate's.** This sentence is clear. The pronoun ""Kate's"" refers directly to Kate's jacket.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having horns (1) not having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Zelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) not having horns**. Here's why:

* **Heterozygous:** Zelda's genotype Hh means she has one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h).
* **Dominant allele:** The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant. This means that if a cow has at least one ""H"" allele, it will not have horns. 
* **Recessive allele:** The allele for having horns (h) is recessive.  This means it will only be expressed if the cow has two copies of the ""h"" allele (hh).

Since Zelda has one ""H"" allele, the dominant allele will be expressed, and she will not have horns.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ii (1) mostly plain scales
 Hint: This passage describes the iridescent scales trait in bettas:

In a group of bettas, some individuals have mostly iridescent scales and others have mostly plain scales. In this group, the gene for the iridescent scales trait has two alleles. The allele I is for mostly iridescent scales, and the allele i is for mostly plain scales.
Splash, a betta from this group, has mostly plain scales. Splash has two alleles for mostly plain scales."	"The correct answer is **(0) ii**. Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  Splash has mostly plain scales, indicating he does not have the dominant ""I"" allele for iridescent scales.
* **The passage also states:**  Splash has two alleles for mostly plain scales. This means both alleles are the recessive ""i"" allele.

Therefore, Splash's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is **ii**.

 Hint: Trevor is deciding whether to join the Photography Club or the Theater Club at school. He wants the club he joins to be fun. But he doesn't want it to take up too much time."	"The answer is **(0) Trevor will spend more time in the Photography Club than he would have spent in the Theater Club.**

Here's why:

* **Cost:**  A cost is something that has a negative impact, a drawback, or something that you have to give up.
* **Time:** Time is a valuable resource. If Trevor spends more time in the Photography Club, he's giving up time he could have spent on other activities. 

Let's look at the choices:

* **(0) Trevor will spend more time in the Photography Club than he would have spent in the Theater Club.** This is a cost because it takes away time from other things.
* **(1) Trevor will have more fun in the Photography Club than he would have had in the Theater Club.** This is a benefit, not a cost. 

Trevor is trying to balance having fun with not spending too much time on his club. So, the fact that the Photography Club might take up more of his time is a potential cost.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is **(2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on two main factors:
    * **Distance:** The closer the magnets, the stronger the force.
    * **Strength of the Magnets:**  Magnets with stronger magnetic fields produce a stronger force.

* **Analyzing the Pairs:**
    * **Pair 1:** The magnets are 12.5 mm apart. 
    * **Pair 2:** The magnets are 6.9 mm apart. 

Since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger, even if the magnets themselves have the same strength.

The force of attraction between two magnets is dependent on the strength of the magnetic field they produce and the distance between them. Here is why the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1:

* The magnets in Pair 1 are of a larger size compared to the magnets in Pair 2. This means that the magnetic field produced by each magnet in Pair 1 is stronger. 
* However, the magnets in Pair 1 are also farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. The magnetic force decreases rapidly with distance.

The stronger magnetic field due to the larger size of the magnets in Pair 1 is counteracted by the larger distance between them.  This means the overall force of attraction is smaller in Pair 1."	natural science

The speaker is trying to discredit Marie by associating her with her sister's presumed ""bad"" viewing habits. This is a classic example of guilt by association.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The suitcase is pushing on Scott. (1) The suitcase is pulling on Scott.
 Hint: Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Scott is pulling on a full suitcase."	"The correct answer is **(0) The suitcase is pushing on Scott.**

Here's why:

* **Newton's Third Law:**  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that forces always come in pairs.
* **Scott Pulling on the Suitcase:**  This is the action force.
* **Suitcase Pushing on Scott:**  This is the reaction force.  The suitcase is resisting Scott's pull, pushing back on his hand with an equal force.

Here's why:

* **A simple sentence has one independent clause.** An independent clause contains a subject and a verb and can stand alone as a complete thought. 
* **Sentence (0)** has two independent clauses joined by the conjunction ""and."" This makes it a compound sentence.
* **Sentence (1)** has one independent clause (""Brennan walked through Paris in a daze"") and a dependent clause (""because he was still suffering from jet lag""). The dependent clause explains why Brennan was in a daze, but it cannot stand alone as a complete thought.

Here's why:

* **""Fish out of water""** is an idiom that means someone is uncomfortable or awkward in a situation that is unfamiliar or different from their usual surroundings.

Let's look at the choices:

* **(0) Matt felt out of place.** This accurately reflects the meaning of the idiom, suggesting that Matt was uncomfortable in the unfamiliar environment. 
* **(1) Matt had not visited that location before.** While this is true, it doesn't fully capture the meaning of the idiom. It simply states a fact, not the feeling of discomfort the idiom conveys.

Therefore, option (0) is the best answer as it directly links the idiom to the feeling of being out of place.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Carly used an old broom to clean up the broken glass before throwing the broken glass away. (1) Carly used an old broom to clean up the broken glass before throwing it away.
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) Carly used an old broom to clean up the broken glass before throwing it away.**

Here's why:

* **Pronoun:** The pronoun ""it"" is used.
* **Reference:**  The pronoun ""it"" could refer to either the ""old broom"" or the ""broken glass"". This creates ambiguity. 

**Choice (0)** is correct because the sentence clearly states that the ""broken glass"" is being thrown away. There's no confusion about what ""it"" refers to.

 Choices: (0) Red-headed poison frogs have moist, smooth skin. Female red-headed poison frogs lay their eggs on plants. The eggs have no shells and are protected by their father. When the eggs hatch, the father frog carries the tadpoles to water. (1) Sea otters have very thick fur. Their fur helps keep them warm in cold water. Female sea otters give birth to live offspring in the water.
 Hint: Placental mammals are a group of animals with similar traits. The following traits can be used to identify placental mammals:
They give birth to live offspring.
They have fur or hair. Observe the animals and read the descriptions."	"The correct answer is **(1) Sea otters**. Here's why:

* **Sea otters give birth to live offspring:** This is a key characteristic of placental mammals.
* **Sea otters have very thick fur:** This is another characteristic of placental mammals.

The red-headed poison frog is an amphibian. Amphibians do not give birth to live offspring and they do not have fur or hair.

1951	1951	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
a slice of banana turning brown
a copper statue turning green
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Banana turning brown:** This is due to oxidation.  The enzymes in the banana react with oxygen in the air, changing the chemical composition of the fruit and causing it to brown.
* **Copper statue turning green:** This is called patina. It's a chemical reaction where copper reacts with oxygen and water, forming copper hydroxide and copper carbonate, which gives the statue its green color.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  These changes are not related to cooling.
* **(1) Both are caused by heating:**  While heat can speed up some chemical reactions, these changes are not primarily caused by heating.
* **(3) Both are only physical changes:** Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical composition. These changes involve chemical reactions and therefore are not just physical changes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter cotton ball (1) the colder cotton ball
 Hint: Two cotton balls are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(0) the hotter cotton ball**. Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the total internal energy of a substance due to the motion of its molecules.
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance.

Since the hotter cotton ball has molecules moving faster on average, it has a higher average kinetic energy and therefore more thermal energy overall.

 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) no (1) yes
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) yes**. 

Here's why:

* **Missing a verb:** The sentence lacks a main verb. While ""crashing"" is a verb form, it's a participle and doesn't act as the main verb in this case. 
* **Incomplete thought:** The sentence doesn't convey a complete thought. We know the spacecraft crashed, but we don't know *what* happened as a result or *how* it crashed.

 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Nico, a cat from this group, has a hairy body. Nico has one allele for a hairy body and one allele for a hairless body."	"The answer is **(1) Bb**. Here's why:

* **Nico has a hairy body:** This means he must have at least one dominant ""B"" allele.
* **Nico has one allele for a hairy body and one for a hairless body:**  This means he has one ""B"" allele and one ""b"" allele.

Therefore, Nico's genotype is **Bb**.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a cart holding 82 pounds (1) a cart holding 59 pounds
 Hint: Two donkeys pull carts from the farmhouse to the yard. The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools."	"The answer is **(0) a cart holding 82 pounds**.

Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  Force is needed to overcome the weight of an object.  The heavier the object, the more force is needed to move it.
* **Donkeys' Effort:** Even though the donkeys move the carts at the same speed, they have to exert more force to pull the heavier cart.

Since the cart holding 82 pounds is heavier than the cart holding 59 pounds, it requires a larger force to move.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** The average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample is directly proportional to the temperature of the sample. This means that higher kinetic energy means a higher temperature. 
* **Kinetic Energy and Speed:**  The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2 * mv², where KE is kinetic energy, m is mass, and v is speed.
* **Comparing the Samples:** Sample B has particles with a higher average speed (1,100 m/s) than Sample A (1,000 m/s). Even though the particles in Sample B are heavier, their higher speed results in a greater average kinetic energy.

**Therefore, Sample B has a higher temperature.**

Here's why:

* **Control Group:** A control group in an experiment serves as a baseline for comparison. It's the group that doesn't receive the treatment (the independent variable) being tested. 
* **Independent Variable:** In Ellen's experiment, the independent variable is the spraying of water.
* **Control Group:** The plants that were only soaked in water received the standard treatment Ellen had always used. They were not sprayed with additional water, so they represent the control group.

1996	1996	"Question: Compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample. Which sample has the higher temperature?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (0) sample A.  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance.  Higher kinetic energy means a higher temperature.

* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the equation: KE = (1/2) * m * v², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle

* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * **Sample A:** Particles have a higher average speed (1,100 m/s) and greater mass (32 u).  This means they have higher average kinetic energy.
    * **Sample B:** Particles have a lower average speed (910 m/s) and smaller mass (16 u). This means they have lower average kinetic energy.

**Conclusion:** Since Sample A's particles have a higher average kinetic energy, it has a higher temperature.

A certain muskmelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit taste gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) sweet fruit**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype **ff**, meaning it has two copies of the recessive allele (f).
* **Recessive Allele:**  A recessive allele only expresses its trait when two copies are present.
* **Phenotype:** Since the plant has two copies of the recessive allele (f), it will express the **sweet fruit** phenotype.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a cart holding 54 pounds (1) a cart holding 53 pounds
 Hint: Two donkeys pull carts from the farmhouse to the yard. The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools."	"The answer is **(0) a cart holding 54 pounds**. Here's why:

* **Force and Weight:**  The force needed to move an object is directly related to its weight.  A heavier object requires a larger force to move it.
* **Donkeys' Effort:** Since the donkeys are moving the carts at the same speed, they are applying the same amount of force to each cart.
* **Heavier Cart, Greater Force:**  The cart holding 54 pounds is heavier, so the donkeys must exert a greater force to pull it at the same speed as the lighter cart.

rust forming on a metal gate
burning a piece of wood
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Rusting:** Rust forms when iron reacts with oxygen and water. This is a chemical reaction that creates a new substance (iron oxide), changing the original iron.
* **Burning:**  Burning wood is a combustion reaction. Wood combines with oxygen, releasing heat and light, and forming ash, carbon dioxide, and other products. This is a chemical change that alters the original wood.

**Let's eliminate the other options:**

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  While cooling can slow down some chemical reactions, it's not the primary cause of rusting or burning.
* **(2) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical composition.  Rusting and burning involve changes in chemical makeup.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  While heating is necessary for burning, rusting can occur at room temperature. 

**Therefore, the commonality between rusting and burning is that they are both chemical changes.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample A (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **Kinetic Energy Equation:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle

**Comparing the Samples:**

* **Sample A:** Has a higher average particle speed (630 m/s) than Sample B (430 m/s).  
* **Sample B:** Has a lower mass (28 u) than Sample A (46 u). 

Even though Sample B has a lower mass, its lower speed is a more significant factor in determining kinetic energy. The much higher speed of particles in Sample A leads to a higher average kinetic energy. 

**Therefore, Sample A has a higher temperature because its particles have a higher average kinetic energy.**

2078	2078	"Question: Based on this information, what is Kraken's phenotype for the eye color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ee (1) red eyes
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for red eyes, and the allele e is for black eyes.
Kraken, a koi fish from this group, has red eyes. Kraken has one allele for red eyes and one allele for black eyes."	"The answer is **(1) red eyes**. Here's why:

* **Phenotype:**  A phenotype is the physical expression of a trait. In this case, Kraken's phenotype is his red eyes.
* **Genotype:** Kraken's genotype is Ee, meaning he has one dominant allele for red eyes (E) and one recessive allele for black eyes (e).
* **Dominant Allele:** The dominant allele (E) for red eyes is expressed even when paired with a recessive allele (e). 

Therefore, even though Kraken carries the allele for black eyes, his phenotype is red eyes because the red eye allele is dominant.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; the samples have the same temperature (1) sample B (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1) sample B. Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated as KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass
    * v = velocity (speed)
* **Comparing the Samples:** Sample B has particles with a higher average speed (780 m/s) than Sample A (610 m/s). Since the particles in Sample B are moving faster on average, their kinetic energy is higher, meaning Sample B has a higher temperature.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Cooking a pancake:**  The heat from cooking changes the chemical composition of the pancake batter.  The proteins coagulate, starches gelatinize, and the batter transforms into a solid pancake.
* **An old sandwich rotting in a trashcan:**  Rotting is a decomposition process driven by bacteria and enzymes. These break down the chemical components of the sandwich (like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats) into simpler substances.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither process is primarily caused by cooling. Cooking involves heating, and rotting happens at room temperature or warmer.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:**  Only cooking is directly caused by heating. Rotting is caused by microbial activity.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Hera is a cow from this group. Hera has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."	"The answer is **(1) a black coat**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Hera's genotype is LL, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele (L) for black coat color.
* **Dominant Allele:**  Since the allele for black coat (L) is dominant, even with just one copy of the allele, the cow will have a black coat. 
* **Homozygous:** Hera is homozygous for the coat color gene, meaning she has two identical alleles (LL). This further confirms that she will express the dominant trait. 

Therefore, Hera's phenotype (observable trait) is a black coat.

burning a candle
silver jewelry tarnishing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Burning a candle:** This involves a combustion reaction where the wax (a hydrocarbon) reacts with oxygen in the air. This produces carbon dioxide, water, and heat. The wax is chemically transformed into different substances.
* **Silver jewelry tarnishing:** This happens when silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form silver sulfide, a black compound that gives the tarnished look.  The silver is chemically altered.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While heat is involved in both processes, it's not the primary cause.  Burning a candle requires an external source of heat to initiate the reaction, but the reaction itself releases heat. Silver tarnishing can happen at room temperature.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but don't change its chemical composition. Burning and tarnishing both result in new substances being formed.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling is not a factor in either of these processes.

Cooking an egg is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) chemical change**. Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition.  Examples: melting ice, cutting paper.
* **Chemical Change:** A change where a new substance is formed with different chemical properties. Examples: burning wood, cooking an egg.

When you cook an egg, the heat causes the proteins in the egg to denature and change structure. This creates a new substance (cooked egg) that is different from the raw egg.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Stretching a rubber band:** This is a physical change because you're altering the shape of the rubber band, but not its chemical composition. The rubber molecules are still the same, they're just rearranged. 
* **An iceberg melting slowly:** This is also a physical change. The water in the iceberg changes state from solid (ice) to liquid (water), but the chemical makeup (H2O) remains the same.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are chemical changes:**  This is incorrect because the chemical composition of the substances isn't changing.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:** This is partially true for the iceberg melting, but not for stretching a rubber band.  
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** This is incorrect. Icebergs melt due to heat, and stretching a rubber band doesn't necessarily involve cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kinsley. (1) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kinsley.
 Hint: Kinsley is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kinsley with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kinsley with a force of 1,200N."	"The correct answer is **(0) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kinsley.**

Here's why:

* **Balanced Forces:**  Balanced forces mean the forces acting on an object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. This results in no net force.
* **Kinsley's Situation:**  
    * Gravity pulls Kinsley down with 600N.
    * The seat pushes Kinsley up with 1200N.
* **Net Force:** Since the upward force (1200N) is greater than the downward force (600N), there's a difference of 600N. However, this difference is balanced by the seat pushing up.

**In conclusion:** Even though the forces are unequal in magnitude, they are balanced because they act in opposite directions. This means there is no net force acting on Kinsley.

Mr. McClure's class is so boring! Why are all literature classes so dull?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself (1) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations (2) ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) hasty generalization**. Here's why:

* **The argument:** The speaker concludes that *all* literature classes are dull based on the experience of *one* specific class, Mr. McClure's. 
* **The fallacy:**  A hasty generalization is made when a conclusion is drawn from an insufficient sample size. The speaker is drawing a conclusion about all literature classes from a single experience, which is not representative of all such classes. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Circular reasoning:**  This fallacy occurs when an argument uses the claim itself as evidence. This isn't happening in the text.
* **(2) Ad hominem:** This fallacy attacks the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself. The speaker isn't attacking Mr. McClure, just expressing a negative opinion about the class.

 Hint: This passage describes the leaf type trait in tomato plants:

In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have regular leaves and others have potato leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf type trait has two alleles. The allele L is for regular leaves, and the allele l is for potato leaves.
A certain tomato plant from this group has potato leaves. This plant has two alleles for potato leaves."	"The correct answer is **(1) ll**.

Here's why:

* **The plant has potato leaves:** This means the plant expresses the recessive ""l"" allele.
* **The plant has two alleles for potato leaves:**  Since the plant has potato leaves, and the ""l"" allele is recessive, both alleles must be ""l"" to express the potato leaf trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample A
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is **(2) sample A**.

Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its speed. 
* **Average Kinetic Energy:** The average kinetic energy of a sample of gas is related to its temperature. Higher temperature means higher average kinetic energy.

While Sample B has a lower average speed, Sample A has a much higher mass per particle. The higher mass of the particles in Sample A outweighs the lower average speed, resulting in a higher average kinetic energy and therefore a higher temperature.

 Choices: (0) Latrell is successful at all that he does. (1) Latrell is lazy and uninformed.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Latrell is successful at all that he does.**

Here's why:

* **The Midas Touch:** This allusion refers to King Midas from Greek mythology, who was given the power to turn everything he touched into gold. This ability, while initially appealing, became a curse as it turned even food and loved ones into gold. 

* **The Text's Meaning:** The text uses the Midas touch metaphor to suggest that Latrell is exceptionally successful, achieving great things (a thriving business and a respected charity) seemingly effortlessly.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Edgar was very tired and sore.**

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole** is an exaggeration used for emphasis.
* Edgar's statement ""he could no longer move a single muscle"" is clearly an exaggeration. It's unlikely he was completely paralyzed after a marathon. 
* This hyperbole emphasizes just how tired and sore he was after the race.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:**  The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity.  
* **Equal Speeds:** The diagrams show both samples have the same average particle speed (490 m/s).
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. 

Since both samples have the same average particle speed and the same number of particles, their average kinetic energies are the same, and therefore their temperatures are also the same.

    * **Distance between the poles:** The distance between the poles is 2.85 cm in both pairs. 
    * **Orientation of the poles:** Both pairs have opposite poles facing each other (N-S).

Since all these factors are the same in both pairs, the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair will be equal.

She could borrow the book for free, but she would have to return it in a few weeks."	"The correct answer is **(1) Christine will give up the chance to keep the book as long as she wants.**

Here's why:

* **Cost** refers to something that is given up or sacrificed in order to obtain something else. 
* By borrowing the book, Christine gets the benefit of reading it for free. However, the cost is that she has to return it after a certain period, meaning she won't be able to keep it permanently.

roasting a marshmallow over a campfire
a copper statue turning green
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Roasting a marshmallow:** The heat from the campfire causes chemical reactions within the marshmallow. The sugars caramelize, the water evaporates, and the marshmallow changes color and texture. This is a permanent change that alters the marshmallow's composition.
* **Copper statue turning green:**  This is called oxidation. The copper reacts with oxygen and other elements in the air to form a green layer called patina. This is a chemical reaction that creates a new substance on the surface of the statue.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While heat is involved in both cases, it's not the sole cause. The chemical reactions themselves are the primary reason for the changes.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  Cooling is not a factor in either process.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (0). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its temperature. 
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:**  Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where 'm' is mass and 'v' is velocity (speed).
* **Comparing the Samples:** Both samples have particles with the same mass (34 u). Sample A has a higher average particle speed (950 m/s) than Sample B (790 m/s). Since the mass is the same, the higher speed in Sample A means its particles have higher kinetic energy.

**Therefore, Sample A has the higher average kinetic energy and thus the higher temperature.**

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(3) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Acid rain weathering a marble statue:** Acid rain (which is acidic due to dissolved pollutants) reacts chemically with the calcium carbonate in marble. This reaction breaks down the marble, changing its composition.
* **Baking a loaf of bread:** The heat from baking causes chemical reactions within the dough. The starch in the flour gelatinizes, the gluten proteins develop, and yeast ferments sugars, producing carbon dioxide that makes the bread rise. These are all chemical changes.

**Why the other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are only physical changes:**  Both processes involve changes in the chemical makeup of the substances involved.
* **(1) Both are caused by cooling:**  While cooling is involved in some baking processes, the primary driver of change is heating. Acid rain weathering is not primarily caused by cooling.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:**  While heating is involved in baking, acid rain weathering is caused by a chemical reaction with acid.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Her comfortable clothing and her warm coat. (1) The city manager will run the meeting she will explain the budget.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Her comfortable clothing and her warm coat.**

Here's why:

* **Sentence fragments** lack a subject and a verb that work together to express a complete thought. 
* **(0)**  This phrase lists items but doesn't have a verb to tell us what's happening with the clothing and coat. 
* **(1)** This is two sentences joined incorrectly.  The first part (""The city manager will run the meeting"") has a subject (city manager) and a verb (will run), and the second part (""she will explain the budget"") also has a subject (she) and a verb (will explain). They are separated by a comma, but need a conjunction like ""and"" to be grammatically correct.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force and Distance:**  The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. 
* **Comparing the Pairs:** Pair 1 has a distance of 2 cm, while Pair 2 has a distance of 3 cm.  Since Pair 2 has a greater distance, the magnetic force will be weaker.

 Hint: From Charlotte Perkins Gilman, ""A Conservative"" and from Florence Kiper Frank, ""The Movies"""	"The poem that uses alliteration is **(1) So I gazed on this unhappy thing**. 

Here's why:

* **Alliteration** is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words.  
* In choice (1), the phrase ""**s**o I **g**azed on this **u**nhappy **t**hing"" uses the repetition of the ""s"" and ""g"" sounds, creating alliteration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Epiphytic orchids are flowering plants that can grow in tropical forests. An orchid can grow on tree branches in the canopy, or upper layer of the forest.
In the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight than it would in the shadowy lower parts of the forest. The additional sunlight allows the orchid to perform more photosynthesis. There is also more wind in the canopy, which helps the orchid spread its seeds to other branches.
The orchid does not damage the tree it grows on, but it also does not provide resources to the tree.
Figure: epiphytic orchids growing on trees in a tropical forest."	"The answer is (2) commensal. Here's why:

* **Commensalism** is a relationship where one organism benefits, and the other is neither harmed nor helped. In this case, the orchid benefits from the tree by gaining access to sunlight and wind, while the tree is unaffected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Parasitic:** A parasite benefits at the expense of the host, harming it. The orchid doesn't harm the tree.
* **Mutualistic:** Both organisms benefit in a mutualistic relationship. While the orchid benefits, the tree doesn't gain anything.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer: (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature.

Explanation:
Kinetic energy is directly proportional to temperature. The formula for kinetic energy is KE = 1/2 * mv^2. The speed of each particle is the same for both samples, and the number of particles is also the same. So the only difference in kinetic energy is the mass. 

The mass of the particles in Sample B is greater than the mass of the particles in Sample A. However, since the number of particles is the same for both samples, the average kinetic energy of the particles will be the same for both samples. This means that the temperature will be the same for both samples."	natural science

* **Analysis:**
    * Both pairs have the same distance (4.85 cm) between their magnets.
    * The magnets are all made of the same material, so their strengths are equal.
    * The orientation of the magnets in both pairs is also the same (opposite poles facing each other).

* **Conclusion:** Since all the factors affecting the magnetic force are the same in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.

picking up a paper clip with a magnet
water evaporating from a lake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Picking up a paper clip with a magnet:** This is a physical change because it involves a change in the position or arrangement of the paper clip. The paper clip itself remains chemically the same. 
* **Water evaporating from a lake:** This is also a physical change. Water changes from a liquid state to a gaseous state (water vapor).  The chemical composition of the water (H₂O) remains unchanged. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(1) Both are caused by heating:** While heating can cause evaporation, picking up a paper clip with a magnet isn't related to heat.
* **(2) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different chemical compositions. Neither process changes the chemical makeup of the substances involved.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** Cooling is not the primary factor in either of these processes.

**In summary, both picking up a paper clip with a magnet and water evaporating from a lake are physical changes because they don't involve a change in the chemical composition of the substances involved.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample B (1) sample A (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (2).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly related to its mass and the square of its velocity. 
* **Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a system.
* **Equal Speeds:** The diagrams show that both samples have the same average particle speed (1,600 m/s).
* **Equal Temperatures:** Since both samples have the same average particle speed, and we're not given any information about different masses, we can assume the particles have the same kinetic energy. Therefore, the samples have the same temperature.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a friend who weighs 21 pounds (1) a friend who weighs 23 pounds
 Hint: Chase gives two friends a ride in his wagon. One friend sits in the wagon at a time."	"The answer is **(1) a friend who weighs 23 pounds**. 

Here's why:

* **Force and Mass:** The force needed to move something (like a wagon) is directly related to its mass.  The heavier the object, the more force you need to make it move at a certain speed.
* **Heavier Friend = More Force:**  The friend who weighs 23 pounds is heavier than the friend who weighs 21 pounds.  Therefore, the wagon with the heavier friend in it will have a greater mass, requiring Chase to exert more force to move it at the same speed.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition.
* **Chemical Change:** A change where a new substance is formed with different chemical properties.

Let's analyze each scenario:

* **Breaking a plate:**  The plate changes shape, but it's still made of the same material (ceramic). This is a physical change.
* **Water evaporating from a lake:** Water changes state from liquid to gas (water vapor).  The chemical composition of water (H₂O) remains the same. This is a physical change. 

**The other options are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:** While heat can cause evaporation, breaking a plate isn't typically caused by heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (0) sample A. Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:** Temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. The higher the kinetic energy, the higher the temperature.
* **Kinetic Energy Formula:** Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = velocity (speed) of the particle
* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * **Sample A:** Particles have a higher average speed (1,600 m/s) than Sample B (1,400 m/s). Even though Sample A particles are slightly heavier, the higher speed outweighs the difference in mass.
    * **Sample B:** Particles have a lower average speed. 

Since Sample A particles have a higher average speed, they have higher average kinetic energy, and therefore a higher temperature.

 Hint: N/A"	"The more formal sentence is **(1) Lucy Buckley is an excellent reporter, so it came as no surprise when her work was nominated for an award.**

Here's why:

* **""Excellent"" is more formal than ""ace.""**  ""Ace"" is a more casual and informal term.
* **""It came as no surprise"" is a more formal construction than ""it was not surprising.""** While both convey the same meaning, the former is more polished and less conversational.

 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Dust settling out of the air:** This is a physical change because the dust particles are simply changing position. The dust itself remains the same, just in a different location. 
* **Pouring milk on oatmeal:** This is a physical change as well. The milk and oatmeal are simply being combined, not chemically reacting to form something new. The substances remain the same, just mixed together.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by heating:**  Neither of these changes is directly caused by heating. 
* **(2) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither of these changes is directly caused by cooling.
* **(3) Both are chemical changes:** Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances with different properties. Neither dust settling nor pouring milk on oatmeal creates new substances.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The wheelchair is pushing on Isaac. (1) The wheelchair is pulling on Isaac.
 Hint: Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Isaac is pushing on his friend's wheelchair."	"The correct answer is **(0) The wheelchair is pushing on Isaac.**

Here's why:

* **Newton's Third Law:** This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  This means that forces always come in pairs.
* **Isaac Pushing the Wheelchair:**  This is the action force.

a piece of apple turning brown
burning a candle
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Apple turning brown:** This is oxidation. The apple's surface reacts with oxygen in the air, changing its chemical composition and causing the brown color.
* **Burning a candle:** This is combustion. The wax reacts with oxygen, producing carbon dioxide, water, and heat. The candle's chemical composition changes dramatically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are caused by cooling:**  Neither change is directly caused by cooling.
* **(1) Both are only physical changes:**  Physical changes alter the form or appearance of a substance but not its chemical makeup. Both of these changes involve a change in the chemical makeup of the substances involved.
* **(3) Both are caused by heating:**  While burning a candle involves heat, the apple turning brown is not directly caused by heat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mutualistic (1) parasitic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Pseudoscorpions are small arachnids that often crawl onto the backs of large beetles, such as harlequin beetles.
When a beetle with a pseudoscorpion on its back flies away, the pseudoscorpion rides along. This ride helps the pseudoscorpion disperse, or move to a new location, much faster and farther than it could on its own.
When the pseudoscorpion is carried along, it does not harm the beetle, but it does not help the beetle, either.
Figure: a pseudoscorpion on the back of a harlequin beetle."	"The answer is **(2) commensal**. Here's why:

* **Commensalism** is a relationship where one organism benefits and the other is neither harmed nor helped. In this case, the pseudoscorpion benefits by being transported, while the beetle is unaffected.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **Mutualism** involves both organisms benefiting. The beetle isn't receiving any benefit from the pseudoscorpion.
* **Parasitism** involves one organism benefiting at the expense of the other. The pseudoscorpion isn't harming the beetle.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Fgfr1a1 protein . . . fgfr1a1 gene (1) fgfr1a1 gene . . . Fgfr1a1 protein
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Common carp are a type of fish that have scales on their bodies. The pattern of scales on a common carp is established while the fish is developing inside its egg. During this time, a protein called Fgfr1a1 sends signals to the fish's body that direct the shape and spacing of the fish's scales. The signals from the Fgfr1a1 protein result in common carp with small, evenly spaced scales.
The Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene.
A certain carp had large, patchy scales because of a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene. Compared to the fgfr1a1 gene without a mutation, the mutated fgfr1a1 gene encoded a form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure.

 Choices: (0) The gas pedal is pulling on Stacy's foot. (1) The gas pedal is pushing on Stacy's foot.
 Hint: Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
Stacy's foot is pushing on her car's gas pedal."	"The correct answer is **(1) The gas pedal is pushing on Stacy's foot.**

Here's why:

* **Newton's Third Law:**  This law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
* **Stacy's Action:** Stacy's foot is applying a force *on* the gas pedal (the action).
* **The Reaction:**  The gas pedal, in response, applies an equal and opposite force *on* Stacy's foot. This is the reaction.

Let's break down why the other choice is incorrect:

* **(0) The gas pedal is pulling on Stacy's foot.**  This doesn't make sense physically. Gas pedals are designed to be pushed, not pulled.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.**

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnets, the distance between them, and the orientation of their poles.  In this case, the magnets in Pair 1 are further apart than the magnets in Pair 2, and the magnetic force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnets. This means that the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be stronger than the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1."	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mutualistic (1) commensal (2) parasitic
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Acacia ants spend most of their lives on bullhorn acacia trees. Up to 30,000 ants can live together in a colony on one acacia tree!
The ants eat nectar produced by the tree and build nests inside hollowed-out thorns on the tree's branches. The ants also attack insects and other animals that try to eat the tree's leaves. Sometimes the ants leave the tree and destroy nearby plants. This creates open space around the tree. The open space makes it easier for the acacia tree to get resources such as sunlight and water.
Figure: acacia ants feeding on nectar of a bullhorn acacia tree."	"The answer is **(0) mutualistic**. Here's why:

* **Mutualistic** relationships benefit both organisms involved.
* **Commensal** relationships benefit one organism without harming the other.
* **Parasitic** relationships benefit one organism at the expense of the other.

In this case, the acacia ants get food (nectar) and shelter (hollow thorns) from the tree.  In return, the ants protect the tree from herbivores and clear out competing plants, giving the tree more access to sunlight and water. Both organisms benefit, making this a mutualistic relationship.

The idiom ""fish out of water"" means to be uncomfortable or awkward in a situation that you are not used to.  It implies a feeling of not belonging or being out of your element. 

While the text states Leo was in an unfamiliar environment, the idiom specifically focuses on how he *felt* about it, not just the fact of being in a new place.

2599	2599	"Question: Assume all other forces on Linda are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Linda?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Linda. (1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Linda.
 Hint: Linda is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Linda with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Linda with a force of 1,200N."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Linda.**

Here's why:

* **Net Force:** The net force is the overall force acting on an object. It's calculated by considering the direction and magnitude of all forces. 
* **Balanced Forces:** When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out.  This means the net force is zero.
* **Linda's Situation:**  
    * Gravity is pulling Linda down (600N).
    * The seat of the cart is pushing Linda up (1200N).
    * The upward force from the seat is greater than the downward force of gravity. However, since they are acting in opposite directions, they cancel each other out, resulting in a net force of zero.

**Therefore, even though there are forces acting on Linda, they are balanced, and she experiences no net force.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) CmACO1 gene . . . CmACO1 protein (1) CmACO1 protein . . . CmACO1 gene
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

In plants such as the European cantaloupe, fruit ripening is affected by a substance called ethylene (ETH-uh-leen). Ethylene is made inside a plant's cells with the help of a protein called CmACO1. The CmACO1 protein is encoded by the CmACO1 gene.
A certain European cantaloupe plant had a mutation in its CmACO1 gene. Compared to the CmACO1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CmACO1 gene encoded a form of the CmACO1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the CmACO1 protein could make only a small amount of ethylene. The fruits of this plant took longer to ripen than fruits from plants containing more ethylene. Farmers found this mutation useful because the fruit stayed good for a longer period of time after harvest.
Figure: a European cantaloupe."	"The answer is **(0) CmACO1 gene . . . CmACO1 protein**. 

The passage states that the mutation in the CmACO1 gene affected the structure and function of the CmACO1 protein. This is because a gene encodes for a protein, meaning that the gene's sequence of DNA determines the amino acid sequence of the protein. A mutation in the gene changes the DNA sequence, which can lead to a change in the protein's amino acid sequence, structure, and function.

The Western Australian pitcher plant is a carnivorous plant native to southwestern Australia. The pitcher is a perennial herb. It is approximately eight inches high. Growing in swampy or sandy soils, it obtains needed nutrients from insects and other small prey. The pitcher plant has carnivorous leaves. The leaves act as traps, or pitchers. The pitchers produce enzymes for digesting prey. Prized among collectors, the plant is considered a vulnerable species.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) by combining sentences (1) by varying how sentences begin (2) by using shorter sentences
 Hint: N/A"	"The best way to improve sentence fluency in this excerpt is **(1) by varying how sentences begin**. 

Here's why:

* **Repetitive Structure:** The current sentences often start with the subject (""The pitcher plant"", ""It"", ""Growing"", ""The pitcher plant"", etc.). This creates a monotonous rhythm. 
* **Sentence Length:** While not overly long, the sentences are all relatively similar in length, contributing to the lack of variation.

By using a variety of sentence structures, such as starting with prepositional phrases, adverbs, or even dependent clauses, the writer can create a more engaging and fluid reading experience. 

For example, here's a revised version of the excerpt incorporating sentence structure variation:

* **Native to southwestern Australia, the Western Australian pitcher plant is a carnivorous, perennial herb.**  (Starts with a prepositional phrase)
* **Growing to approximately eight inches high, it thrives in swampy or sandy soils.** (Starts with a participial phrase) 
* **This unique plant obtains its needed nutrients from insects and other small prey, which it traps within its pitcher-shaped leaves.** (Combines sentences and uses a relative clause)
* **These leaves act as traps, producing enzymes that digest the prey.** (Starts with a noun phrase)
* **Prized by collectors, the Western Australian pitcher plant is considered a vulnerable species.** (Starts with a participial phrase)

 Choices: (0) It has soil that is poor in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees. (1) It has soil that is rich in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees.
 Hint: Figure: Białowieża Forest.
The Białowieża Forest is a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem in Poland and Belarus."	"The answer is **(1) It has soil that is rich in nutrients. It also has only a few types of trees.**

Here's why:

* **Rich Soil:** Temperate deciduous forests are known for having rich soil. The decaying leaves and organic matter contribute to the nutrient content.
* **Few Tree Types:** Białowieża Forest, being a primeval forest, is characterized by having a diverse ecosystem, but its tree composition is dominated by a few species like oak, hornbeam, and pine.  This doesn't necessarily indicate a lack of biodiversity; it's a reflection of the natural succession and dominance of certain species.

"The answer is **(1) Scarlett will give up the chance to eat the onion soup, which would have been tastier than the vegetable soup.**

Here's why:

* **Cost vs. Benefit:**  A cost in economics represents something you give up when making a choice.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** In this case, the cost of making vegetable soup is giving up the opportunity to enjoy the tastier onion soup.
* **Time as a Benefit:**  While saving time is a benefit, it's not directly the *cost* of choosing vegetable soup.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 3:1
 Hint: This passage describes the coat pattern trait in cheetahs:
A cheetah with a spotted coat has many small black spots on its body. A cheetah with a king coat has large black splotches on its body and stripes on its back. King cheetahs are rarely seen in the wild. They were once thought to be a different species.
In a group of cheetahs, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a king coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a king coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a spotted coat (A).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cheetahs."	"The answer is **(4) 3:1**. Here's why:

* **Understanding the Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows a cross between two cheetahs with the genotype ""AA"" (spotted coat).  Both parents contribute an ""A"" allele to their offspring.
* **Genotypes of Offspring:**  All the offspring in this cross will have the genotype ""AA"".
* **Phenotypes of Offspring:** Since the ""A"" allele is dominant, all offspring will have a spotted coat. 

**Therefore, the ratio of king coat to spotted coat offspring is 0:4, which simplifies to 0:1.**  However, the provided answer choices don't include this exact ratio. The closest option is **(4) 3:1**, which represents the expected ratio if one parent had the genotype ""Aa"" (heterozygous) and the other parent had ""AA"" (homozygous dominant).

—Keane, ""Somewhere Only We Know""
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The singer is in a strange and frightening place. (1) The singer has walked the path many times before.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) The singer has walked the path many times before.**

Here's why:

* **""Knowing something like the back of your hand""** is an idiom that means you are very familiar with something, often through repeated experience.

Conscience is a man's compass.
—Vincent van Gogh
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Your conscience shows you where you're headed. (1) Your conscience guides you to act the right way.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Your conscience guides you to act the right way.**

Here's why:

* **Compass Metaphor:** A compass is a tool that helps navigate by pointing towards true north. This suggests that conscience, like a compass, provides direction and helps us find our way.
* **Moral Direction:**  The metaphor implies that our conscience guides us towards the ""right"" path, morally speaking. 

**Option (0)** is incorrect because it focuses on where we are going (our destination) rather than the direction we should take. While conscience can influence our choices and impact our destination, the primary function of a compass, and thus the metaphor, is to provide direction.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy and Temperature:**  The average kinetic energy of particles in a substance is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.  This means higher kinetic energy means a higher temperature.

* **Kinetic Energy Formula:**  Kinetic energy (KE) is calculated using the formula KE = 1/2 * mv², where:
    * m = mass of the particle
    * v = speed of the particle

* **Comparing the Samples:**
    * Both samples have the same mass per particle (40 u).
    * Sample B has a higher average particle speed (980 m/s) compared to Sample A (940 m/s). 

* **Conclusion:** Since Sample B has a higher average particle speed and the mass is the same, its particles have a higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, Sample B has the higher temperature.

I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth . . . My parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them.
—J. D. Salinger, The Catcher in the Rye
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) paradox (1) hyperbole
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) hyperbole**. 

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole** is an exaggeration used for emphasis or humor. In the passage, Holden says his parents would have ""two hemorrhages apiece"" if he shared personal information about them. This is a clear exaggeration, as people don't literally have multiple hemorrhages from emotional distress. 
* **Paradox** is a statement that seems contradictory but may contain a deeper truth. This passage does not contain a contradictory statement. 

**Therefore, hyperbole is the figure of speech used in the text.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) neither; the samples have the same temperature (2) sample B
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of an object (KE = 1/2 * mv^2). Since both samples have the same average particle speed, and the mass of each particle is constant within each sample, the average kinetic energy of the particles in each sample is the same. 
* **Temperature:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since the average kinetic energies are equal, the temperatures are also equal.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes."	"The correct answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.** 

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force Factors:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Pole Strength:**  The strength of the north and south poles of the magnets. Since both pairs are made of the same material, we can assume their poles have equal strength.
    * **Distance:** The distance between the poles. Both pairs have the same distance between the poles.
    * **Orientation:** The relative orientation of the poles. Both pairs have opposite poles facing each other.

* **Constant Factors:** Since the pole strength, distance, and orientation are the same in both pairs, the magnetic force between the magnets will be the same in both cases.

 Hint: From Charlotte Brontë, ""Evening Solace"" and from Gordon Bottomley, ""To Iron-Founders and Others"""	"The poem that uses alliteration is **(0) When you destroy a blade of grass**. 

Here's why:

* **Alliteration** is the repetition of consonant sounds at the beginning of words close together. 
* In this poem, we see alliteration in the following lines:
    * ""**b**lade of **g**rass""
    * ""**p**oison **E**ngland""
    * ""**n**o **m**an's **f**oot""
    * ""**w**here **e**vermore **n**o **g**reen **l**ife **s**hoots""

The other poem, (1) ""The human heart has hidden treasures"", does not have any notable alliteration.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) sample A (1) sample B (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature
 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer: (2) neither; the samples have the same temperature.

Explanation: The kinetic energy of a particle is proportional to its temperature. The average kinetic energy of a gas sample is directly proportional to the temperature of the sample. The average kinetic energy of a gas sample is also proportional to the average speed of the particles in the sample.  Since the average particle speeds are the same for both samples, the average kinetic energy of the particles in the samples is also the same, and the samples have the same temperature."	natural science

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) That wool scarf looks soft and warm. (1) The price went up, so Jane will have to save more money.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) The price went up, so Jane will have to save more money.**

Here's why:

* **Compound sentences** are made up of two or more independent clauses joined together by a coordinating conjunction (like ""and"", ""but"", ""or"", ""so"", ""yet"", ""for"", ""nor"").

Let's break down the choices:

* **(0) That wool scarf looks soft and warm.**  This is a simple sentence with one independent clause. ""And"" is used to connect adjectives, not clauses.
* **(1) The price went up, so Jane will have to save more money.** This sentence has two independent clauses: ""The price went up"" and ""Jane will have to save more money"". They are joined by the coordinating conjunction ""so"".

**Therefore, (1) is the compound sentence.**

 Choices: (0) by adding commas (1) by fixing run-on sentences (2) by fixing subject-verb agreement errors
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(2) by fixing run-on sentences**. 

Here's why:

* **Run-on Sentences:** The first sentence (""People around the world have always encountered frogs and toads in various bodies of water. Unfortunately, pollution and disease is killing many of the world's frogs."") is a run-on sentence. It contains two independent clauses (complete thoughts) joined together without proper punctuation or a conjunction.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) by adding commas:** While commas are important for punctuation, they won't fix the fundamental problem of the run-on sentences. 
* **(1) by fixing subject-verb agreement errors:**  There's one subject-verb agreement error in the first sentence (""pollution and disease *is* killing""). However, the main issue is the run-on structure, not just the singular/plural verb agreement.

A certain watermelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the ground spot color gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) a white ground spot**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The plant has the genotype **gg**. This means it has two copies of the recessive allele (g) for ground spot color.
* **Dominance:** The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant. This means that if a plant has at least one G allele, it will have a yellow ground spot.

2827	2827	"Question: Read the following excerpt from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her organization?
Many students, parents, and teachers cringe at the idea of sending kids to school year-round, but it would improve academic performance. Lengthy summer vacations were not established to accommodate farming schedules, as most people assume; they were started so that wealthy families could leave the city in the hot summer months and vacation in the country. Studies have shown that as a result of ""summer slide,"" many students returning to school in the fall have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Year-round school would provide consistency and help students learn more.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) by making a general statement before giving specific examples (1) by presenting facts before discussing opinions (2) by removing text unrelated to the main idea
 Hint: N/A"	"The best way to improve the organization is **(1) by presenting facts before discussing opinions.** 

Here's why:

* **The essay currently starts with an opinion:** ""Many students, parents, and teachers cringe at the idea of sending kids to school year-round..."" This sets a subjective tone.
* **It then moves to a fact:** ""...Lengthy summer vacations were not established to accommodate farming schedules..."" This fact, although interesting, feels out of place after the initial opinion statement.
* **The essay continues with a mix of opinions and facts:** The writer states that studies have shown ""summer slide,"" which is a fact, and then argues that year-round school would be beneficial, which is an opinion.

**To improve the organization, the writer should present the factual evidence first, followed by the argument in favor of year-round school.** This would create a more logical flow and make the essay more persuasive.

Here's a possible revision:

* **Fact:** Lengthy summer vacations were not established to accommodate farming schedules, as most people assume; they were started so that wealthy families could leave the city in the hot summer months and vacation in the country.
* **Fact:** Studies have shown that as a result of ""summer slide,"" many students returning to school in the fall have forgotten what they learned the previous year. 
* **Opinion:** Year-round school would provide consistency and help students learn more. This is why many students, parents, and teachers should reconsider their opposition to year-round school.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(2) a cookie at a temperature of 13°C**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules within an object. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of these particles.
*  The higher the temperature, the faster the particles are moving, and the more thermal energy the object has.

 Hint: Ling is deciding whether to go as a vampire or a superhero to a costume party. She would rather go as a vampire. But she already has a superhero costume."	"The answer is **(0) Ling will give up the chance to wear the costume she is more excited about.**

Here's why:

* **Cost** in this context means a negative consequence or something that is given up.
* Ling prefers the vampire costume, but she already has a superhero costume.
* By choosing the superhero costume, she is giving up the opportunity to wear the costume she likes better. This is a cost because it means she won't get the enjoyment of wearing her preferred costume.

**Choice (1)** is incorrect because it describes a benefit, not a cost. Saving time and money is a positive outcome, not something Ling gives up.

Let's not pick up our baby every time he cries. If we give in now, he'll end up controlling every aspect of our household by the time he can talk!
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (1) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other (2) slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) slippery slope fallacy**. 

Here's why:

* The argument claims that giving in to the baby's cries *once* will inevitably lead to the baby controlling the entire household. This is a false assumption that exaggerates the potential consequences of a single action. 

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) guilt by association:**  This fallacy involves linking someone or something to a negative entity to discredit them. It's not present in the argument.
* **(1) false causation:** While there might be a correlation between responding to a baby's cries and their development, the argument makes a leap to claim that one directly causes the other, which is not necessarily true. 

The slippery slope fallacy is about exaggerating the potential consequences of a small action, and that's exactly what the argument does.

A certain tomato plant from this group has red fruit. This plant has two alleles for red fruit."	"The answer is **(0) red fruit**. 

Here's why:

* **Phenotype** refers to the physical characteristics of an organism, which are a result of its genotype.

* **12 cups** is too small. A standard coffee mug holds about 1 cup, and a sink would hold many times that amount.
* **12 fluid ounces** is even smaller.  This is a little over one cup. 
* **12 gallons** is a reasonable estimate for a typical kitchen sink. A gallon is about 16 cups, so 12 gallons would be over 190 cups!

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (0).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:**  Kinetic energy is directly related to the mass and speed of a particle: KE = 1/2 * mv^2.
* **Equal Speeds:** Both samples have the same average particle speed (1,200 m/s).
* **Equal Temperatures:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles. Since the speeds are the same and the number of particles is the same, the average kinetic energy is the same. This means the temperatures of the two samples are equal.

* **300 cups** is too small. A cup is a very small measurement, and a kiddie pool would hold much more than 300 cups of water.
* **300 fluid ounces** is also too small.  While a fluid ounce is larger than a cup, 300 fluid ounces is still a relatively small amount of liquid.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is **(0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.**

The magnetic force between two magnets depends on:

* **The strength of the magnets:**  Both pairs use magnets made of the same material, so their strength is equal.
* **The distance between the magnets:**  The distance is 4 inches in both pairs.
* **The orientation of the magnets:** The magnets in both pairs are oriented so that a north pole is facing a south pole, which creates an attractive force. 

Since all these factors are the same in both pairs, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same.

Hunter is big-boned, so despite being in middle school, he often shops in the men's department.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Hunter is overweight. (1) Hunter has larger bones than most people.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Hunter is overweight.**

Here's why:

* **""Big-boned""** is a euphemism.  It's a polite way of saying someone is overweight or has a larger frame. 
* The text explicitly states that Hunter shops in the men's department despite being in middle school. This further suggests that he is larger than other children his age.

While it's possible that Hunter has unusually large bones, the phrase ""big-boned"" is commonly used to avoid directly calling someone overweight.

 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b).
Sandy is a guppy from this group. Sandy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) a gray body**. 

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Sandy has the genotype **bb**, meaning she has two recessive alleles for body color.
* **Dominant/Recessive:** The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b).  This means that even if an individual has one copy of the dominant allele (B), they will have a gray body.
* **Sandy's Phenotype:** Since Sandy has only the recessive alleles (bb), she will express the recessive trait, which is a **golden body**. 

The information provided states that the gray body allele (B) is dominant. Therefore, Sandy cannot have a gray body.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. (1) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1. (2) The strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material."	"The answer is (2). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:**  Magnets attract when opposite poles (North and South) are facing each other. They repel when like poles (North and North, or South and South) face each other. 
* **Distance:** The strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between magnets increases.

In both Pair 1 and Pair 2:

* The magnets have the same pole orientation (opposite poles facing each other).
* The distance between the magnets is the same (40 mm).

Since both the pole orientation and distance are the same, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 1 and Pair 2 will be equal.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is (1). Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on:
    * **Strength of the magnets:**  The stronger the magnets, the stronger the force.
    * **Distance between the magnets:** The closer the magnets, the stronger the force.
    * **Orientation of the magnets:** Opposite poles attract, and like poles repel. 

* **Analyzing the Pairs:**
    * **Pair 1:** The magnets are close together, and their opposite poles face each other. This creates a strong attractive force.
    * **Pair 2:**  While the distance between the magnets is the same, the magnets are not oriented optimally for a strong force. The C-shaped magnet's poles are not directly facing the straight magnet's poles. This reduces the strength of the magnetic force.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(2) Both are chemical changes.** Here's why:

* **Cooking an egg:** When you cook an egg, the heat causes the proteins in the egg white and yolk to denature and change their structure. This is a permanent change in the chemical composition of the egg. 
* **Antacid tablet reacting with water:** Antacids contain compounds that neutralize stomach acid. When an antacid tablet dissolves in water, a chemical reaction occurs, producing new substances. This reaction is irreversible.

**Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:**

* **(0) Both are caused by heating.** While heat is involved in cooking an egg, it's not the primary cause of the reaction in an antacid tablet.

 Hint: Francesca is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Francesca with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Francesca with a force of 1,200N."	"The correct answer is **(1) The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Francesca.**

Here's why:

* **Forces are vectors:**  Forces have both magnitude (strength) and direction. 
* **Net Force:**  The net force is the overall force acting on an object. It's calculated by considering the sum of all forces, taking into account their directions.
* **Balanced Forces:** When forces are balanced, they cancel each other out. This means the net force is zero.

In Francesca's case:

* **Gravity:**  600N downwards
* **Seat of the cart:** 1200N upwards

Since the forces are in opposite directions, the net force is 1200N - 600N = 600N upwards. However, the question specifically states that all other forces are balanced. This means that there must be another force of 600N downwards to balance the 600N upwards force from the cart. 

Therefore, the forces on Francesca are balanced, resulting in no net force.

 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:
Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats."	"The correct answer is **(1) 1:3**. 

Here's why:

* **Recessive Trait:** Dumbo ears are a recessive trait, meaning an offspring needs to inherit two copies of the ""e"" allele (ee) to have dumbo ears. 
* **Punnett Square:** The Punnett square shows the possible genotypes of the offspring. Out of the four possible combinations:
    * One combination (ee) results in dumbo ears.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a dwarf body (1) bb
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a normal-sized body, and the allele b is for a dwarf body.
Penny, a rat from this group, has a dwarf body. Penny has two alleles for a dwarf body."	"The correct answer is **(0) a dwarf body**. Here's why:

* **The question asks for Penny's phenotype:** Phenotype refers to the physical characteristics an organism expresses, like body size in this case.
* **We know Penny has a dwarf body:** This is explicitly stated in the information provided.
* **The genotype (bb) is not the phenotype:**  The genotype refers to the specific alleles an organism has (bb in this case). While the genotype determines the phenotype, they are not the same thing.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a 350-gram cup of black tea at a temperature of 195°F (1) a 350-gram cup of black tea at a temperature of 110°F
 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(1) a 350-gram cup of black tea at a temperature of 110°F**.

Here's why:

* **Thermal energy** is the internal energy of an object due to the movement of its atoms and molecules. 
* **Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles within an object. 

The higher the temperature of an object, the faster its particles are moving, and the more thermal energy it has.  Since both cups of tea are the same size and composition, the one with the lower temperature (110°F) will have less thermal energy.

 Hint: Dustin is deciding whether to eat grapes or oatmeal cookies for an afternoon snack. He would like to eat something tasty, but he is also trying to be healthier."	"The correct answer is **(0) Dustin will give up the chance to eat the oatmeal cookies. Dustin thinks oatmeal cookies would have tasted better than grapes will.**

Here's why:

* **Cost** in economics refers to what you give up when you make a choice. 
* Dustin is faced with a choice: grapes or oatmeal cookies.
* If he chooses the grapes, the **cost** is that he can't eat the cookies. 
* The fact that he thinks the cookies would have tasted better reinforces the idea of a cost – he's giving up something he potentially prefers.

**Choice (1)** describes a benefit of eating the grapes, not a cost.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black fur (1) brown fur
 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
Bandit is a Labrador retriever from this group. Bandit has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene."	"The correct answer is **(0) black fur**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Bandit has the genotype FF, meaning he has two copies of the dominant allele (F) for black fur.
* **Dominant Allele:** The allele for black fur (F) is dominant, meaning it will always be expressed if present, even if a recessive allele is also present.
* **Phenotype:**  The phenotype refers to the physical expression of a trait. Since Bandit has two dominant alleles for black fur, his phenotype will be **black fur**.

ice melting in a glass
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Both are only physical changes.** Here's why:

* **Bending a paper clip:** This is a physical change because you're only changing the shape of the paper clip, not its chemical composition. It's still made of the same metal.
* **Ice melting in a glass:** This is also a physical change.  Ice (solid water) is changing to liquid water, but the chemical makeup (H2O) remains the same.

Let's look at why the other choices are incorrect:

* **(0) Both are chemical changes:**  Chemical changes involve the formation of new substances. This doesn't happen in either case.
* **(2) Both are caused by heating:**  While heating can cause ice to melt, bending a paper clip is more likely caused by applying force.
* **(3) Both are caused by cooling:** Cooling doesn't directly cause either of these changes. 

**In summary, both bending a paper clip and ice melting are physical changes because they only alter the form or appearance of the substance, not its chemical composition.**

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures."	"The answer is **(0) a 3-kilogram brick at a temperature of 0°F**. Here's why:

* **Thermal energy is directly related to temperature.** The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object has. 
* **All the bricks have the same mass.**  Mass also plays a role in thermal energy, but since all the bricks are the same size, we can focus solely on the temperature.

Since 0°F is the lowest temperature listed, the brick at 0°F will have the least thermal energy.

 Choices: (0) 365 yards (1) 365 miles (2) 365 feet (3) 365 inches
 Hint: Select the best estimate."	"The answer is **(2) 365 feet**. Here's why:

* **Soccer fields are relatively long:**  While not as long as a football field, they are still significantly longer than 365 inches (which is about 30 feet). 
* **365 miles** is way too long for a soccer field. 
* **365 yards** is a good possibility, but soccer fields are actually a bit shorter than that.

The standard length of a soccer field is 100-110 yards, which translates to roughly 300-330 feet. 365 feet is a reasonable estimate within that range.

2947	2947	"Question: Which of these organisms contains matter that was once part of the persimmon tree?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasol fungus (1) silver maple (2) beaver
 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	"The answer is (2). Here's why:

* **Food Webs and Matter:**  Food webs show how matter (in the form of food) is transferred from one organism to another.
* **Persimmon Tree:** The persimmon tree is a producer, meaning it makes its own food through photosynthesis. 
* **Beaver:** The beaver eats parts of the persimmon tree.  Because the beaver eats the persimmon tree, it will contain matter that was once part of the tree.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Parasol Fungus:**  The parasol fungus doesn't eat the persimmon tree.
* **Silver Maple:** The silver maple is a different tree species and doesn't have a direct relationship with the persimmon tree in this food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) present tense (1) past tense (2) future tense
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) present tense**. 

Here's why:

* **Present tense** describes actions happening now. The sentence ""Jamie finds old clothes in the attic"" implies an ongoing or habitual action. 
* **Past tense** would use ""found"" and describe an action that happened in the past.
* **Future tense** would use ""will find"" and describe an action that will happen in the future.

 Hint: This organism is a Steller's jay. Its scientific name is Cyanocitta stelleri."	"The answer is **(0) Cyanocitta stelleri**. 

Here's why:

* **Species** is the most specific level of classification in biology. Organisms belonging to the same species can reproduce and produce fertile offspring.
* **Scientific names** are unique identifiers for each species, consisting of two parts: the genus and the specific epithet. 
* **Cyanocitta stelleri** is the scientific name of the Steller's jay, making it the only option that represents the same species. 

The other options are incorrect:

* **Sturnus vulgaris** is the European starling.
* **Goura victoria** is the Victoria crowned pigeon.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The first part of the trail is a piece of cake, but the last three miles are physically demanding. (1) The first part of the trail is quite flat, but the last three miles are physically demanding.
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) The first part of the trail is quite flat, but the last three miles are physically demanding.**

Here's why:

* **Formal language avoids slang and informal expressions.**  ""Piece of cake"" is a casual idiom, making sentence (0) less formal. 
* **Formal language uses more precise and descriptive words.**  ""Quite flat"" is a more formal way of expressing the ease of the first part of the trail than ""piece of cake.""

While both sentences convey the same information, sentence (1) uses more formal language and is therefore the more appropriate choice in a formal context.

Peeling a banana is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(0) physical change**. Here's why:

* **Physical Change:** A change in the form or appearance of a substance, but not its chemical composition. Peeling a banana changes its shape but doesn't alter its chemical makeup.
* **Chemical Change:** A change where a new substance is formed with different chemical properties.  

Since peeling a banana only alters its appearance and not its chemical composition, it's a physical change.

(1) The Rockport Daily Mail was forced to issue a retraction after printing a factoid about Rockport's founder. It turned out that the reporter had written the article based on local legend rather than researching the actual history.
 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(1) The Rockport Daily Mail was forced to issue a retraction after printing a factoid about Rockport's founder. It turned out that the reporter had written the article based on local legend rather than researching the actual history.**

Here's why:

* **Factoid's Traditional Meaning:**  The word ""factoid"" was originally coined to describe a piece of information that is presented as a fact but is actually false or misleading. It often implies a fabricated or embellished ""fact"" spread through repetition. 

* **Choice (1) reflects this meaning:**  The retraction issued by the Rockport Daily Mail implies that the ""factoid"" about the founder was inaccurate and likely based on a false or exaggerated story. 

* **Choice (0) is incorrect:** It uses ""factoid"" in a more neutral sense, simply referring to an interesting piece of information. 

**Therefore, choice (1) is the only option that uses ""factoid"" in its traditional, critical sense.**

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Pebbles is a guppy from this group. Pebbles has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene."	"The correct answer is **(1) an unspotted tail**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Pebbles has the genotype **ii**. This means she has two copies of the recessive allele (i).
* **Dominant/Recessive:** The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant. This means that if an individual has at least one 'I' allele, they will have a spotted tail.
* **Pebbles's Phenotype:** Since Pebbles has only the recessive allele (i), she will express the recessive trait, which is an **unspotted tail**.

""It was my good luck to have to study for a test while all my friends went to the water park,"" Cody remarked.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Cody wanted time to catch up on his responsibilities. (1) Cody was upset about staying home.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Cody was upset about staying home.**

Here's why:

* **Verbal irony** occurs when someone says something that is the opposite of what they mean or feel.
* Cody says ""It was my good luck"" to have to study. However, the context clearly indicates he would have preferred to go to the water park with his friends.  The use of ""good luck"" is ironic because it implies he's happy about studying, when he's actually unhappy. 

Therefore, the verbal irony suggests Cody was upset about missing out on the fun at the water park.

 Hint: Zane is deciding whether to watch a comedy or an action movie. He would prefer to watch a comedy. But he also wants to watch a movie with his sister. Zane's sister will only watch an action movie."	"The correct answer is **(1) Zane will give up the chance to watch the movie that he is more excited about.**

Here's why:

* **Cost in economics:** A cost is something you give up when you make a choice.
* **Zane's Choice:** Zane wants to watch a comedy but will choose an action movie to watch with his sister.
* **The Cost:** By choosing the action movie, Zane gives up the opportunity to watch the comedy he prefers. This is the cost of his decision.

Athena is a Bengal tiger from this group. Athena has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene."	"The correct answer is **(0) orange fur**. Here's why:

* **Genotype:** Athena's genotype is FF, meaning she has two copies of the dominant allele (F) for orange fur.
* **Dominant Allele:** Since the allele for orange fur (F) is dominant, it will always express itself if present. 
* **Phenotype:**  The phenotype is the physical expression of the genotype.  Therefore, Athena's phenotype is orange fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Lester was very tired and sore. (1) Lester became paralyzed.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) Lester was very tired and sore.**

Here's why:

* **Hyperbole** is a figure of speech that uses exaggeration for emphasis. 
* Lester clearly wasn't paralyzed after finishing a marathon. He was able to collapse into a chair, indicating he still had some movement. 
* The statement ""he could no longer move a single muscle"" is an exaggeration to emphasize how exhausted he was.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having sickle-cell disease (1) Aa
 Hint: This passage describes the sickle-cell disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have sickle-cell disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the sickle-cell disease trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having sickle-cell disease, and the allele a is for having sickle-cell disease.
Deion, a human from this group, does not have sickle-cell disease. Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease and one allele for having sickle-cell disease."	"The answer is **(1) Aa**. Here's why:

* **Deion does not have sickle-cell disease:** This means he cannot have two copies of the recessive 'a' allele.
* **Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease and one allele for having sickle-cell disease:** This means he must have one 'A' allele and one 'a' allele.

Therefore, his genotype is **Aa**.

 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(0) apostrophe**. Here's why:

* **Apostrophe** is a figure of speech where a speaker directly addresses a person who is absent, dead, or an inanimate object. In this excerpt, the speaker directly addresses a ""stranger"" who is not present and likely cannot hear the poem. 

Let's look at why the other choice is incorrect:

* **Antithesis** is a figure of speech that uses contrasting ideas or words in a balanced structure.  This excerpt doesn't have that structure.

 Hint: Giant pangolins are adapted to defend their bodies against a predator with sharp teeth. They have hard scales covering much of their skin. When frightened, the  can roll into a ball to protect the soft parts of its body.
Figure: giant pangolin."	"The answer is **(0) armadillo lizard**. 

Here's why:

* **Armadillo lizards** have bony plates embedded in their skin, providing them with protection against predators with sharp teeth. This is similar to the scales of a pangolin.
* **European robins** are small birds with delicate feathers. They lack the protective skin features of an armadillo lizard. 

The hint about the giant pangolin further reinforces the idea that animals with hard, protective skin are better adapted to defend themselves against sharp teeth.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats."	"The answer is **(4) 4:0**.

Here's why:

* **Genotype:**  The Punnett square shows that all offspring have the genotype Mm. 
* **Phenotype:** The allele for myotonia congenita (M) is dominant. This means that even with one copy of the M allele, the goat will exhibit myotonia congenita. 
* **Ratio:** Since all offspring inherit at least one M allele, all offspring will have myotonia congenita. This results in a ratio of 4:0 (4 offspring with myotonia congenita to 0 offspring without).

 Hint: N/A"	"The answer is **(0) The odor emanating from the landfill made Shannon so nauseous that she had to roll up the car windows as she drove past.**

Here's why:

* **Nauseous** traditionally means feeling sick to your stomach, like you might vomit. This is the meaning used in choice (0). Shannon is experiencing a physical reaction to the smell.
* **Nauseating** is the word that means causing nausea or disgust. Choice (1) uses the word ""nauseating"" instead of ""nauseous,"" making it grammatically incorrect in this context. 

It's a common mistake to use ""nauseous"" when you actually mean ""nauseating,"" but the traditional meaning of ""nauseous"" is to feel sick, not to cause sickness.

 Choices: (0) false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (2) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) guilt by association**. Here's why:

* **Guilt by association** means someone is judged based on the actions or characteristics of their associates, even if they haven't done anything wrong themselves. 

In the text, Tessa is accused of starting a food fight solely because her friends are often in detention. This assumes that Tessa must be like her friends, even though there's no evidence to directly connect her to the food fight. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **False dichotomy:** This fallacy presents only two options when more exist. The text doesn't present a limited choice.
* **Circular reasoning:** This fallacy uses the claim itself as evidence. The text doesn't do this, as it uses the friends' detentions as evidence, not Tessa's alleged action.

 Hint: s live near rivers and lakes. They eat insects and snails that live on plants floating on the surface of the water.
The feet of the jacana are adapted for walking on large, floating leaves. The jacana uses its feet to spread its weight out over a wide area. This helps the bird walk on the leaves without sinking into the water.
Figure: African jacana."	"The answer is **(1) purple gallinule**. 

The passage states that the jacana's feet are adapted for walking on large, floating leaves, and the picture clearly shows a jacana. The purple gallinule is a type of jacana, so its feet are also adapted for walking on large, floating leaves. 

The ostrich is a large bird that lives on land, so its feet are not adapted for walking on water.

Here's why:

* **Genotype:** The Punnett square shows that the offspring genotypes are: AA, Aa, Aa, and aa.
* **Phenotype:** Since the spotted coat allele (A) is dominant, the offspring with genotypes AA and Aa will have a spotted coat. Only the offspring with genotype aa will have a black coat. 
* **Ratio:** This means there are 3 genotypes that result in a spotted coat and 1 genotype that results in a black coat, giving a ratio of 3:1.

(1) Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Elise adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally hundreds of years old.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional use of ""literally"":** The word ""literally"" means ""in a literal sense"" or ""actually."" It's used to emphasize that something is truly happening or is exactly as described.
* **Choice (1):** The Rialto Bridge is indeed hundreds of years old, so the use of ""literally"" in this sentence is accurate and emphasizes the bridge's age. 
* **Choice (0):** The Rialto Bridge is not a million years old. This use of ""literally"" is incorrect and hyperbolic, meaning it's an exaggeration for emphasis, not a literal statement.

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The force between magnets depends on the strength of the magnets and the distance between their poles.
* **Strength:** Both pairs use magnets made of the same material, so they have the same strength.
* **Distance:** The distance between the poles in both pairs is 33.3 mm. 

Since both pairs have the same magnet strength and the same distance between their poles, the magnetic force between them is equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1,145 milliliters (1) 1,145 liters
 Hint: Select the better estimate."	"The answer is **(1) 1,145 liters**. Here's why:

* **Milliliters (ml)** are a very small unit of measurement, typically used for things like medicine or small containers.
* **Liters (L)** are a much larger unit, commonly used for measuring liquids like water.

A kiddie pool is a relatively large container that would hold a significant amount of water. It would be highly unlikely for a kiddie pool to hold only 1,145 milliliters (which is just over a liter). 

Therefore, 1,145 liters is a much more reasonable estimate for the volume of a kiddie pool.

 Choices: (0) The helicopter has a constant velocity. (1) The helicopter is accelerating.
 Hint: A rescue helicopter is moving directly upward at a constant speed."	"The correct answer is **(0) The helicopter has a constant velocity.**

Here's why:

* **Velocity** is a combination of speed and direction. 
* The helicopter is moving **upward** (direction) at a **constant speed** (speed). 
* Since both speed and direction are unchanging, the velocity is constant.

**Acceleration** occurs when there is a change in velocity.  Since the helicopter's velocity is constant, it's not accelerating.

 Choices: (0) Audrey's little brother looked a little sick after eating mounds of candy and then going on the nauseous rides at the state fair. (1) Audrey's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair.
 Hint: N/A"	"The correct answer is **(1) Audrey's little brother looked a little nauseous after eating mounds of candy and then going on the dizzying rides at the state fair.**

Here's why:

* **Traditional use of ""nauseous"":**  ""Nauseous"" traditionally means feeling sick to your stomach, like you might vomit. 
* **Common misuse of ""nauseous"":**  People often use ""nauseous"" to mean ""causing nausea,"" which is actually the word ""nauseating."" 

In choice (1), the word ""nauseous"" accurately describes the feeling of the little brother after the rides. Choice (0) uses ""nauseous"" to describe the rides themselves, which is incorrect.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in (1) the male's offspring will become adults (2) the male will spend more energy while waving his fins
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time. This behavior is called fanning.
By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch.
Figure: a fifteen-spined stickleback."	"The answer is **(1) the male's offspring will become adults**.

Here's why:

* **Fanning and Egg Survival:** The passage states that fanning helps bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs, leading to more eggs hatching.  
* **Reproductive Success:**  More eggs hatching means more offspring survive.  Survival of offspring is a key component of reproductive success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **(0) the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in:**  Nest building is a separate behavior, not directly related to fanning.
* **(2) the male will spend more energy while waving his fins:** While fanning does require energy, the question asks about reproductive success, not the energy cost.

 Hint: The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles."	"The answer is (2).  Here's why:

* **Kinetic Energy:** The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its velocity.  The formula is KE = 1/2 * mv^2.
* **Average Kinetic Energy:**  The average kinetic energy of a collection of particles is determined by the average speed of those particles. Since both samples have the same average particle speed (620 m/s), their average kinetic energies are equal.
* **Temperature and Kinetic Energy:** Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance. Since the average kinetic energies are the same, the temperatures of the samples are the same.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes."	"The answer is **(1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.**

Here's why:

* **Magnetic Force:** The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets depends on the strength of the magnets and the distance between them.  The stronger the magnets and the closer they are, the greater the force.

* **Pair 1:** The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2 (21.2 mm vs. 13 mm).  

* **Shape and Material:**  The shape of the magnets and the material they are made of affect the distribution of the magnetic field, but since all the magnets are made of the same material, this factor is the same for both pairs.

Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together, the magnetic force between them will be stronger even though the magnets in Pair 2 are stronger.
