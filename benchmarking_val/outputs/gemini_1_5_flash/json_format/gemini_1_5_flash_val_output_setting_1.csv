 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

7	7	"Question: Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": 0,
 ""solution"": ""Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, while Mars's volume is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3. The difference between the exponents of these two numbers is 15 - 11 = 4. This means that Jupiter's volume is 10^4 times bigger than Mars's volume. 10^4 is 10,000. So the statement is true.""

How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Hint: A shopper is buying food at the store. He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape.
 Lecture: A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object.

Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: Read the text.
In the 1970s, architect I. M. Pei took on the difficult assignment of renovating and updating the beautiful Louvre Palace in Paris without overpowering the original building. The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances. It also needed more restrooms and a bigger cafeteria. Pei designed a large central underground entrance and visitor center. He then added a glass pyramid above the entryway. Although Pei's design faced initial criticism, today the pyramid is considered a brilliant success—a landmark that complements the old palace without interfering with it.
 Lecture: Authors use different text structures to organize their ideas in writing. Learning to identify these structures will help you to understand the relationships between ideas in informational texts. You can also use these structures to organize your own writing.
A cause-effect structure presents the causes and the effects of a particular event, trend, or situation. This structure often uses words and phrases such as because, since, as a result, due to, or consequently.
A compare-contrast structure presents similarities (comparisons) and differences (contrasts) between two or more things. This structure often uses words and phrases such as like, similarly, or in the same way (for comparing) or on the other hand, in contrast, or unlike (for contrasting).
A problem-solution structure presents a problem and suggests one or more possible solutions. This structure often uses words such as issue, question, puzzle, propose, and answer.
A sequential structure describes a series of events that happens in a certain order. This structure often uses specific dates and times or words such as first, next, during, finally, and while.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) North America (1) Australia (2) Africa
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Chanel is a cat from this group. Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the Indian Ocean (1) the Arctic Ocean (2) the Pacific Ocean
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two summer squash plants.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff

 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) no (1) yes
 Hint: Perfume has the following properties:
not a pure substance
liquid
human-made
no fixed crystal structure
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) aa (1) not having agouti fur
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.
Jinx, a cat from this group, does not have agouti fur. Jinx has two alleles for not having agouti fur.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mineral (1) rock
 Hint: Gneiss has the following properties:
not a pure substance
not made by organisms
found in nature
made of light and dark mineral grains
no fixed crystal structure
solid
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

a piece of apple turning brown
bleaching clothes
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Graphite is formed in nature. It is a pure substance. (1) A brick is made by humans. It is not a pure substance. (2) Quartz is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

melting glass
cooking an egg
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters.

 Hint: From Matthew Arnold, ""The Forsaken Merman"" and from Alice Ruth Moore, ""New Year's Day""
 Lecture: Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.

The gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth () as the water balloon fell toward Paul.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) increased (1) stayed the same (2) decreased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
Bridgette dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Paul, who was standing below the balcony.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It breaks down food into small pieces. (1) It helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: To stay alive, animal cells must get water and oxygen. Animal cells also produce carbon dioxide, a waste that must be removed. An animal's respiratory and circulatory systems work together to do these jobs.
An animal's respiratory system is made up of organs that work together to bring in oxygen gas from the environment. The respiratory system also removes carbon dioxide gas from the animal's body. Some animals have lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air. Other animals have gills to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with water.
An animal's circulatory system is made up of organs that work together to move blood through its body. The heart pumps blood through blood vessels throughout the body. As blood moves through blood vessels, it delivers oxygen, nutrients from food, and water to cells. Blood also absorbs waste, including carbon dioxide. When the blood is pumped into the lungs or gills, it releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen.

 Choices: (0) yes (1) no
 Hint: Granodiorite has the following properties:
not made by organisms
no fixed crystal structure
solid
not a pure substance
naturally occurring
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
Roxie, a Labrador retriever from this group, has black fur. Roxie has two alleles for black fur.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: Two basketballs are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) All the things in the back of the closet. (1) Jayla is from Springdale now she lives in Dover.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It is usually missing a subject or a verb.
Knows the answer.
This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a subject.
Who knows the answer? She knows the answer.
The bright red car.
This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a verb.
What did the bright red car do? The bright red car stopped.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.

 Hint: This organism is a marbled salamander. Its scientific name is Ambystoma opacum.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

160	160	"Question: Based on this information, what is Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a).
Kumal is a jaguar from this group. Kumal has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

naturally occurring
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

rust forming on a bicycle frame
grilling a hamburger
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

171	171	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
using a large magnet to remove pieces of iron from a junkyard
sewing an apron
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a gas (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Lecture: Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) AA
 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a black coat, and the allele a is for a spotted coat.
Thor, a jaguar from this group, has a black coat. Thor has two alleles for a black coat.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Choices: (0) Wood is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature. (1) Native gold is a solid. It is not made by living things. (2) Baryte is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Choices: (0) 60 gallons (1) 60 cups (2) 60 fluid ounces
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.

milk going sour
roasting a marshmallow over a campfire
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

not a pure substance
no fixed crystal structure
solid
not made by living things
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

 Choices: (0) Alouatta palliata (1) Macropus agilis (2) Lontra canadensis
 Hint: This organism is an agile wallaby. Its scientific name is Macropus agilis.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.

 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

256	256	"Question: Based on this information, what is Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Toriel is a horse from this group. Toriel has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree.
 Lecture: When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship.

 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Strix uralensis (1) Pelecanus rufescens (2) Ardea cinerea
 Hint: This organism is a pink-backed pelican. Its scientific name is Pelecanus rufescens.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

Mixing eggs, oil, and vinegar to make mayonnaise is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

The gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth () as Emmett rode up the hill.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) decreased (1) increased (2) stayed the same
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
Emmett rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 3:1 (2) 0:4 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of Channel catfish, some individuals have a brown body and others have a white body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white body (b) is recessive to the allele for a brown body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two Channel catfish.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Quartz is not made by living things. It is a pure substance. (1) Pyrite is a pure substance. It is formed in nature. (2) Plastic is not a pure substance. It is made in a factory.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Choices: (0) the Indian Ocean (1) the Arctic Ocean (2) the Pacific Ocean
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

The volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ff (1) bumpy fruit
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele F is for bumpy fruit, and the allele f is for smooth fruit.
A certain cucumber plant from this group has bumpy fruit. This plant has one allele for bumpy fruit and one allele for smooth fruit.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

317	317	"Question: Which plant can produce eggs and sperm?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a mature fern (1) a heart-shaped plant
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.
 Lecture: Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.

 Hint: From Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ""Frost at Midnight"" and from Mother Goose, ""The Crooked Sixpence""
 Lecture: Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the flowers (1) the fruit
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.
 Lecture: Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.

325	325	"Question: Based on this information, what is Bianca's genotype for the eye color gene?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) brown eyes (1) EE
 Hint: In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for brown eyes, and the allele e is for red eyes.
Bianca, a guinea pig from this group, has brown eyes. Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) kelp (1) sea otter (2) orca
 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

knitting yarn into a scarf
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Ammonia is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: Most of the ammonia produced every year is used by farmers to help crops grow. The chemical formula for ammonia is NH3.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

Chloromethane is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: Chloromethane is found in chemicals that some farmers use to kill weeds. The chemical formula for chloromethane is CH3Cl.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) no (1) yes
 Hint: Chocolate has the following properties:
solid
made in a chocolate factory
not a pure substance
no fixed crystal structure
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Choices: (0) an urban area (1) a suburban area
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy fleece (1) a woolly fleece
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
Sage is a sheep from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype FF for the fleece type gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Potassium feldspar is a solid. It is not made by living things. (1) Turquoise is formed in nature. It is a solid. (2) Plastic is made in a factory. It is a solid.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 50 centimeters (1) 50 meters
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) repel (1) attract
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.

 Hint: This passage describes a chemical reaction. Read the passage. Then, follow the instructions below.
Ozone is a gas found high up in Earth's atmosphere. In places with severe air pollution, ozone can also be found in the air closer to the ground. This ground-level ozone forms when oxygen in the air combines with carbon monoxide and other chemicals in polluted air. Ground-level ozone can harm humans by damaging their lungs.
 Lecture: A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.

431	431	"Question: Is a watch a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a solid (1) a liquid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the cup of black tea with more thermal energy (1) the cup of black tea with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two 350-gram cups of black tea are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

 ""solution"": ""The cup of black tea with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature. Thermal energy is the energy of moving atoms, and temperature measures the average kinetic energy of those atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Taricha torosa (1) Lissotriton helveticus (2) Ambystoma opacum
 Hint: This organism is a marbled salamander. Its scientific name is Ambystoma opacum.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

Mrs. Shelton is kind, and her heart is gold.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metaphor (1) simile
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

Bert took several incredible panoramic photographs of the sweeping view from the top of Table Mountain.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) complex (1) compound-complex (2) simple (3) compound
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

459	459	"Question: Based on this information, what is Echo's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) ll
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for a black coat, and the allele l is for a red coat.
Echo, a cow from this group, has a red coat. Echo has two alleles for a red coat.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

To find out how much bigger, divide Jupiter's volume by Mars' volume: \n(1.43 x 10^15) / (1.63 x 10^11) = 0.88 x 10^(15-11) = 0.88 x 10^4 = 8800.

Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 39 hours (1) 39 minutes
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller.

 Choices: (0) I didn't like the ending of The Fault in Our Stars, but the book critic thought it was well-written. (1) The book critic thought The Fault in Our Stars was well-written, but I didn't like the ending.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ardea cinerea (1) Hyla cinerea (2) Lonicera japonica
 Hint: This organism is a gray heron. Its scientific name is Ardea cinerea.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

Leah should either stop reading those sappy paranormal romance novels or finally admit that she doesn't believe in empowering women.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct (1) slippery slope fallacy: the false assumption that a small first step will lead to extreme consequences (2) false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.

ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

The Aden Ridge formed at a () boundary.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) convergent (1) divergent (2) transform
 Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture.
The Aden Ridge began to form millions of years ago as the Somalian Plate and the Arabian Plate moved away from each other. The plates are slowly moving apart at a rate of about 2 centimeters per year. On the map, the ridge is shown in the Gulf of Aden, between the countries of Somalia and Yemen.
 Lecture: The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.

 Hint: This passage describes the Thomsen disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have Thomsen disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having Thomsen disease, and the allele m is for not having Thomsen disease.
Kenneth, a human from this group, does not have Thomsen disease. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) decreased (1) stayed the same (2) increased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
On a snowy day, Edna rode her sled down a big hill.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

Covering its eggs with its body increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the leech's eggs will hatch (1) the leech will not eat for up to a week (2) the leech will fight a water snail
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After  reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream. The leech then flattens its body over its eggs to protect them. The leech protects its eggs until they hatch, which takes four to seven days. During this time, the leech does not leave the eggs or eat.
Water snails are predators that eat leech eggs. The snails easily eat eggs that are not covered by an adult leech. But snails cannot easily get to eggs that are covered by a leech.
Figure: a snail leech.
 Lecture: Animals increase their reproductive success when they have offspring that survive to reproduce.
Animals can increase their chances of having offspring by behaving in ways that help them get partners to mate and reproduce with. These partners are called mates. For example, animals may make special sounds, perform specific dances, or show off bright colors to attract mates. Animals may also compete with each other for mates.
Animals can increase the chances that their offspring will survive to reproduce by caring for and protecting them. For example, animals may feed their offspring or guard them from predators. These behaviors increase the chances that the offspring will survive to adulthood, when they can reproduce.
Many behaviors can increase the chances that animals will have offspring that survive to reproduce. But the behaviors cannot guarantee that the animals will have greater reproductive success. Animals that attract or compete for mates won't always successfully mate and reproduce, and offspring that are fed and protected won't always survive to adulthood.

 Hint: This organism is a black-footed cat. Its scientific name is Felis nigripes.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Chalcopyrite has the following properties:
fixed crystal structure
found in nature
metallic luster
pure substance
not made by living things
solid
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.

542	542	"Question: Based on this information, what is Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a reddish-brown coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Astro is a horse from this group. Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

557	557	"Question: Is a juice pop a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a solid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) EE
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for red eyes, and the allele e is for black eyes.
Zora, a koi fish from this group, has red eyes. Zora has two alleles for red eyes.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the rock with more mass (1) the rock with less mass
 Hint: The objects are made of the same type of matter.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Choices: (0) The authors say that Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen accidentally discovered X-rays when experimenting with vacuum tubes. (1) They say that Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen accidentally discovered X-rays when experimenting with vacuum tubes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a pink ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.

 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a mature fern (1) a heart-shaped plant
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.
 Lecture: Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.

water evaporating from a lake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: This organism is a silver gull. Its scientific name is Chroicocephalus novaehollandiae.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter drop of dish soap (1) the colder drop of dish soap
 Hint: Two drops of dish soap are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

603	603	"Question: Based on this information, what is Fifi's genotype for the ear type gene?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) normal ears (1) EE
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele E is for normal ears, and the allele e is for dumbo ears.
Fifi, a rat from this group, has normal ears. Fifi has two alleles for normal ears.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The baby fish in the aquarium are as tiny as specks. (1) The baby fish in the aquarium are tiny specks.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.

Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 23 yards (1) 23 miles
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) repel (1) attract
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.

water evaporating from a lake
ice crystals forming on a window
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

632	632	"Question: Based on this information, what is Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Lady is a horse from this group. Lady has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

Radon is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Radon is a gas that can cause lung cancer if it is breathed in large quantities. The chemical formula for radon is Rn.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the pennies with soapy water (1) the pennies with pure water
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Bernard noticed that he could make a dome of water on a penny if he added drops of water slowly enough. He wondered if adding soap to the water would allow him to fit more or less water on the penny.
Bernard put equal-sized drops of pure water, one at a time, onto a penny. He recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny. Then, he rinsed and dried the penny, and repeated the test using water mixed with hand soap. Bernard repeated these trials on seven additional pennies.
Figure: a dome of water on the surface of a penny.
 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

648	648	"Question: Based on this information, what is Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pale orange cheeks (1) bright orange cheeks
 Hint: In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
Jack is a cockatiel from this group. Jack has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": ""1"",
 ""solution"": ""Jack's genotype is Rr, meaning he has one dominant allele (R) for bright orange cheeks and one recessive allele (r) for pale orange cheeks. Since the dominant allele (R) masks the recessive allele (r), Jack's phenotype will be bright orange cheeks.""

burning a candle
melting glass
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) DD (1) dark brown seeds
 Hint: In a group of bitter melon plants, some individuals have dark brown seeds and others have light brown seeds. In this group, the gene for the seed color trait has two alleles. The allele D is for dark brown seeds, and the allele d is for light brown seeds.
A certain bitter melon plant from this group has dark brown seeds. This plant has two alleles for dark brown seeds.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

cooking an egg
salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Choices: (0) the hotter helium balloon (1) the colder helium balloon
 Hint: Two helium balloons are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) brown eyes
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have red eyes and others have brown eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the eye color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Hint: The objects are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.

719	719	"Question: Based on this information, what is this scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red flowers (1) Ff
 Hint: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for red flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers.
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has red flowers. This plant has one allele for red flowers and one allele for white flowers.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.
 Lecture: A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

 Hint: This organism is an agile wallaby. Its scientific name is Macropus agilis.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ff (1) smooth fruit
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele F is for bumpy fruit, and the allele f is for smooth fruit.
A certain cucumber plant from this group has smooth fruit. This plant has two alleles for smooth fruit.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 3:1 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the Huntington's disease trait in humans:
Huntington's disease is a condition that causes the death of brain cells over time. This loss of cells interferes with brain function and may lead to uncontrolled movements, difficulty thinking, and changes in behavior.
In a group of humans, some individuals have Huntington's disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Huntington's disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive to the allele for having Huntington's disease (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two humans.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) barren-ground caribou (1) bilberry
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.

 Lecture: Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Dasher is a horse from this group. Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a solid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

solid
fixed crystal structure
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) compound-complex (1) compound (2) complex (3) simple
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.
During his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.
A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.

 Choices: (0) Galena is a solid. It is not made by living things. (1) Silk is not a pure substance. It is made by living things. (2) Calcite is a solid. It is a pure substance.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Hint: This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.
 Lecture: A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bottles with lids kept on (1) the bottles with lids taken off
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Steve wanted to freeze soda to make popsicles. He knew that soda contains carbon dioxide gas, which forms bubbles as it escapes from the liquid. He wondered if the popsicles would freeze more quickly if he removed the carbon dioxide.
Steve took the lids off three small bottles of soda. He left the lids off overnight so that carbon dioxide could escape from the bottles. He kept the lids on three other bottles to keep the carbon dioxide in. The next morning, Steve placed all six bottles in the freezer. After two hours, he checked whether soda in any of the bottles had frozen.
Figure: soda with carbon dioxide bubbles.
 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

water boiling on a stove
baking an apple pie
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Choices: (0) Solution A (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution B
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

Boron trifluoride is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: Boron trifluoride is used to make many types of chemicals, such as plastics. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride is BF3.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

Photosynthesis is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a solid (1) a liquid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

840	840	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) fuzzy fruit (1) smooth fruit
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
A certain tomato plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

844	844	"Question: Based on this information, what is Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Kraken is a guppy from this group. Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) false (1) true
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) attract (1) repel
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Hint: Magnets that attract pull together. Magnets that repel push apart.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.

The Japan Trench formed at a () boundary.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) divergent (1) convergent (2) transform
 Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture.
The Japan Trench is a deep-sea trench east of the islands of Japan. The trench formed as the Pacific Plate subducted, or sank, below the Okhotsk Plate. The two plates continue to move toward each other. This movement can cause devastating earthquakes in Japan, such as a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011.
 Lecture: The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-ocean subduction zone, which forms when two plates with oceanic crust move toward each other. One of the plates subducts, or sinks, below the other.
When one of the plates subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes in the ocean called a volcanic island arc.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) spore cases on a heart-shaped plant (1) spore cases on a mature fern
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.
 Lecture: Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having agouti fur (1) having agouti fur
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A).
Salem is a cat from this group. Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) HO2 (1) H3O3 (2) H2O2 (3) H2O
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the pistil (1) the anthers
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.
 Lecture: Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) green fruit (1) yellow fruit
 Hint: In a group of ornamental gourd plants, some individuals have yellow fruit and others have green fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f).
A certain ornamental gourd plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:

appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Golgi (1) chromosomes (2) nucleus (3) vacuole
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 1:3 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) Solution A (2) neither; their concentrations are the same
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

948	948	"Question: Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
The volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pair of scissors (1) water in a glass (2) grape juice (3) air from a hair dryer
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) stayed the same (1) decreased (2) increased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
On a snowy day, Candice rode her sled down a big hill.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

{
 ""answer"": ""1"",
 ""solution"": ""Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3. Saturn's volume is 8.27 x 10^14 km^3. To compare the two volumes, we look at the exponents first. 15 > 14, so Jupiter's volume is larger than Saturn's volume. 10^15 is 10 times larger than 10^14, which means Jupiter's volume is more than ten times as large as Saturn's volume. Therefore, the statement is true.""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a solid (2) a liquid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Hint: This organism is a cocoi heron. Its scientific name is Ardea cocoi.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Native gold is a pure substance. It is formed in nature. (1) A sunflower seed is not a pure substance. It is made by a living thing. (2) Muscovite is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a black body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

Potassium chloride is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: The model below represents potassium chloride. Potassium chloride can be added to food as a substitute for table salt.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound rubidium bromide.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It eats a producer. (1) It makes its own food. (2) It eats a primary consumer.
 Hint: This diagram shows a food chain from a grassland ecosystem in Wyoming.
 Lecture: Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 0:4 (2) 2:2 (3) 3:1 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) South America (1) Australia (2) Antarctica
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) plainfin midshipman (1) phytoplankton (2) kelp bass (3) black rockfish
 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) cyclopropane (C3H6) (1) argon (Ar) (2) phosphine (PH3)
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the metal paper clip with less thermal energy (1) the metal paper clip with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two metal paper clips are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

 Hint: This organism is a western gull. Its scientific name is Larus occidentalis.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a solid (1) a gas (2) a liquid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white spots (1) solid coloring
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Ace is a cow from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

1036	1036	"Question: Based on this information, what is Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) black eyes
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E).
Gilligan is a koi fish from this group. Gilligan has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The neighborhood association wants them to provide more affordable housing. (1) The neighborhood association wants city officials to provide more affordable housing.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the male part (1) the female part
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.
 Lecture: Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.

 Lecture: Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""

dust settling out of the air
melting wax
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: Two meatballs are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having agouti fur (1) aa
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.
Oliver, a cat from this group, does not have agouti fur. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 4:0 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

dust settling out of the air
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Nutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy fleece (1) FF
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for a hairy fleece, and the allele f is for a woolly fleece.
Thistle, a sheep from this group, has a hairy fleece. Thistle has two alleles for a hairy fleece.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

acid rain weathering a marble statue
chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bat bones (1) air inside a raft (2) pair of dice (3) water in a fishbowl
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bobcat (1) black bear (2) black racer (3) gray fox
 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.

1132	1132	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
making paper from wood
rust forming on a metal gate
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

The volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Choices: (0) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good (1) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (2) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

 Choices: (0) crayons (1) slide (2) dish soap (3) coins
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ardea herodias (1) Falco tinnunculus (2) Ardea cinerea
 Hint: This organism is an American kestrel. Its scientific name is Falco sparverius.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.
Jupiter, a leopard from this group, has a black coat. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
Nina dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Ronald, who was standing below the balcony.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

The gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth () as the water balloon fell toward Sandeep.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) increased (1) stayed the same (2) decreased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
Rosa dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Sandeep, who was standing below the balcony.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same

1181	1181	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
a penny tarnishing
firing a clay pot in a hot kiln
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Earth is the largest planet that is made mainly of rock.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12

 Hint: The text below describes how an area's environment changed over time. Read the text. Then answer the question.

Figure 1: sediment deposited by a fast-flowing river.
A fast-flowing river deposited heavy sediment grains along its banks. Light sediment such as mud was carried away by the strong water current.

Figure 2: sediment deposited in a desert.
Over thousands of years, the river dried up, and the area became a desert. In the desert, sediment was deposited by wind.
 Lecture: Material that is carried by wind, water, or ice is called sediment. Sediment may be deposited, or laid down, in places such as deserts and the ocean floor. Different types of sediment are deposited in different environments. For example, sand may be deposited in a desert, and mud may be deposited at the bottom of the ocean.
The environment of an area can change over thousands of years. When the environment changes, the type of sediment that is deposited also changes. Over a long period of time, different layers of sediment can build up in the same area. These layers preserve a record of the environments that existed in that area in the past.
As many layers of sediment build up, they can be pressed together to form layers of sedimentary rock. A series of rock layers is called a rock sequence. You can observe the layers of a rock sequence to learn more about how an area's environment changed over time.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white spots (1) aa
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for solid coloring, and the allele a is for white spots.
Buck, a cow from this group, has white spots. Buck has two alleles for white spots.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners.

Zack swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) simile (1) metaphor
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) South America (1) Asia (2) Africa
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: The model below represents a molecule of chloroform. Chloroform was once used for pain relief. It is no longer used because it can be dangerous to humans.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance.

 Choices: (0) ad hominem: an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself (1) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good (2) hasty generalization: a broad claim based on too few observations
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Hint: In a group of chickens, some individuals have white legs and others have yellow legs. In this group, the gene for the leg color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for white legs, and the allele l is for yellow legs.
Birdie, a chicken from this group, has white legs. Birdie has one allele for white legs and one allele for yellow legs.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce (1) the colder pot of spaghetti sauce
 Hint: Two pots of spaghetti sauce are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Fluorite is a pure substance. It is formed in nature. (1) Wool is not a pure substance. It is a solid. (2) Baryte is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) simple (1) compound-complex (2) compound (3) complex
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.
During his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.
A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.

erosion caused by wind
shaking up salad dressing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 2:2 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cucumber plants.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) N2H3 (1) NH3 (2) N2H4 (3) NH
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above.

1321	1321	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) smooth leaves (1) fuzzy leaves
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype LL for the leaf texture gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the fish tank with more thermal energy (1) the fish tank with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two fish tanks are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

A certain Channel catfish from this group has a white body. This catfish has two alleles for a white body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

1357	1357	"Question: Which tennis ball has more thermal energy?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder tennis ball (1) the hotter tennis ball
 Hint: Two tennis balls are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Hint: This organism is a bald eagle. Its scientific name is Haliaeetus leucocephalus.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Lecture: Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

1384	1384	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Silver bromide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Silver bromide is used on the film that some photographers use in their cameras. The chemical formula for silver bromide is AgBr.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

Zirconium is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: Most of the zirconium produced every year is used in certain types of power plants to keep dangerous fuel from leaking. The chemical formula for zirconium is Zr.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cats.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy (1) the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

Ice melting in a cup is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) physical change (1) chemical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a solid (2) a liquid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.

Located just south of Dover, Tristan's Restaurant offers an eclectic menu in a scenic country setting.
 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) yes (1) no
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

 Lecture: Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) II
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele I is for a spotted tail, and the allele i is for an unspotted tail.
Undyne, a guppy from this group, has a spotted tail. Undyne has two alleles for a spotted tail.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) gray fox (1) persimmon tree (2) beaver (3) silver maple
 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.

 Lecture: Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.

silver jewelry tarnishing
boiling sugar to make caramel
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Wesley has naturally curly hair.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) acquired (1) inherited
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the cherry pie with more thermal energy (1) the cherry pie with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two cherry pies are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

butter melting on a hot day
peeling a banana
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted coat (1) Aa
 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.
Apollo, a leopard from this group, has a spotted coat. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat and one allele for a black coat.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 0:4 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two budgerigar parakeets.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the Arctic Ocean (1) the Pacific Ocean (2) the Indian Ocean
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bb (1) a dwarf body
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a normal-sized body, and the allele b is for a dwarf body.
Algernon, a rat from this group, has a dwarf body. Algernon has two alleles for a dwarf body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

1529	1529	"Question: Based on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age. (1) It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles. (2) It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure. (3) It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.
 Hint: Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.
 Lecture: Informational texts include many facts, examples, and details. Authors don't always directly state how these things connect to each other. So, you may need to make guesses, or inferences, to understand how the ideas from the text fit together. Inferences can help you understand the whole text and draw conclusions about the information.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) FliG protein . . . FliG gene (1) FliG gene . . . FliG protein
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Certain types of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria have long, thin structures called flagella. The flagella on these bacteria can spin. This motion propels the bacteria and allows them to move through their environments.
Flagella are assembled from many different proteins that stick to each other. Parts of the E. coli flagella are made up of a protein called FliG. The FliG protein is encoded by the FliG gene.
Scientists discovered some E. coli cells that had no flagella. These bacteria had a mutation in the FliG gene. Compared to the FliG gene without a mutation, the mutated FliG gene encoded a form of the FliG protein with a different structure.
This different form of the FliG protein could not stick to other flagella proteins.
Figure: an E. coli cell with flagella.
 Lecture: An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.
An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) to the left than to the right (1) to the right than to the left
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a purple ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

milk going sour
deep-frying chicken
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

1573	1573	"Question: Based on this information, what is Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) solid coloring (1) white spots
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Winnee is a cow from this group. Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Hint: Potassium feldspar has the following properties:
fixed crystal structure
solid

not made by living things
pure substance
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

1585	1585	"Question: Which brownie has more thermal energy?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder brownie (1) the hotter brownie
 Hint: Two brownies are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Pelecanus occidentalis (1) Pelecanus philippensis (2) Falco peregrinus
 Hint: This organism is a peregrine falcon. Its scientific name is Falco peregrinus.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Jayla went down the slide face-first, like a penguin.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metaphor (1) simile
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

bending a paper clip
breaking a rock in half
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Carbon monoxide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is produced by volcanic eruptions and wildfires. The chemical formula for carbon monoxide is CO.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

 Lecture: An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.
An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:
speeding up,
slowing down, or
changing direction.

 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

 Choices: (0) BB (1) a hairy body
 Hint: In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Candy, a deer mouse from this group, has a hairy body. Candy has two alleles for a hairy body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

A certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype BB for the body color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) spores (1) an adult moss plant
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a moss.
 Lecture: Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Limestone has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
naturally occurring
not made by living things
forms from ocean sediment
solid
made mostly of calcite
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) repel (1) attract
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) green body feathers (1) blue body feathers
 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
Tiki is a budgerigar parakeet from this group. Tiki has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chromosomes (1) chloroplasts (2) cell membrane (3) vacuole
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Hematite is not made by living things. It is a pure substance. (1) Quartz is formed in nature. It is a pure substance. (2) A skull is not a pure substance. It is made by a living thing.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

1689	1689	"Question: Is ocean water a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a solid (2) a liquid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

Bleaching hair is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chemical change (1) physical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.

A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the glass of grape juice with less thermal energy (1) the glass of grape juice with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two 225-gram glasses of grape juice are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a solid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) to the right than to the left (1) to the left than to the right
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a yellow ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Pyrite is not made by living things. It is formed in nature. (1) Galena is a pure substance. It is not made by living things. (2) A marble is made by humans. It is a solid.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.
Millie, a cat from this group, has agouti fur. Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

1759	1759	"Question: Do ferns produce seeds?
 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) yes (1) no
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.
 Lecture: Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter meatball (1) the colder meatball
 Hint: Two meatballs are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Antarctica (1) South America (2) North America
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) eggs and sperm (1) spores
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of a moss.
 Lecture: Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.

1783	1783	"Question: Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) false (1) true
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": 1,
 ""solution"": ""Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.  Mars' volume is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3.  Since 10^15 is bigger than 10^11, Jupiter's volume is bigger than Mars' volume. To find out how many times larger, divide Jupiter's volume by Mars' volume: 1.43 x 10^15 / 1.63 x 10^11 = 8.78 x 10^3.  8.78 x 10^3 is larger than 10,000. Therefore, Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars. So the answer is true.""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Yes, because it fails to use quotation marks. (1) Yes, because it fails to cite the source. (2) No, it is not plagiarized. (3) Yes, because it fails to use quotation marks and fails to cite the source.
 Hint: Compare the student text with the source.
Source: Viorica Marian, PhD, and Anthony Shook, ""The Cognitive Benefits of Being Bilingual."" Published in Cerebrum Oct. 2012.
Researchers have shown that the bilingual brain can have better attention and task-switching capacities than the monolingual brain, thanks to its developed ability to inhibit one language while using another.
Student text:
Knowing a second language can aid in multi-tasking due to the bilingual brain's ability to inhibit one language while using another (Marian and Shook).
 Lecture: Plagiarism is the act of taking another person's work or ideas and presenting them as your own, either accidentally or on purpose. When you use an outside source in your own writing, you should make sure to cite the source in order to avoid plagiarism. Consider the following source:
Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, ""Searching for Explanations: How the Internet Inflates Estimates of Internal Knowledge."" Copyright 2015 by the American Psychological Association
The results of these experiments suggest that searching the Internet may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge. Searching for explanations on the Internet inflates self-assessed knowledge in unrelated domains.
If you use a direct quotation in your writing, you must use quotation marks around the exact words that were copied from the source, in addition to citing the source.
Researchers have found that relying on the Internet for information may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge.
This sentence is plagiarized because it uses the source's exact words without quotation marks and without properly citing the source.
Researchers have found that relying on the Internet for information ""may cause a systematic failure to recognize the extent to which we rely on outsourced knowledge"" (Fisher, Goddu, and Keil).
If you paraphrase a source, or put a source's ideas into your own words, you must still cite the source. Even if properly cited, a paraphrase that is too similar to the source in wording or sentence structure is still considered plagiarized.
According to Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, searching the Internet can lead to a regular failure to perceive the extent to which we rely on outside knowledge.
This sentence is plagiarized because it is an insufficient paraphrase. Even though it is properly cited, it borrows too much of the source's wording and sentence structure.
According to Fisher, Goddu, and Keil, relying on the Internet to look up information can make it difficult for us to estimate how much of our knowledge comes from internal versus external sources.
There are different rules about how to format citations, such as when to include page numbers for print sources. Check a style guide, such as the Modern Language Association (MLA) Handbook, for a complete list of these rules.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Dolostone has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
naturally occurring
solid
light gray
made mostly of dolomite
not made by organisms
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) reactant (1) product
 Hint: This passage describes a chemical reaction. Read the passage. Then, follow the instructions below.
Hydrogen peroxide, a household disinfectant, breaks down into water and oxygen gas over time. Light speeds up this process, so hydrogen peroxide is typically stored in a dark-colored bottle. The bottle's dark coloring blocks light and makes the hydrogen peroxide last longer.
 Lecture: A chemical change occurs when new substances are formed from existing substances. This process is called a chemical reaction.
In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.
The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairless body (1) bb
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Chanel, a cat from this group, has a hairless body. Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Choices: (0) the cup of black tea with more thermal energy (1) the cup of black tea with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two 250-gram cups of black tea are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

1841	1841	"Question: Based on this information, what is Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having horns (1) not having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Zelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance copper.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. The color of a ball represents a specific chemical element. The atomic symbol for that chemical element is shown in the legend.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ii (1) mostly plain scales
 Hint: This passage describes the iridescent scales trait in bettas:

In a group of bettas, some individuals have mostly iridescent scales and others have mostly plain scales. In this group, the gene for the iridescent scales trait has two alleles. The allele I is for mostly iridescent scales, and the allele i is for mostly plain scales.
Splash, a betta from this group, has mostly plain scales. Splash has two alleles for mostly plain scales.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

A slice of banana turning brown is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chemical change (1) physical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) air inside a soccer ball (1) water droplets (2) robot (3) helium
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) grizzly bear (1) bilberry (2) short-tailed weasel
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having albinism (1) Aa
 Hint: This passage describes the albinism trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have albinism and others do not. In this group, the gene for the albinism trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having albinism, and the allele a is for having albinism.
Faye, a rat from this group, does not have albinism. Faye has one allele for not having albinism and one allele for having albinism.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: Siltstone has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
solid
not made by living things
made up of fine sediment grains
not a pure substance
found in nature
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

It's true that pasteurization kills harmful bacteria in milk. But pasteurization is a process that was invented by humans. Instead, we should drink milk raw, pure, and unchanged. It's better for us.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct (1) appeal to nature: the assumption that natural things are always good (2) circular reasoning: an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 14 feet (1) 14 inches
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.

 Hint: This organism is a bobcat. Its scientific name is Lynx rufus.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

cutting an apple
shaking up salad dressing
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Carly used an old broom to clean up the broken glass before throwing the broken glass away. (1) Carly used an old broom to clean up the broken glass before throwing it away.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:

 Hint: Two cotton balls are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Nico, a cat from this group, has a hairy body. Nico has one allele for a hairy body and one allele for a hairless body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Choices: (0) An antler is not a pure substance. It is formed in nature. (1) Baryte is not made by living things. It is formed in nature. (2) Gypsum is formed in nature. It is a solid.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Beavers build a dam, they use sticks and branches. (1) Our cabin has bunk beds for the kids.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) After Mr. Vance finished performing with Mr. Patton, Mary went up and thanked him. (1) Mary went up and thanked Mr. Vance after he finished performing with Mr. Patton.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2 centimeters (1) 2 kilometers
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

Zinc is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Zinc is a metal that is used to make batteries and musical instruments. The chemical formula for zinc is Zn.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Choices: (0) a cone (1) a seed (2) pollen
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.

1970	1970	"Question: Is gasoline a solid, a liquid, or a gas?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a solid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.

 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Ellen had six air plants on her desk that were not growing. Once a week, she soaked the air plants in water. But she suspected that they needed more water. She wondered if spraying the air plants with water every day in addition to soaking them would help them grow.
Ellen measured the initial weight of all six air plants. Then, for the next month, she continued to soak all of the air plants once a week. She also sprayed three of the plants every day. At the end of the month, Ellen measured the weights of the plants again.

 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straight fur (1) Ff
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for straight fur, and the allele f is for curly fur.
Luce, a cat from this group, has straight fur. Luce has one allele for straight fur and one allele for curly fur.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a gas (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pale orange cheeks (1) rr
 Hint: In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele R is for bright orange cheeks, and the allele r is for pale orange cheeks.
Fawkes, a cockatiel from this group, has pale orange cheeks. Fawkes has two alleles for pale orange cheeks.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) South America (1) Europe (2) Australia
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

a piece of avocado turning brown
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait.

In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Chelmon rostratus (1) Amphiprion frenatus (2) Premnas biaculeatus
 Hint: This organism is a copperband butterflyfish. Its scientific name is Chelmon rostratus.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Organisms that carry out photosynthesis are called photosynthetic organisms. During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Producers don't usually eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are cell parts where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain chlorophyll, which is green. Chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight to power photosynthesis.

rust forming on a metal gate
burning a piece of wood
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it.

2066	2066	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the thorns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having thorns (1) not having thorns
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype rr for the thorns gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chemical change (1) physical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids.
During his trip to Italy, Tony visited the Trevi Fountain, which is in Rome.
A compound-complex sentence is made up of two or more independent clauses and one or more dependent clauses.
After Samantha left work, she stopped at the bank, and then she went to the gym.
Sometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.

 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) yes (1) no
 Hint: A peach pit has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
not a pure substance
solid
made by a peach tree
naturally occurring
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

mixing sand and water
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the hotter plate of spaghetti (1) the colder plate of spaghetti
 Hint: Two plates of spaghetti are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

breaking a ceramic plate
picking up a paper clip with a magnet
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

2127	2127	"Question: Based on this information, what is Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Hera is a cow from this group. Hera has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": ""1"",

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Magnesium is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: Magnesium burns easily in air, so it is often used as a fire starter. The chemical formula for magnesium is Mg.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

Saturn's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as Mercury's.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.

 Hint: In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

milk going sour
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Hint: Biotite has the following properties:
pure substance

solid
fragile
fixed crystal structure
not made by organisms
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

Water is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Over 98% of the molecules in your body are water molecules. The chemical formula for water is H2O.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

Carbon tetrachloride is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Carbon tetrachloride was once used in fire extinguishers. It is no longer used because it is poisonous. The chemical formula for carbon tetrachloride is CCl4.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) a hairless body
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).
Coco is a cat from this group. Coco has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body hair gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

As these plates collide, the oceanic crust of the Nazca Plate subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust of the South American Plate, forming the Peru-Chile Trench.
 Lecture: The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
ocean-continent subduction zone
One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-continent subduction zone, which forms when a plate with oceanic crust and a plate with continental crust move toward each other. The oceanic crust subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust.
As the oceanic crust subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes called a volcanic arc.

 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) yes (1) no
 Hint: Siltstone has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
not a pure substance
not made by organisms
solid
found in nature
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black wool (1) ll
 Hint: In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for white wool, and the allele l is for black wool.
Moxie, a sheep from this group, has black wool. Moxie has two alleles for black wool.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: This organism is a European hedgehog. Its scientific name is Erinaceus europaeus.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) potato leaves (1) ll
 Hint: This passage describes the leaf type trait in tomato plants:

In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have regular leaves and others have potato leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf type trait has two alleles. The allele L is for regular leaves, and the allele l is for potato leaves.
A certain tomato plant from this group has potato leaves. This plant has two alleles for potato leaves.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

My friends walk along the path.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.

Monica has no school spirit—she never comes to any of our football games.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct (1) false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist

2244	2244	"Question: Is granodiorite a mineral or a rock?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mineral (1) rock
 Hint: Granodiorite has the following properties:
naturally occurring
not made by living things
coarse-grained texture
no fixed crystal structure
solid
not a pure substance
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

pouring milk on oatmeal
erosion caused by wind
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: This organism is a pink skunk clownfish. Its scientific name is Amphiprion perideraion.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Camelus bactrianus (1) Equus grevyi (2) Macropus giganteus
 Hint: This organism is a Grevy's zebra. Its scientific name is Equus grevyi.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The supply will probably go down. (1) The supply will probably go up.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up.

 Lecture: A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the block of iron with less mass (1) the block of iron with more mass
 Hint: The objects are made of the same type of matter.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": 0,
 ""solution"": ""The block of iron with less mass has less thermal energy.  Since both blocks have the same temperature, the atoms are moving at the same speed in each block.  The block with less mass has fewer atoms, so it has less total thermal energy.""

Silicon carbide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Silicon carbide is a hard substance used in car brakes and in bulletproof vests. The chemical formula for silicon carbide is SiC.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.

 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Choices: (0) CHI (1) C2I5 (2) CI4 (3) I4
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

acid rain weathering a marble statue
baking a loaf of bread
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) North America (1) Australia (2) Europe
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

What time the purple apples come to juice
And what month brings the shy forget-me-not. (1) My vigor is a new-minted penny,
Which I cast at your feet.
Gather it up from the dust,
That its sparkle may amuse you.
 Hint: From Claude McKay, ""Flame-Heart"" and from Amy Lowell, ""A Lady""
 Lecture: Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,

Glucose is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Glucose is a type of sugar and an energy source for organisms. The chemical formula for glucose is C6H12O6.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

Figure: barn swallow.
 Lecture: An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) She knows a cheap release
From worry and from pain—
The cowboys spur their horses
Over the unending plain. (1) So I gazed on this unhappy thing
With wonder and surprise,
While sadly with his waving wing
He wiped his weeping eyes.
 Hint: From Charlotte Perkins Gilman, ""A Conservative"" and from Florence Kiper Frank, ""The Movies""
 Lecture: Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
—From Edgar Allen Poe, ""The Raven""
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

Newly poured concrete becoming hard is a ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chemical change (1) physical change
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Epiphytic orchids are flowering plants that can grow in tropical forests. An orchid can grow on tree branches in the canopy, or upper layer of the forest.
In the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight than it would in the shadowy lower parts of the forest. The additional sunlight allows the orchid to perform more photosynthesis. There is also more wind in the canopy, which helps the orchid spread its seeds to other branches.
The orchid does not damage the tree it grows on, but it also does not provide resources to the tree.
Figure: epiphytic orchids growing on trees in a tropical forest.
 Lecture: When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.
This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.
Type of symbiotic relationship | Organism of one species... | Organism of the other species...

 Lecture: The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

2359	2359	"Question: What type of rock is dolostone?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metamorphic (1) sedimentary (2) igneous
 Hint: Dolostone is a rock that forms from ocean sediment. Dolostone is made mostly of the mineral dolomite. This piece of dolostone also contains yellow grains of the mineral sulphur.
Ocean sediment can contain the shells of marine organisms. As many layers of ocean sediment build up, the shells can go through a chemical reaction that forms new minerals, such as dolomite. Dolostone forms when these chemically changed sediments are pressed together to form rock.
 Lecture: Igneous rock is formed when melted rock cools and hardens into solid rock. This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder bowl of oatmeal (1) the hotter bowl of oatmeal
 Hint: Two bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

water evaporating from a lake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having Thomsen disease (1) Mm
 Hint: This passage describes the Thomsen disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have Thomsen disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having Thomsen disease, and the allele m is for not having Thomsen disease.
Tammy, a human from this group, has Thomsen disease. Tammy has one allele for having Thomsen disease and one allele for not having Thomsen disease.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) hasty generalization: a very broad claim based on very little evidence (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A sentence is a group of words that expresses a complete thought.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) decreased (1) stayed the same (2) increased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
Trent rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill.
 Lecture: Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a purple ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

Fluoromethane is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Fluoromethane can be used in the part of a refrigerator that keeps the temperature low. The chemical formula for fluoromethane is CH3F.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Lecture: Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) neither; their concentrations are the same (1) Solution B (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

2441	2441	"Question: Based on this information, what is Oliver's phenotype for the ear type trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) curled ears (1) EE
 Hint: In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele E is for curled ears, and the allele e is for straight ears.
Oliver, an American curl cat from this group, has curled ears. Oliver has two alleles for curled ears.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) attract (1) repel
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

Cobalt is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Cobalt is a metal found in substances that make paint blue. The chemical formula for cobalt is Co.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) air inside a bubble (1) clothespin (2) beans (3) lemonade
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Choices: (0) North America (1) Europe (2) Asia
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

2487	2487	"Question: Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
The four largest planets are made mainly of gas or ice.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) true (1) false
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15

 Choices: (0) His deep voice is a foghorn. (1) His voice is as deep as a foghorn.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It eats a primary consumer. (1) It eats a producer. (2) It eats a tertiary consumer.
 Hint: This diagram shows a food chain from Chesapeake Bay, an estuary ecosystem in Maryland and Virginia.
 Lecture: Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the plate of spaghetti with more thermal energy (1) the plate of spaghetti with less thermal energy
 Hint: Two plates of spaghetti are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Hint: This organism is a smooth newt. Its scientific name is Lissotriton vulgaris.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

dust settling out of the air
pouring milk on oatmeal
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) to the left than to the right (1) to the right than to the left
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a green ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

 Choices: (0) The new documentary, they claim, is one of the best ever made. (1) The new documentary, critics claim, is one of the best ever made.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) handsaw (1) door (2) air inside a balloon (3) marbles
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Fgfr1a1 protein . . . fgfr1a1 gene (1) fgfr1a1 gene . . . Fgfr1a1 protein
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Common carp are a type of fish that have scales on their bodies. The pattern of scales on a common carp is established while the fish is developing inside its egg. During this time, a protein called Fgfr1a1 sends signals to the fish's body that direct the shape and spacing of the fish's scales. The signals from the Fgfr1a1 protein result in common carp with small, evenly spaced scales.
The Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene.
A certain carp had large, patchy scales because of a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene. Compared to the fgfr1a1 gene without a mutation, the mutated fgfr1a1 gene encoded a form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the Fgfr1a1 protein could not send signals to the fish's body.
Figure: common carp with large, patchy scales (top), and small, evenly spaced scales.
 Lecture: An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.
An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.

 Lecture: Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

 Hint: This organism is a maroon clownfish. Its scientific name is Premnas biaculeatus.
 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) to the left than to the right (1) to the right than to the left
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a green ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way.

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Acacia ants spend most of their lives on bullhorn acacia trees. Up to 30,000 ants can live together in a colony on one acacia tree!
The ants eat nectar produced by the tree and build nests inside hollowed-out thorns on the tree's branches. The ants also attack insects and other animals that try to eat the tree's leaves. Sometimes the ants leave the tree and destroy nearby plants. This creates open space around the tree. The open space makes it easier for the acacia tree to get resources such as sunlight and water.
Figure: acacia ants feeding on nectar of a bullhorn acacia tree.
 Lecture: When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) repel (1) attract
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.

Hint: Magnets that attract pull together. Magnets that repel push apart.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have light yellow flowers and others have dark yellow flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for light yellow flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for dark yellow flowers (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) to the right than to the left (1) to the left than to the right
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a green ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have light yellow flowers and others have dark yellow flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for light yellow flowers, and the allele f is for dark yellow flowers.
A certain rose plant from this group has light yellow flowers. This plant has one allele for light yellow flowers and one allele for dark yellow flowers.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder helium balloon (1) the hotter helium balloon
 Hint: Two helium balloons are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

2589	2589	"Question: Based on this information, what is Maverick's phenotype for the coat graying trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having a graying coat (1) having a graying coat
 Hint: This passage describes the coat graying trait in horses:

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for not having a graying coat (g) is recessive to the allele for having a graying coat (G).
Maverick is a horse from this group. Maverick has the heterozygous genotype Gg for the coat graying gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": ""1"",
 ""solution"": ""Maverick has the genotype Gg, meaning he has one dominant allele (G) for having a graying coat and one recessive allele (g) for not having a graying coat. Since the dominant allele (G) determines the phenotype, Maverick's phenotype is having a graying coat.""

Saturn's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as Mercury's.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) false (1) true
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) igneous (1) sedimentary (2) metamorphic
 Hint: This is a piece of rhyolite. Rhyolite forms through the cooling of melted rock. It is made of minerals such as quartz and feldspar.
This piece of rhyolite has both large and small mineral grains. The difference in size tells you that the melted rock cooled at two different speeds. The large grains formed when the cooling was slow. The small grains formed later, when the cooling was faster.

Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface. Over time, the old rock becomes a new rock with different properties.

 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a normal-sized body, and the allele b is for a dwarf body.
Thumper, a rat from this group, has a dwarf body. Thumper has two alleles for a dwarf body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) to the right than to the left (1) to the left than to the right
 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a green ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rough fur (1) soft fur
 Hint: In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f).
Gruff is a dachshund dog from this group. Gruff has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) CmACO1 gene . . . CmACO1 protein (1) CmACO1 protein . . . CmACO1 gene
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

In plants such as the European cantaloupe, fruit ripening is affected by a substance called ethylene (ETH-uh-leen). Ethylene is made inside a plant's cells with the help of a protein called CmACO1. The CmACO1 protein is encoded by the CmACO1 gene.
A certain European cantaloupe plant had a mutation in its CmACO1 gene. Compared to the CmACO1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CmACO1 gene encoded a form of the CmACO1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the CmACO1 protein could make only a small amount of ethylene. The fruits of this plant took longer to ripen than fruits from plants containing more ethylene. Farmers found this mutation useful because the fruit stayed good for a longer period of time after harvest.
Figure: a European cantaloupe.
 Lecture: An organism's genes contain information about its proteins. Each gene encodes, or contains the instructions for making, one protein or a group of proteins.
A permanent change in a gene is called a mutation. Because a mutation changes a gene, the mutation may change the structure of the protein encoded by that gene.
The function of a protein depends on its structure. So, if a mutation in a gene changes a protein's structure, the mutation may also change the protein's function.
An organism's observable traits are affected by the functions of its proteins. So, a gene mutation that affects a protein's function may also affect an organism's observable traits.

When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Diorite has the following properties:
no fixed crystal structure
naturally occurring
not a pure substance
coarse-grained texture
solid
not made by organisms
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) boron trifluoride (BF3) (1) xenon (Xe) (2) fluoromethane (CH3F)
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ff (1) terminal flowers
 Hint: This passage describes the flower position trait in pea plants:

In a group of pea plants, some individuals have axial flowers and others have terminal flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower position trait has two alleles. The allele F is for axial flowers, and the allele f is for terminal flowers.
A certain pea plant from this group has terminal flowers. This plant has two alleles for terminal flowers.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

an iceberg melting slowly
cooking a pancake
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each blue ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 3:1
 Hint: This passage describes the coat pattern trait in cheetahs:
A cheetah with a spotted coat has many small black spots on its body. A cheetah with a king coat has large black splotches on its body and stripes on its back. King cheetahs are rarely seen in the wild. They were once thought to be a different species.
In a group of cheetahs, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a king coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a king coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a spotted coat (A).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cheetahs.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

Jupiter's volume is more than ten times as large as Saturn's volume.
 Task: true-or false
 Choices: (0) false (1) true
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Lecture: A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) complex (1) simple (2) compound-complex (3) compound
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.

Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

 Hint: This diagram shows a food chain from the River Frome, a freshwater ecosystem in England.
 Lecture: Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) South America (1) Antarctica (2) Australia
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

Methane is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is used in homes for heating and cooking. The chemical formula for methane is CH4.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Choices: (0) the bath towel with less thermal energy (1) the bath towel with more thermal energy
 Hint: Two 525-gram bath towels are identical except for their thermal energies.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) BB (1) a hairy body
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Nico, a cat from this group, has a hairy body. Nico has two alleles for a hairy body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

shaking up salad dressing
beating an egg
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Task: yes or no
 Choices: (0) no (1) yes
 Hint: Wool has the following properties:
solid
not a pure substance
found in nature
made by an animal
no fixed crystal structure
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

 Lecture: Poets often use the sounds of words to create interesting effects and to express moods and emotions. Understanding these elements of poetry can help you better interpret and appreciate poetic forms.
Anaphora is the repetition of words or sequences of words at the beginning of multiple phrases, sentences, or lines.
Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,
Out of the mocking-bird's throat, the musical shuttle,
Out of the Ninth-month midnight
—From Walt Whitman, ""Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Assonance is the repetition of vowel sounds. Often, assonance can create rhymes or near-rhymes within lines.
I wandered lonely as a Cloud
That floats on high o'er Vales and Hills,
When all at once I saw a crowd,
A host of golden Daffodils.
—From William Wordsworth, ""I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud""
Meter is a poem's rhythm, or the pattern of strong and weak syllables. Strong syllables are stressed, while weak syllables are unstressed.
A poem has an iambic meter when the beat sounds like da-DUM. A weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Occasionally, a line may begin with a strong syllable.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
A poem has a trochaic meter when the beat sounds like DUM-da. A strong syllable is followed by a weak syllable. Occasionally, a line may end in a strong syllable.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
—From Edgar Allen Poe, ""The Raven""
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb.

The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Choices: (0) repel (1) attract
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a yellow ground spot (1) a white ground spot
 Hint: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:

In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g).
A certain watermelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the ground spot color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

 Hint: The diagram below shows a solution with one solute. Each solute particle is represented by a purple ball. The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion.
 Lecture: In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal.

The rift valley along the Knipovich Ridge formed at a () boundary.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) transform (1) convergent (2) divergent
 Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture.
The Knipovich Ridge and its rift valley mark the northernmost mid-ocean ridge in the Atlantic Ocean. This mid-ocean ridge and rift valley are the result of the Eurasian Plate and the North American Plate moving away from each other.
There are several volcanoes in the rift valley, as well as cracks in the crust called hydrothermal vents. At these vents, cold ocean water sinks into the crust, is heated by hot magma, and rises back to the surface. The heated ocean water can reach temperatures up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit!
 Lecture: The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 26 kilometers (1) 26 centimeters
 Hint: Select the better estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

2827	2827	"Question: Read the following excerpt from a student essay. How can the writer best improve his or her organization?
Many students, parents, and teachers cringe at the idea of sending kids to school year-round, but it would improve academic performance. Lengthy summer vacations were not established to accommodate farming schedules, as most people assume; they were started so that wealthy families could leave the city in the hot summer months and vacation in the country. Studies have shown that as a result of ""summer slide,"" many students returning to school in the fall have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Year-round school would provide consistency and help students learn more.

ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red fruit (1) FF
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have red fruit and others have yellow fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for red fruit, and the allele f is for yellow fruit.
A certain tomato plant from this group has red fruit. This plant has two alleles for red fruit.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Lecture: Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.

2850	2850	"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
burning a marshmallow over a campfire
an engine using gasoline to power a car
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Beryllium is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Beryllium is a strong, lightweight metal used to make mirrors for space telescopes. The chemical formula for beryllium is Be.
 Lecture: There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Graphite has the following properties:
dark gray
fixed crystal structure
made of a pure substance called carbon
found in nature
not made by living things
solid
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Ll (1) fuzzy leaves
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele L is for fuzzy leaves, and the allele l is for smooth leaves.
A certain summer squash plant from this group has fuzzy leaves. This plant has one allele for fuzzy leaves and one allele for smooth leaves.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 20 fluid ounces (1) 20 gallons (2) 20 cups
 Hint: Select the best estimate.
 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon.

2868	2868	"Question: Based on this information, what is Sandy's phenotype for the body color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a golden body (1) a gray body
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b).
Sandy is a guppy from this group. Sandy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Lecture: Poetry is a special kind of writing. It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel
In vest of shining white,
In coat of silver gray,
And vest of shining white.
—Adapted from Mary E. Burt, ""The Flying Squirrel""
Alliteration is when beginning consonant sounds are repeated in words that are close together.
Where the wild men watched and waited
Wolves in the forest, and bears in the bush.
—From Bayard Taylor, ""A Night with a Wolf""
Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.

 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Lecture: Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:
Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a normal-sized body, and the allele b is for a dwarf body.
Penny, a rat from this group, has a dwarf body. Penny has two alleles for a dwarf body.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Lecture: Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard.

 Hint: In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for brown eyes (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two guinea pigs.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Lecture: Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

2926	2926	"Question: Based on this information, what is Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black fur (1) brown fur
 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
Bandit is a Labrador retriever from this group. Bandit has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Hydrogen sulfide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas that is produced by some types of bacteria found in swamps and marshes. The chemical formula for hydrogen sulfide is H2S.
 Lecture: Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms.

bending a paper clip
cracking open a peanut
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by heating. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.

2953	2953	"Question: Based on this information, what is Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Pebbles is a guppy from this group. Pebbles has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

{

 ""solution"": ""Pebbles has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene. This means that she has two copies of the recessive allele (i) for the tail spots trait.

 Hint: In a group of Bengal tigers, some individuals have orange fur and others have white fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for white fur (f) is recessive to the allele for orange fur (F).
Athena is a Bengal tiger from this group. Athena has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem. The ecosystem is in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web is a model that shows how the matter eaten by living things moves through an ecosystem. The arrows show how matter moves through the food web.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
Models can make things in nature easier to understand. Models can be simpler than the things they represent. A food web is a model that shows where living things in an ecosystem get their food. If a food web showed every living thing in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some living things in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one living thing to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one living thing eats another living thing. An arrow starts from the living thing that is eaten. The arrow points to the living thing that is doing the eating.
A living thing in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the living thing is eaten by more than one other living thing in the food web.
A living thing in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the living thing eats more than one other living thing in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Africa (1) Asia (2) South America
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

 Hint: The male part of a flower makes pollen.
 Lecture: Many plants have flowers. These plants can use their flowers to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do plants use their flowers to reproduce?
First, the male part of the flower makes pollen, and the female part makes eggs. Animals, wind, or water can move pollen. Pollination is what happens when pollen is moved to the female part of the flower.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with the eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds. The fruit grows around the seeds. Later, a seed can fall out of the fruit. It can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Choices: (0) Abby had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. The operator promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene. (1) Abby had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. They promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having sickle-cell disease (1) Aa
 Hint: This passage describes the sickle-cell disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have sickle-cell disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the sickle-cell disease trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having sickle-cell disease, and the allele a is for having sickle-cell disease.
Deion, a human from this group, does not have sickle-cell disease. Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease and one allele for having sickle-cell disease.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rock (1) mineral
 Hint: Calcarenite has the following properties:
yellow-brown
not made by organisms
not a pure substance
found in nature
solid
no fixed crystal structure
 Lecture: Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a liquid (1) a solid (2) a gas
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

 Hint: This diagram shows a food chain from Chesapeake Bay, an estuary ecosystem in Maryland and Virginia.
 Lecture: Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

an antacid tablet reacting with water
acid rain weathering a marble statue
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

 Hint: This diagram shows a food chain from a grassland ecosystem in Wyoming.
 Lecture: Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 0:4 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats.
 Lecture: Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.

 Choices: (0) The helicopter has a constant velocity. (1) The helicopter is accelerating.
 Hint: A rescue helicopter is moving directly upward at a constant speed.
 Lecture: An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.
An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:
speeding up,
slowing down, or
changing direction.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the colder soap bubble (1) the hotter soap bubble
 Hint: Two soap bubbles are identical except for their temperatures.
 Lecture: Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the snowboards with wax added (1) the snowboards with wax removed
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Justine and Tanner were taking a snowboarding class. During the class, their instructor said they would go faster if they applied wax to the undersides of their snowboards.
After the class, Justine applied a thin layer of wax to the underside of a snowboard and rode the board straight down a hill. Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. Tanner timed how long each ride took. Justine repeated these rides on four other snowboards, alternating whether she first rode with or without wax.
Figure: a snowboarder.
 Lecture: Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height.

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) repel (1) attract
 Hint: Two magnets are placed as shown.
 Lecture: Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.

It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside.

sewing an apron
melting glass
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are chemical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change.

Sean is not qualified to run the Environmental Club. Have you seen his sister's huge, horrifically inefficient car? The planet cries whenever she turns on the ignition.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straw man: a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against (1) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something (2) bandwagon fallacy: the assumption that the popular choice is automatically correct
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences

Fanning eggs increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in (1) the male's offspring will become adults (2) the male will spend more energy while waving his fins
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time. This behavior is called fanning.
By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch.
Figure: a fifteen-spined stickleback.
 Lecture: Animals increase their reproductive success when they have offspring that survive to reproduce.
Animals can increase their chances of having offspring by behaving in ways that help them get partners to mate and reproduce with. These partners are called mates. For example, animals may make special sounds, perform specific dances, or show off bright colors to attract mates. Animals may also compete with each other for mates.
Animals can increase the chances that their offspring will survive to reproduce by caring for and protecting them. For example, animals may feed their offspring or guard them from predators. These behaviors increase the chances that the offspring will survive to adulthood, when they can reproduce.
Many behaviors can increase the chances that animals will have offspring that survive to reproduce. But the behaviors cannot guarantee that the animals will have greater reproductive success. Animals that attract or compete for mates won't always successfully mate and reproduce, and offspring that are fed and protected won't always survive to adulthood.

3121	3121	"Question: Based on this information, what is Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Sebastian is a guppy from this group. Sebastian has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

{

 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) neither; their concentrations are the same (2) Solution A
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each yellow ball represents one particle of solute.
 Lecture: A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent

 Choices: (0) ethos (character) (1) logos (reason) (2) pathos (emotion)
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) cytoplasm (1) mitochondria (2) cell wall (3) cell membrane
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) by dropping pollen on the anthers (1) by dropping pollen on the pistil
 Hint: This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.
 Lecture: Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) ff (1) brown fur
 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
Hachiko, a Labrador retriever from this group, has brown fur. Hachiko has two alleles for brown fur.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.

not a pure substance
 Lecture: Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straight fur (1) wavy fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Briar is a Syrian hamster from this group. Briar has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur texture gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

3198	3198	"Question: Based on this information, what is Skeeter's phenotype for the body hair trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) a hairless body
 Hint: In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairless body (b) is recessive to the allele for a hairy body (B).
Skeeter is a deer mouse from this group. Skeeter has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene.
 Lecture: All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gas (1) a liquid (2) a solid
 Hint: N/A
 Lecture: Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Lecture: A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
