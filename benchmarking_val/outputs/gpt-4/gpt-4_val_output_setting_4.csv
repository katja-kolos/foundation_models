	"What does the verbal irony in this text suggest?
According to Mr. Herrera's kids, his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer."	['The snoring is loud.', 'The snoring occurs in bursts.']	0		closed choice	grade8	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Interpret figures of speech	"Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
Verbal irony involves saying one thing but implying something very different. People often use verbal irony when they are being sarcastic.
Olivia seems thrilled that her car keeps breaking down.
Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Herrera's snoring."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text uses the phrase ""as quiet as a jackhammer"" to describe Mr. Herrera's snoring, which is a clear example of verbal irony. This phrase is ironic because jackhammers are known to be extremely loud. Therefore, by comparing the volume of Mr. Herrera's snoring to a jackhammer, the text implies that his snoring is very loud, rather than quiet. Hence, the correct answer is (0) The snoring is loud."

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the sturgeon.
The sturgeon's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding. The sturgeon uses its mouth to find food hidden in the sediment at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The armored catfish's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding.
The discus's mouth is not located on the underside of its head. Its mouth is not adapted for bottom feeding."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The armored catfish's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward, which is a similar adaptation to the sturgeon, a bottom feeder. This indicates that the armored catfish is also adapted for bottom feeding. On the other hand, the discus's mouth is not located on the underside of its head and is not adapted for bottom feeding. Therefore, the answer is the armored catfish."

Here is one way to fix the sentence fragment:
During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock were removed from the mountain to create the monument."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The given text is a sentence fragment because it does not contain a complete thought or idea. The action of what was done with the ""eight hundred million pounds of rock"" is missing. Therefore, it lacks a main clause or independent clause that can stand alone as a sentence. A possible fix could be: ""During the construction of Mount Rushmore, workers removed approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock from the mountain to create the monument."""
	Which correctly shows the title of a play?	['A breath of Fresh Air', 'A Breath of Fresh Air']	1		closed choice	grade3	language science	capitalization	Formatting	Capitalizing titles	"In a title, capitalize the first word, the last word, and every important word in between.

Short prepositions, such as at, by, for, in, of, on, to, up
Coordinating conjunctions, such as and, but, or"	"Capitalize the first word, the last word, and every important word in between. The word of is not important, so it should not be capitalized.
The correct title is A Breath of Fresh Air."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The convention of title case in English language dictates that the first and last words of the title, and all the principal words in between should be capitalized. Prepositions like 'of' are not typically capitalized unless they are the first or last word. Therefore, the correct title of the play is 'A Breath of Fresh Air'."

Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the passage carefully.
Chicago is known as The Windy City. But on average, the wind there only blows at about 10 miles per hour.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the usual wind patterns in Chicago. This passage does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage discusses the general wind patterns in Chicago, which is an aspect of climate. It mentions that the wind there ""on average"" only blows at about 10 miles per hour. This is an average condition over a period of time, not a specific instance or day's weather. Therefore, the passage is describing the climate of Chicago, not the weather."
	Based on this information, what is Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait?	['not having horns', 'having horns']	0	"In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Daffodil's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Daffodil's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is HH, which is homozygous for the dominant allele. In genetics, the dominant allele is the one that is expressed in the phenotype, regardless of the other allele. Since the H allele represents not having horns, Daffodil's phenotype is not having horns. This is consistent with the information given that the H allele is dominant to the h allele."

The New Zealand falcon has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey.
The sable has hoofed feet. Its feet are not adapted for grabbing prey. The sable uses its feet to walk and run on hard ground."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The New Zealand falcon is chosen as the correct answer because, like the bald eagle, it has long toes with sharp claws. This adaptation allows it to effectively grab and hold onto its prey, similar to the bald eagle. On the other hand, the sable has hoofed feet, which are not adapted for grabbing prey but for walking and running on hard ground."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=355x307 at 0x313ADA5A0>	"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	['true', 'false']	1	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	"ANSWER: (1) false
SOLUTION: To verify this statement, we would need to multiply Mars's volume by 10,000 and compare it to Jupiter's volume. However, the given data shows that Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3 (10,000 times the volume of Mars). Therefore, the statement is false because Jupiter's volume is not more than 10,000 times the volume of Mars."
	"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
A light spattering of raindrops fell upon the stadium, () the fans' cheeks."	['landing on', 'kissing']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Creative techniques	Use personification	"Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.

The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the word kissing. It describes the raindrops as if they were people showing affection.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ""kissing"" because personification is a figure of speech where inanimate objects, animals, or ideas are given human qualities or actions. In this case, ""kissing"" is a human action, thus giving the raindrops human characteristics. On the other hand, ""landing on"" does not provide any human qualities to the raindrops, making it an incorrect choice for personification."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank is 40 liters.
40 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The volume of a car's gas tank is typically measured in liters, not milliliters. A milliliter is a very small unit of measurement, and 40 milliliters would not be nearly enough to fuel a car. Therefore, 40 liters is the appropriate volume for a carâ€™s gas tank.

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Ecosystems	Interpret food webs	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Consumers eat other organisms. So, there are arrows in a food web that point from other organisms to consumers.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. So, the barren-ground caribou is a consumer.
The bear sedge does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the bear sedge is a producer, not a consumer."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The barren-ground caribou is a consumer because it has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen, indicating that it consumes the lichen. This follows the rules of a food web in which the arrows represent the flow of matter from one organism to another (i.e., who eats whom). On the other hand, the bear sedge has no arrows pointing to it, which means it does not consume other organisms, making it a producer, not a consumer."

['a ship that moved 555kilometers west in 10hours', 'a ship that moved 95kilometers south in 10hours', 'a ship that moved 460kilometers south in 10hours']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 10 hours. The ship that moved 95 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance it covers by the time it takes. In this case, all three ships were moving for the same amount of time, so the ship that covered the least distance would have the lowest speed. The ship that moved 95 kilometers in 10 hours covered the least distance, therefore, it was moving at the lowest speed."

In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele F is for short fur, and the allele f is for long fur.
Sasha, a dog from this group, has short fur. Sasha has one allele for short fur and one allele for long fur."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Sasha's observable version of the fur length trait is short fur. So, Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is short fur.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Sasha's phenotype is determined by the visible characteristic, which in this case is the fur length. Although Sasha has both alleles for short (F) and long (f) fur, the description clearly states that Sasha has short fur. Hence, the answer is 'short fur' which corresponds to choice 1."

SOLUTION: The compound sentence is ""Our dog Rusty had rolled around in the mud, so we gave him a bath."" This sentence is considered a compound sentence because it contains two independent clauses that are joined by a coordinating conjunction 'so'. Each of these clauses could stand alone as a complete sentence, hence making the sentence compound.

The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black eyes. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red eyes."	"ANSWER: (2) 4:0
SOLUTION: The question involves a Punnett square where all 4 boxes represent the genotype 'ee', indicating black eyes - the recessive trait. There are no boxes with the genotype 'EE' or 'Ee', which would indicate red eyes - the dominant trait. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0, meaning all offspring are expected to have black eyes based on the provided genetic cross."

He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the shopping bag that is heavier.
A shopping bag holding 5 pounds of food is heavier than a shopping bag holding 4 pounds of food. So, the bag holding 5 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other bag."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The force required to move an object is directly proportional to its weight. In this case, the two shopping bags have different weights: 4 pounds and 5 pounds. Consequently, the bag with 5 pounds of food requires a larger force to be lifted at the same speed as the bag with 4 pounds of food. So, the correct answer is the bag holding 5 pounds of food."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something

"	The text argues that Richard can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Richard can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text is using guilt by association, suggesting that because Richard's uncle was guilty of embezzlement, Richard might also be untrustworthy, even though there is no direct evidence of any wrongdoing on Richard's part. This is a fallacy because one's character or actions cannot be determined based on their association with someone else. Therefore, the correct answer is '1 - guilt by association'."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
Rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bicycle frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But rust forming on a bicycle frame is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: Both cooking a pancake and rust forming on a bicycle frame are chemical changes. In cooking the pancake, the batter changes into a different substance. Similarly, the formation of rust is a reaction between iron and oxygen, resulting in a different substance again.

In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Chanel is a cat from this group. Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Chanel's genotype for the fur length gene is FF. Chanel's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for short fur. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chanel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chanel's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Chanel's genotype for the fur length gene is FF, which are two dominant alleles. The dominant allele in this case is for short fur. Therefore, Chanel's phenotype, or the physical expression of these genes, would be short fur. This is why the answer is 0, for short fur."

There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a can of soup is 12 ounces.
12 pounds and 12 tons are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A can of soup typically weighs around 12 ounces. This weight includes both the soup and the can itself. In comparison, 12 pounds and 12 tons are significantly heavier and are not realistic weights for a can of soup. Therefore, the best estimate for the mass of a can of soup is 12 ounces."

In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two summer squash plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with fuzzy leaves or smooth leaves, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for fuzzy leaves, is dominant over the l allele, which is for smooth leaves.
Fuzzy leaves is the dominant allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the dominant version of the leaf texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy leaves must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
Smooth leaves is the recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the recessive version of the leaf texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with smooth leaves must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with fuzzy leaves for every 2 offspring with smooth leaves."	"ANSWER: 4
SOLUTION: The question tells us that the allele for fuzzy leaves is dominant, meaning that if an offspring has even one of these alleles, it will have fuzzy leaves. By looking at the Punnett square, we can see that there are 2 boxes with the genotype LL or Ll, representing fuzzy leaves, and 2 boxes with the genotype ll, representing smooth leaves. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is 2:2, which is equivalent to 1:1, and corresponds to choice 4."

Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, miss. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""We will miss you very much!"" uses the future tense. This is ascertained from the use of the auxiliary verb 'will' before the main verb 'miss'. In English language, 'will' is used to express actions that will happen in the future, hence it indicates the future tense."
	Select the vertebrate.	['pipevine swallowtail butterfly', 'ladybug', 'great blue heron', 'crown jellyfish']	2	Hint: Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are vertebrates.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Classification	Identify vertebrates and invertebrates	"Vertebrates and invertebrates are both groups of animals.
A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body."	"A ladybug is an insect. Like other insects, a ladybug is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
A great blue heron is a bird. Like other birds, a great blue heron is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
Like other jellyfishes, a crown jellyfish is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has a soft body.
A pipevine swallowtail butterfly is an insect. Like other insects, a pipevine swallowtail butterfly is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The great blue heron is the correct choice as it is a bird, and birds are classified as vertebrates, meaning they have a backbone or spine. The other animals provided - the pipevine swallowtail butterfly, ladybug, and crown jellyfish - are all invertebrates, meaning they do not have a backbone or spine. Therefore, the great blue heron is the only vertebrate in the list."

Jinx, a cat from this group, does not have agouti fur. Jinx has two alleles for not having agouti fur."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Jinx has two alleles for not having agouti fur (a). So, Jinx's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task provides information that Jinx, the cat, does not have agouti fur and that it has two alleles for not having the agouti fur trait. Given the choices, and the fact that the allele 'a' stands for not having agouti fur, the correct choice would be 'aa', which represents Jinx's genotype. Therefore, the answer is 0."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force.

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of gneiss match the properties of a rock. So, gneiss is a rock.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Gneiss is categorized as a rock based on the provided properties. It's not a pure substance which means it's composed of different materials, a characteristic of rocks. It also has no fixed crystal structure, another trait common in rocks. Moreover, it's mentioned that it's made of light and dark mineral grains, which implies that it is a rock formed from these minerals."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
a piece of apple turning brown
bleaching clothes"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	0		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The reaction changes the stains into different types of matter that wash away easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (0)
SOLUTION: Both a piece of apple turning brown and bleaching clothes involve a chemical change, where the initial substances (the apple and the stains) react to form new substances (brown apple and colorless stains). This process is not merely a physical change (which might involve a change in the state, shape, or size of a substance), but a chemical one, as new substances are formed. Also, neither change is triggered by heating or cooling. Thus, the correct answer is (0) Both are chemical changes."

24 millimeters is too short. 24 meters and 24 kilometers are too long."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the length of a hammer is 24 centimeters. This is because hammers are typically handheld tools that are not too large. 24 millimeters is too short for a hammer, as it would be difficult to use. On the other hand, 24 meters and 24 kilometers are excessively long for a hammer, making them impractical for use."

	Assume all other forces on Kylie are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Kylie?	['The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Kylie.', 'The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie.']	1	Kylie is sitting on a roller coaster cart as it reaches the bottom of a big loop. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kylie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kylie with a force of 1,200N.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Kylie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Kylie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Kylie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The forces acting upon Kylie are unbalanced because the force exerted by the seat of the cart (1,200N) is greater than the force of gravity pulling her down (600N). Since these forces aren't equal, they don't cancel each other out, resulting in a net force. Therefore, the statement that describes the forces on Kylie is that they are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie."

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task is based on the principle that the strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as they move further apart. There are two pairs of magnets, Pair 1 and Pair 2. We are asked to identify which pair has a weaker magnetic force. As it is mentioned that the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than those in Pair 2, we can conclude that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1."

It is a pure substance.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
A brick is made by humans. But minerals are not made by living things.
A brick is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a brick is not a mineral.
Quartz is a mineral.
Graphite is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A brick is not a mineral because it is not a pure substance and is not formed in nature but made by humans. In contrast, minerals are naturally occurring substances and are pure, which means they have a definite chemical composition. Both Quartz and Graphite are formed in nature and are pure substances, which are characteristics of minerals. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 - a brick."

Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a bike path is 3 kilometers.
3 centimeters is too short."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A bike path is typically measured in kilometers, not centimeters. The length of a bike path can vary greatly, but it is usually a substantial distance intended for biking exercise or commute. 3 kilometers is a reasonable length for a bike path. On the other hand, 3 centimeters is extremely short, even shorter than the length of a bike itself, making it an unrealistic measurement for a bike path."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each speedboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each speedboat moved for 10 hours. The speedboat that moved 360 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that speedboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, all speedboats traveled for the same amount of time, 10 hours. Therefore, the speedboat that traveled the shortest distance, 360 kilometers in 10 hours, had the lowest speed. The direction of movement does not impact the speed, hence it is disregarded in this comparison."

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Regan's skin color is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Regan's naturally dark skin is an inherited trait because it is determined by the genes passed down from her parents. Human beings do not have control over their natural skin color, which is established before birth. Therefore, it is not an acquired trait, which would be something learned or developed after birth. Hence, the correct answer is 1, indicating that it's an inherited trait."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But cooking an egg is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both melting glass and cooking an egg involve the application of heat. Melting glass is a physical change, as it changes from solid to liquid state but still remains glass. Cooking an egg, on the other hand, is a chemical change, as the heat transforms the raw egg into a cooked one, changing its molecular structure. Therefore, the common factor is that both processes are caused by heating."

When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.

The Miranda warning, the reading of rights given to a suspect by police prior to questioning, is not unique to the United States; a number of other countries have equivalent rights, including Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, and Kazakhstan.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Miranda v. Arizona was one of a few Supreme Court cases to have implications for law enforcement, so it was not one of a kind in that respect. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverbâ€”as in most unique, very unique, or quite uniqueâ€”it is probably being used nontraditionally.

Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The traditional sense of the word ""unique"" is used in the second text because it means ""being the only one of its kind"". In this case, the Miranda warning is not unique to the United States, as other countries also have equivalent rights.

A compass rose is a set of arrows that point to the cardinal directions. A compass rose usually shows only the first letter of each cardinal direction.
The north arrow points to the North Pole. On most maps, north is at the top of the map."	To find the answer, look at the compass rose. Look at which way the west arrow is pointing. Mississippi is farthest west.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves identifying the geographical location of the given states in relation to the cardinal direction 'west'. By examining a map of the United States, we can see that of the four options, Georgia, Mississippi, Maine, and Vermont, Mississippi is located furthest to the west. This is because it is positioned more to the left (west) than the others when looking at the map. Therefore, the answer is 1, Mississippi."
	"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The midday sun () the hikers."	['glared at', 'warmed']	0		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Creative techniques	Use personification	"Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase glared at. It describes the sun as if it were a person giving an angry look.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task requires the use of personification, which is a figure of speech where non-human objects are given human attributes. The choice ""warmed"" is a typical function of the sun and does not give it any human traits. However, ""glared at"" implies the sun is intentionally looking at the hikers with intensity, thus attributing human characteristics to it. Therefore, the phrase ""glared at"" is the correct completion."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Bob's brother wasn't feeling well, so Bob had to stay home with him."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Bob had to stay home with his brother because he wasn't feeling well."" contains a vague pronoun reference. Here, the pronoun ""he"" does not specify clearly whether it refers to Bob or his brother, causing confusion. On the other hand, the sentence ""Bob's brother wasn't feeling well, so Bob had to stay home with him."" clearly states that Bob's brother was the one who was not feeling well, avoiding any ambiguity."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to play basketball. Instead, some people learn how to play basketball. Playing the sport takes practice. So, playing basketball is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Playing basketball is a skill that is learned and developed through practice, not a trait that is passed down through genetics. This makes it an acquired trait. Even though certain genetic traits, such as height, can influence one's ability to play basketball, the skill itself is not inherited. Therefore, Camilla's ability to play basketball is an acquired trait."

Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.

The water balloon fell toward her friend Paul, who was standing below the balcony."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Kinetic and potential energy	Identify changes in gravitational potential energy	"Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Paul was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Paul, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Paul."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The gravitational potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height from the ground. As the water balloon fell from the balcony towards Paul, it was getting closer to the ground, thus its height was decreasing. Hence, the gravitational potential energy of the water balloon was also decreasing. Therefore, the correct answer is 2 - the gravitational potential energy decreased."

	Which job does the circulatory system do?	['It breaks down food into small pieces.', 'It helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Animals	Body systems: circulation and respiration	"To stay alive, animal cells must get water and oxygen. Animal cells also produce carbon dioxide, a waste that must be removed. An animal's respiratory and circulatory systems work together to do these jobs.
An animal's respiratory system is made up of organs that work together to bring in oxygen gas from the environment. The respiratory system also removes carbon dioxide gas from the animal's body. Some animals have lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air. Other animals have gills to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with water.
An animal's circulatory system is made up of organs that work together to move blood through its body. The heart pumps blood through blood vessels throughout the body. As blood moves through blood vessels, it delivers oxygen, nutrients from food, and water to cells. Blood also absorbs waste, including carbon dioxide. When the blood is pumped into the lungs or gills, it releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen."	"The circulatory system brings oxygen, nutrients, and water to cells. It also helps remove carbon dioxide waste.
The circulatory system does not break down food into small pieces. This job is done by the digestive system. After the digestive system breaks down food, blood vessels in the intestines absorb the nutrients from the food. The blood then carries the nutrients to cells throughout the body."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The circulatory system is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and carbon dioxide waste throughout the body.

Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Granodiorite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, granodiorite is not a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Granodiorite, despite being naturally occurring and solid, does not possess a fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance. These two characteristics are crucial for a substance to be categorized as a mineral. Therefore, granodiorite cannot be considered a mineral."

Reggie has a scar on his left hand."	['acquired', 'inherited']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The trait mentioned, which is a scar on Reggie's left hand, is an acquired trait. This is because scars are not genetically passed down from parents to offspring, but rather are formed due to environmental influences such as accidents or surgeries. Such physical changes that occur during a person's lifetime are classified as acquired traits."

	Based on this information, what is Roxie's phenotype for the fur color trait?	['FF', 'black fur']	1	"In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
Roxie, a Labrador retriever from this group, has black fur. Roxie has two alleles for black fur."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Roxie's observable version of the fur color trait is black fur. So, Roxie's phenotype for the fur color trait is black fur.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task is about understanding the concept of phenotype in genetics. In this particular scenario, the phenotype refers to the observable trait or characteristic of an organism, which in this case is the fur color of Roxie, the Labrador retriever. Given that Roxie has black fur, her phenotype for the fur color trait is ""black fur"". Hence, the correct answer is choice 1."

A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body."	"A macaw is a bird. Like other birds, a macaw is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.

A tokay gecko is a reptile. Like other reptiles, a tokay gecko is a vertebrate. It has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The invertebrate among the choices is the giant wood wasp. As the hint suggests, insects are invertebrates, meaning they do not have a backbone but instead have an exoskeleton.

	Which basketball has a higher temperature?	['the basketball with more thermal energy', 'the basketball with less thermal energy']	0	Two basketballs are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two basketballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the basketball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The basketball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature. This is because temperature is directly proportional to the thermal energy of an object. The greater the thermal energy, the higher the temperature. In this case, both basketballs are identical except for their thermal energies, hence the basketball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: In the provided context, it is indicated that the particles in sample B have a higher mass and also move at a higher average speed than the particles in sample A.

28 millimeters and 28 centimeters are too short. 28 kilometers is too long."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A basketball court is not as small as 28 millimeters or 28 centimeters, these measurements are too short. Additionally, it is not as large as 28 kilometers, this measurement is excessively long. Therefore, the most suitable estimate for the length of a basketball court would be 28 meters."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a kitchen sink is 26 liters.
26 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The volume of a kitchen sink cannot be 26 milliliters because it is too small. A milliliter is a unit of volume in the metric system and it is often used to measure small amounts of liquid, usually in medicine or cooking. On the other hand, 26 liters is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a kitchen sink. A liter is a larger unit of volume and is commonly used to measure the capacity of containers. Therefore, 26 liters is the better estimate for the volume of a kitchen sink."

Kumal is a jaguar from this group. Kumal has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Kumal's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Kumal's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Kumal's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Kumal's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Kumal has a genotype of aa for the coat pattern gene, and the allele 'a' is associated with a spotted coat, therefore he will have a spotted coat. This is because he carries the recessive alleles, and in the absence of the dominant allele, the recessive trait manifests as the phenotype. Hence, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a spotted coat."

So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Mer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Mer's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Mer has a genotype of ii for the tail spots gene, which is homozygous recessive. The recessive trait in this case encodes for an unspotted tail. Since Mer only carries the recessive alleles, the resulting phenotype will be the one associated with those alleles, which is an unspotted tail. Therefore, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait is an unspotted tail."

It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The crocodile egg fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the feather fossil. So, the crocodile egg fossil is most likely younger than the feather fossil."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the principle of stratigraphy in geology, which stipulates that the lower layers of rock are older than the layers above. Hence, a fossil found in a shallower layer is generally younger. According to the given information, the crocodile egg fossil is found in a shallower layer than the feather fossil. Therefore, the crocodile egg fossil is younger."

SOLUTION: Both rust forming on a bicycle frame and grilling a hamburger are chemical changes. In the case of the bicycle frame, it goes through a process called oxidation where the iron reacts with oxygen to form rust. When grilling a hamburger, the heat causes a chemical reaction in the meat, changing its composition. Therefore, the commonality between these two changes is that they are both chemical changes."

Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"The air inside a balloon is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a balloon expands to fill all the space in the balloon. If the balloon pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The air inside a balloon is a gas. This is because gases have the ability to expand and fill up any given space, which is exactly what the air does when it fills a balloon. If the balloon bursts, the gas will spread out to fill a larger space. Unlike solids and liquids, gases are compressible and occupy the full volume of their containers, in this case, the balloon."
	What is the volume of a test tube?	['16 liters', '16 milliliters']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a test tube is 16 milliliters.
16 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A test tube is a small piece of laboratory glassware that is typically used to hold, mix, or heat small quantities of liquid or solid chemicals for laboratory testing or experiments. Its volume is usually measured in milliliters (ml), not liters (l), due to its small size. Therefore, the better estimate for the volume of a test tube is 16 milliliters. A volume of 16 liters would be far too large for a typical test tube."

Thor, a jaguar from this group, has a black coat. Thor has two alleles for a black coat."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Thor has two alleles for a black coat (A). So, Thor's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism, in this case, it is referring to Thor's coat pattern gene. Thor possesses two alleles for a black coat, denoted as ""A"". Given that the genotype is a combination of alleles, having two ""A"" alleles would make his genotype ""AA"". Hence, the answer is 1 (AA)."

A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"

['a bird that moved 25kilometers in 5hours', 'a bird that moved 15kilometers in 5hours']	0		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each bird moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bird moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other bird moved 15 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each bird spent the same amount of time moving. The bird that moved 25 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bird must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: (0)
SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by dividing the distance by time. The first bird moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours, which is a speed of 5 kilometers per hour. The second bird moved 15 kilometers in 5 hours, resulting in a speed of 3 kilometers per hour. Therefore, the bird that moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours was moving at a higher speed."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The hint and solution provide that the magnets in both pairs are made of the same material, are of the same size, and are at the same distance apart. While the direction of the force changes based on whether the magnets attract or repel each other, this does not affect the magnitude of the force. Thus, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a blender is 60 fluid ounces.
60 cups and 60 gallons are both too much."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The volume of a blender is typically measured in fluid ounces or cups, with most household blenders having a capacity of anywhere from 20 to 60 ounces. 60 gallons is far too large for a typical blender, and while 60 cups is also possible, it is generally too large for most household blenders. Therefore, 60 fluid ounces is the most reasonable estimate."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
milk going sour
roasting a marshmallow over a campfire"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Roasting is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Both changes are indeed chemical changes. A chemical change is a process where one or more substances are altered into one or more new and different substances. In the case of milk going sour, bacteria convert lactose into lactic acid, changing the substance's composition. Similarly, when roasting a marshmallow, the heat causes the sugars to caramelize and changes the marshmallow's composition. Thus, the correct answer is 'Both are chemical changes.'"

The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

The correct title is Step by Wicked Step."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct option is ""Step by Wicked Step"" because in English grammar, it is standard to capitalize the first and last words, as well as any major words in a title.

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 50Â°C pot of spaghetti sauce is colder than the 60Â°C pot of spaghetti sauce, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to temperature. The higher the temperature of an object, the more thermal energy it contains. Thus, between the two pots of spaghetti sauce, the one at 50Â°C has less thermal energy than the one at 60Â°C, because it's at a lower temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is 0."

Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Grandma Mia is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter is ""Dear Grandma Mia,"" because in English grammar, proper nouns should always be capitalized. The first word ""Dear"" is indeed capitalized and it does end with a comma which is correct. However, in the first choice ""mia"" is not capitalized, which is incorrect as it is part of a proper noun. Thus, the correct choice is the second one."

The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. The strength of magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets. The closer the magnets are to each other, the stronger the magnetic force between them. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. This is why I chose this answer."

Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Edward lives in a town with hot summers and freezing cold winters.
This passage tells you about the usual temperatures where Edward lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage describes the typical weather patterns of Edward's town throughout different seasons, which is a description of climate, not weather. While weather refers to the immediate atmospheric conditions, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a specific place. Therefore, the correct answer is climate (1)."

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.
The first text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). Julian's mouth may be in pain, but it is not actually on fire.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian's mouth was literally on fire by the time he finished his meal.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The second text uses the word 'literally' in its traditional sense, which means in a factual or exact manner. Julian did indeed consume three glasses of milk to alleviate the spiciness, which can be proven and is not exaggerated. The first text uses 'literally' figuratively, suggesting that Julian's mouth was on fire. However, this is not possible and is an exaggeration, hence not the traditional use of 'literally'."

It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Dolerite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, dolerite is not a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Dolerite is not a mineral because it does not have a fixed crystal structure, which is a requirement for a substance to be classified as a mineral. Although dolerite is found in nature, is solid, and is not made by living things, it is not a pure substance. Therefore, the correct answer is no, dolerite is not a mineral."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

"Without the mentioned diagram, it is impossible to definitively answer this question. However, based on the provided solution, we can infer that the answer would be (0) Solution A. 

SOLUTION: The explanation states that Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter, implying that it has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task requires understanding the relationship between the size of magnets and the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Given that all magnets are made of the same material, their size becomes the determining factor for the force magnitude. As explained in the solution, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1 because Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2. Therefore, the correct answer is option 2."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The problem states that the particles in sample B have a higher average speed and mass than the particles in sample A, indicating that they have more kinetic energy. Since temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of particles, the sample with higher average kinetic energy will have a higher temperature. Therefore, sample B has a higher temperature."

SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the alphabetical order of words and how they are arranged in a dictionary. Guide words on a dictionary page provide a clue about the range of words that can be found on that page. Since 'slippery' alphabetically falls between 'shy' and 'spool', it would be the word on a dictionary page with these guide words.

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Toriel's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Toriel's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Toriel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Toriel's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Toriel's genotype is homozygous dominant (LL), which means she carries two copies of the dominant allele for the coat color gene. In this case, the dominant allele (L) codes for a black coat. Therefore, Toriel's phenotype, or observable trait, is a black coat. This is because a dominant allele will mask the expression of a recessive allele, and in this case, the recessive allele codes for a reddish-brown coat."

A giraffe is a mammal. It has hair and feeds its young milk."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A coral snake is considered a reptile because it has scaly, waterproof skin and can live on land, as defined in the hint. On the other hand, a giraffe is a mammal, not a reptile, as it has hair and feeds its young milk. Therefore, the correct choice is the coral snake."

SOLUTION: The question asks to select the vertebrate. A vertebrate is an animal that has a backbone. The choices are a pig and a grasshopper. A pig is a mammal, and all mammals are vertebrates because they possess a backbone. Hence, the pig is the correct answer. A grasshopper, being an insect, does not have a backbone and is therefore an invertebrate."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
a copper statue turning green
baking an apple pie"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (1)
SOLUTION: Both a copper statue turning green and baking an apple pie are examples of chemical changes. In both instances, the original material undergoes a reaction that changes its composition. The copper reacts with oxygen to form copper oxide, and the baking process changes the properties of the pie ingredients. Thus, the answer is (1) Both are chemical changes."

['ginkgo leaf', 'wood']	1	This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Fossils	Compare ages of fossils in a rock sequence	"A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The wood fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the ginkgo leaf fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely older than the ginkgo leaf fossil."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The wood fossil is most likely the older fossil based on its position in the rock sequence diagram. The principle of superposition in geology states that in undisturbed layers of rock, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest at the top. Since the wood fossil is in a deeper layer than the ginkgo leaf fossil, it is older."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the basic principles of magnetism. In this scenario, the north pole of one magnet is near the south pole of the other which means these magnets will attract each other. This is because, in magnetism, opposite poles (north and south) attract each other. Therefore, the answer is 1, which signifies 'attract'."

	"Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
From across the room, Uncle Ronald's laughter was booming thunder."	['simile', 'metaphor']	1		closed choice	grade5	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"From across the room, Uncle Ronald's laughter was booming thunder.
The words laughter and thunder are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""From across the room, Uncle Ronald's laughter was booming thunder"" uses a metaphor. This is clear because the laughter is directly equated to ""booming thunder"" without using comparative words such as 'like' or 'as'. Therefore, it is a metaphor as it represents one thing as being the same as another thing for dramatic effect."
	Select the liquid.	['ballet shoes', 'hammer', 'wet paint', 'ring']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A ring is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A ring keeps its shape, even when you take it off your finger.
A ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.
A hammer is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A hammer is made of iron and wood. Both iron and wood are solids.
Wet paint is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour wet paint out of a can, the paint will change shape. But the wet paint will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The answer is 2 because wet paint is a liquid. Unlike solid items like a ring, ballet shoes, and a hammer, a liquid can change its shape to fit any container it's put in. This is why when you pour wet paint out of a can, it changes its shape. Hence, among the given options, wet paint is the liquid."

SOLUTION: The verbal irony in this text is Bobby's statement saying the cap fits Paula well, even though it's clearly too big as it keeps falling over her eyes. This is ironic because he is saying the opposite of what is really happening. Thus, the irony suggests that the cap was too big, not that it was a good fit. Hence, the correct answer is 1."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
mixing sand and water"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	1		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both 'erosion caused by wind' and 'mixing sand and water' are physical changes, not chemical changes. In both scenarios, the composition of the substances involved does not change, only their form or state does. Hence, neither heating nor cooling is involved, ruling out the other choices. Therefore, the answer is 'Both are only physical changes'."

A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

"Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a secondary consumer, so the copepod is a tertiary consumer.
The rotifer has arrows pointing to it from the green algae and the water flea. Neither the green algae nor the water flea is a secondary consumer, so the rotifer is not a tertiary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the rotifer and the shiner. The rotifer and the shiner are secondary consumers, so the black crappie is a tertiary consumer.
The green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a tertiary consumer."	"ANSWER: (0) 

SOLUTION: The copepod is the tertiary consumer in this food web. This is because it is being eaten by the rotifer, which is a secondary consumer. As the arrow in the food web points from the rotifer to the copepod, it indicates that the copepod is a step above in the food chain and, therefore, a tertiary consumer.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Ecological interactions	Classify symbiotic relationships	"When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.
This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.
Type of symbiotic relationship | Organism of one species... | Organism of the other species...
Commensal | benefits | is not significantly affected
Mutualistic | benefits | benefits
Parasitic | benefits | is harmed (but not usually killed)"	"When a megabat eats a fig, the megabat gets the food it needs to survive and grow. So the megabat benefits from its relationship with the fig tree.
Both the fig tree and its seeds have a better chance of surviving when the bat moves the seeds to a new location. So, the fig tree also benefits from its relationship with the megabat.
Since both the megabat and the fig tree benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The relationship between the megabat and the fig tree is mutualistic because both species benefit.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope and the staple get new shapes. Both are still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0 
SOLUTION: The act of stapling an envelope shut is considered a physical change because it involves altering the shape or form of the envelope without changing its fundamental chemical structure. This means that no new substances are created in the process, and that the change can be reversed by simply removing the staple. Therefore, the answer is a physical change."

['physical change', 'chemical change']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Mixing eggs, oil, and vinegar to make mayonnaise is a physical change. Mayonnaise is a mixture. Making a mixture does not form a different type of matter. The eggs, oil, and vinegar look different when they are mixed together. But, their molecules do not change.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The mixing of eggs, oil, and vinegar to make mayonnaise is a physical change because the original substances (eggs, oil, vinegar) retain their properties and can be separated again. The change in form and appearance does not involve any changes at the molecular level. Therefore, it is not a chemical change, which would involve a new substance being formed with different properties."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The statement ""The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1"" is correct. This is because the magnetic force between two magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than in Pair 2, the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1."

When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: With the closure of four men's clothing stores on Main Street, the number of suppliers of men's shirts in Milford decreased. This suggests that there are fewer places to purchase men's shirts, indicating a drop in supply. Thus, the supply of men's shirts has probably gone down."

Emmett rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Kinetic and potential energy	Identify changes in gravitational potential energy	"Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Emmett rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Emmett rode up the hill."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The gravitational potential energy of an object is directly related to its height above the ground. Therefore, as Emmett rides his motorcycle up the hill, the height of the motorcycle from the ground increases. This increase in height results in an increase in the gravitational potential energy between the motorcycle and the Earth. Hence, the correct answer is 1 indicating that the gravitational potential energy increased."

In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white body (b) is recessive to the allele for a brown body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two Channel catfish."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a white body or a brown body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a white body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a brown body.
A white body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a white body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A brown body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a brown body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a white body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a brown body."	"ANSWER: (2) 0:4
SOLUTION: The Punnett square shows that the expected offspring will all carry either BB or Bb genotype, which all result in brown bodies due to dominance. The white body is a recessive trait, represented by bb, and since there are no boxes in the Punnett square with this genotype, no offspring with a white body are expected. Hence, the expected ratio of white to brown bodies is 0:4."

Edgar's '64 Impala groaned describes the car as if it were human."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text uses the figure of speech called personification. This is evident when the '64 Impala, a car, is described as ""groaning"". Groaning is a human characteristic, typically indicating discomfort or effort, and cars do not literally groan.

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each beluga whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One beluga whale moved 20 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other beluga whale moved 30 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each beluga whale spent the same amount of time moving. The beluga whale that moved 20 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that beluga whale must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance it travelled by the time it took. If two objects are moving for the same amount of time, the object that covers less distance is moving at a slower speed. In this case, the beluga whale that moved 20 kilometers in 5 hours has covered less distance than the one that moved 30 kilometers, so it is moving at a lower speed."

It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.

['push', 'pull']	1	An uncle plays with his nieces on the beach. He applies a force to the rope on their sled. The sled slides along behind him.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Identify pushes and pulls	"A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The uncle applies a force to the rope on the sled. The sled slides along behind him. The direction of this force is toward the uncle. This force is a pull.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The uncle is moving the sled by applying a force to the rope which is attached to the sled. The sled is moving in the direction of the force applied, which is towards the uncle. Hence, the force applied by the uncle is a ""pull"" force and not a ""push"" force. This is why the correct answer is 1, which represents a ""pull"" force."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task requires an understanding of the basic principles of magnetism. It is a well-known fact that like poles of magnets (north-north or south-south) repel each other while unlike poles (north-south or south-north) attract each other. In this case, the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other, meaning they are like poles. Therefore, they will repel each other."

['the Indian Ocean', 'the Arctic Ocean', 'the Pacific Ocean']	1		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0Â° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180Â°E and 180Â°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0Â° longitude. It intersects the Arctic Ocean. It does not intersect the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.	"ANSWER: (1)
SOLUTION: The Prime Meridian, also known as the Greenwich Meridian, is the imaginary line drawn from the North Pole to the South Pole passing through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London. It is at 0Â° longitude. The Arctic Ocean is intersected by this line. It does not cross the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, which makes choice (1) the Arctic Ocean the correct answer."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	All three cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 87Â°F pie is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy.	"ANSWER: (2)
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature. The higher the temperature of the object, the higher its thermal energy. In this case, all three cherry pies are identical except for their temperature. Therefore, the cherry pie with the highest temperature, which is 87Â°F, has the most thermal energy."

Since spray is between the guide words slush - star, it would be found on that page."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the alphabetical order of words as they appear in dictionaries. Guide words, which are at the top of each dictionary page, help to identify which words fall on that page. The word 'spray' falls between 'slush' and 'star' when arranged in alphabetical order, hence it can be found on that page. The word 'seventh' does not fit between these guide words, so the correct answer is 'spray' (1)."

The volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury."	['true', 'false']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is greater than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury."	"ANSWER: (0) true
SOLUTION: The volume of Earth is indeed more than ten times the volume of Mercury. As per the given data, the volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, and ten times the volume of Mercury is 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. When compared, it is clear that Earth's volume is significantly larger, hence the statement is true."

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The mammal tooth fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the wood fossil. So, the mammal tooth fossil is most likely younger than the wood fossil."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The mammal tooth fossil is younger based on the principle of superposition in geology, which states that in undisturbed sedimentary rock layers, the oldest layer is on the bottom and the layers get progressively younger moving up. Since the mammal tooth fossil is in a shallower layer than the wood fossil, it is younger according to this principle."

The statement above is an opinion. People can have different ideas about what makes someone a ""better"" leader, so the statement cannot be proved."	"The first sentence states a fact.
Certain insects help flowering plants reproduce by moving pollen between the plant's different parts.
It can be proved by reading an article about how flowering plants are pollinated.
The second sentence states an opinion.
Tomato plants, with their bright colors and sturdy vines, make attractive additions to home gardens.
Attractive shows what a person believes, thinks, or feels. Another person might have a different opinion about which plants make home gardens attractive."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Certain insects help flowering plants reproduce by moving pollen between the plant's different parts"" states a fact because it describes a scientifically proven process called pollination. This is a process that can be objectively observed and tested, making it a fact. On the other hand, the sentence about tomato plants is subjective and might vary from person to person, therefore it is considered an opinion, not a fact."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the average kinetic energies of particles in two gas samples. The hint and solution provide the required information. Each particle in sample A has more mass, resulting in a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B. Therefore, sample A has a higher temperature. So, the answer is 2, which corresponds to sample A."

['a mature fern', 'a heart-shaped plant']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	"A heart-shaped plant can produce eggs and sperm.
A mature fern produces spores, not eggs and sperm."	"ANSWER: (0) a mature fern
SOLUTION: According to the hint, the life cycle of a fern is being discussed. In a fern's life cycle, the mature fern plant produces spores, which eventually grow into a heart-shaped gametophyte. This gametophyte is the plant that produces eggs and sperm. Therefore, the correct answer is a mature fern (0), as it is a part of the fern's life cycle that leads to the production of eggs and sperm."

It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
â€”From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
â€”From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
â€”From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
â€”From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel

SOLUTION: The first poem, ""The Crooked Sixpence"" from Mother Goose, is the one that uses repetition. The word 'crooked' is repeatedly used to describe various elements such as the man, mile, sixpence, stile, cat, mouse, and house. This repetition creates a rhythmic pattern and emphasizes the key theme of the poem. The second poem, ""Frost at Midnight"" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, doesn't show any clear repetition of words, phrases, or lines."

Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, bromomethane is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Bromomethane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The model provided shows that bromomethane is made up of three different chemical elements - carbon, hydrogen, and bromine, which are bonded together.

['the flowers', 'the fruit']	0	This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Angiosperm and conifer life cycles	"Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again."	"An apple tree's flowers can make seeds. Inside a flower, a sperm cell and an egg fuse to make a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg grows into a seed.

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes (E). So, Bianca's genotype for the eye color gene is EE.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task provides information about a guinea pig named Bianca who has brown eyes. Since the allele E is for brown eyes and Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes, her genotype is EE.

The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The marmot has large front teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The marmot uses its mouth to gnaw on plant matter."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The tiger is the correct answer because, as stated in the text, it has a large mouth and sharp teeth which are adaptations to tear through meat. This is similar to the Eurasian lynx whose mouth is also adapted to tear through meat. On the other hand, the marmot, which is primarily a herbivore, uses its large front teeth to gnaw on plant matter, not to tear through meat.

"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy."	The two soccer balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder soccer ball has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Complete the sentence with the phrase more obedient. It describes the clay as if it were a person who can choose to obey or disobey.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ""more obedient"". This is because personification is a figure of speech where human qualities are given to non-human entities. In this case, obedience is a human trait that is being assigned to the clay, hence it is a personification. The option ""softer"" does not personify the clay because softness is not a human quality."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
crushing a mineral into powder
knitting yarn into a scarf"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both actions, crushing a mineral into powder and knitting yarn into a scarf, cause a change in form but not in the substance itself. This indicates that they are physical changes, not chemical ones, because the substance's identity remains the same. Both changes are not caused by heating or cooling, ruling out the other options.

	Which pencil has a lower temperature?	['the pencil with more thermal energy', 'the pencil with less thermal energy']	1	Two pencils are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two pencils are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the pencil with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The temperature of an object is directly related to its thermal energy. The more thermal energy an object has, the higher its temperature, because the thermal energy is related to the movement of the particles in the object.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.

Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, ammonia is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The chemical formula for ammonia is NH3, which consists of nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H) elements. Since it is composed of more than one type of element, it cannot be an elementary substance. An elementary substance is composed of only one type of atom. Hence, ammonia, being made up of two different elements, is a compound. Therefore, the answer is 0, which corresponds to ""a compound""."

The allele for white wool (L) is dominant over the allele for black wool (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black wool or white wool, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for white wool, is dominant over the l allele, which is for black wool.
Black wool is the recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the wool color trait must have only recessive alleles for the wool color gene. So, offspring with black wool must have the genotype ll.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ll.
White wool is the dominant allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the wool color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wool color gene. So, offspring with white wool must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black wool. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with white wool."	"ANSWER: (2) 4:0
SOLUTION: The Punnett square shows that all offspring will possess the genotype 'll' which corresponds to black wool according to the given information. Since the white wool trait is dominant, it requires at least one 'L' allele, which is absent in all offspring. Therefore, the ratio of black wool to white wool in the offspring will be 4:0."

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom.

Since chloromethane is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, chloromethane is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The chemical formula for chloromethane is CH3Cl, which indicates that it is composed of multiple elements - Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), and Chlorine (Cl). Elementary substances are composed of a single type of atom, while compounds are composed of two or more types of atoms chemically bonded together.

Figure: sea turtle."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: feet and limbs	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
Arms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly."	"Look at the picture of the sea turtle.
The sea turtle uses its flippers to push itself through water. The flippers can also help it change direction while swimming.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The California sea lion has flippers. Its limbs are adapted for swimming.
The flying fox has large wings and short legs. Its limbs are not adapted for swimming. The flying fox uses its limbs to fly and hang from trees."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The California sea lion has flippers which are limbs adapted for swimming, similar to the sea turtle's in the hint. This adaptation allows it to move effectively in water. On the other hand, the flying fox's limbs are adapted for flight and not swimming, thus making the California sea lion the animal with limbs adapted for swimming."

made in a chocolate factory
not a pure substance
no fixed crystal structure"	yes or no	grade5	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Chocolate does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, chocolate is not a mineral.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A mineral is a naturally occurring, inorganic solid with a defined chemical composition and a crystalline structure. Chocolate, despite being a solid, is not a naturally occurring substance. It is made in a factory, and it does not have a fixed crystalline structure. Therefore, it does not fulfil the necessary criteria to be classified as a mineral."
	Which kind of place usually has quieter neighborhoods?	['an urban area', 'a suburban area']	1		closed choice	grade2	social science	geography	Geography	Compare urban, suburban, and rural areas	"People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb."	Suburban areas usually have quieter neighborhoods. There are fewer people, and houses are farther apart.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Suburban areas typically have quieter neighborhoods as compared to urban areas. This is due to a number of factors including less population density, fewer commercial establishments, and more distance between residences. Moreover, suburban areas often have more nature and green spaces, which can contribute to a quieter environment. Therefore, the correct choice is 1, a suburban area."
	Which is a compound sentence?

A windmill is not a living thing.
A windmill does not have all the traits of a living thing. It moves in the wind, but it does not grow. It does not need food or water."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The answer is ""lion"" because a lion displays all the main characteristics of a living organism. Lions grow, need sustenance in the form of food and water, and respond to their environment. On the other hand, a windmill, paper clip, and brick wall are all non-living things as they do not exhibit these characteristics."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
crushing a mineral into powder
pouring milk on oatmeal"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Crushing a mineral into a powder and pouring milk on oatmeal are both physical changes. This is because the substances involved retain their original properties and do not form new substances. Neither change is caused by heating or cooling, and neither change is a chemical change. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Both are only physical changes""."
	Which object has more thermal energy?

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two rocks have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 95Â°F rock is hotter than the 20Â°F rock, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature of an object, the more thermal energy it possesses. In this case, the two rocks have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the rock at 95Â°F is hotter than the rock at 20Â°F, it has more thermal energy. Therefore, the answer is option 0, the 750-gram rock at a temperature of 95Â°F."
	Which drop of honey has more thermal energy?	['the hotter drop of honey', 'the colder drop of honey']	0	Two drops of honey are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter drop of honey has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is the total of all the kinetic energy due to the motion of molecules in an object. It depends on the temperature, mass and type of particles in an object. In this case, both drops of honey are identical in mass and type of particles. Therefore, the difference in thermal energy is solely based on temperature. As temperature increases, the thermal energy also increases. Hence, the hotter drop of honey has more thermal energy."

SOLUTION: The blue-footed booby is the correct answer as it is a bird, which is the requirement of the question. The other options, cobra, salmon, and bison, refer to a reptile, a fish, and a mammal respectively. Birds are characterized by their feathers, beaks, and ability to fly, characteristics which are exhibited by the blue-footed booby."
	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Cara has naturally brown hair."	['inherited', 'acquired']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	"Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Some people dye their hair. But this does not change their natural hair color.
Children get their natural hair color from their parents. So, Cara's hair color is an inherited trait."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Natural hair color is determined by genetics, which are passed down from parents to their offspring. This means that Cara's brown hair is an inherited trait, not something she has acquired during her lifetime. Acquired traits are those that are learned or developed due to environmental influences, which is not the case for natural hair color."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B. The average kinetic energy of a gas is directly proportional to its temperature. If the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is higher, then the temperature of sample A will also be higher. Therefore, sample A has the higher temperature."

Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Hakim, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Hakim down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Hakim up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The problem statement clearly mentions that all the forces on Hakim are balanced. This is further evidenced in the hint where the force of gravity pulling Hakim downwards is equal to the force of the diving board pushing him upwards. Both forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction, cancelling each other out. Therefore, there is no net force acting on Hakim, which leads to the conclusion that the forces are balanced."

Different objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Grouping objects by their properties is called classification."	"Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
Sugar has a sweet taste. The trombone is not sweet.
A shiny object reflects a lot of light. You can usually see your reflection in a shiny object. All four objects are shiny.
You can see clearly through a transparent object. None of the objects are transparent.
The property that all four objects have in common is shiny."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The explanation provided clearly states that all four objects are shiny, thus the common property is that they are shiny. The other properties - sweet and transparent - are not common to all objects as the trombone is not sweet and none of the objects are transparent. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 - shiny."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The solution hints that the size of the magnets affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. If magnets are of the same material and shape, the smaller the magnet, the smaller the magnetic force. In this case, Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. Hence, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is smaller than in Pair 2. Therefore, the correct answer is 2."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

Others are born with naturally straight hair.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	"Human hair can be naturally curly or naturally straight. Curly and straight are examples of hair texture.
Some people decide to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally curly hair is an inherited trait."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task asks whether Polly's naturally curly hair is an inherited or acquired trait. Considering the hint and the solution provided, it is clear that hair texture, in this case, curly hair, is a trait that individuals are born with. It is not something that can be acquired or changed naturally over time. Therefore, Polly's naturally curly hair is an inherited trait."
	Based on this information, what is Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait?	['a hairy fleece', 'a woolly fleece']	0	"This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
Sage is a sheep from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype FF for the fleece type gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Sage's genotype for the fleece type gene is FF. Sage's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for a hairy fleece. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Sage's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Sage's genotype for the fleece type trait is FF. Given that the F allele, which stands for a hairy fleece, is dominant, Sage will express this phenotype. Regardless of what the other allele could have been, the presence of a dominant allele guarantees the expression of that specific trait. Therefore, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece."

However, even though his company is perceived as fiscally irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Tyler is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text implies that because Tyler works for a company that has filed for bankruptcy, he can't be trusted with money. This is an example of the guilt by association fallacy because it unfairly associates Tyler's trustworthiness with the financial status of his employer. The financial situation of the company does not necessarily reflect on Tyler's personal financial responsibility or trustworthiness."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian.

Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in past tense. You can tell because it uses a past-tense verb, explained. The verb ends in -ed and tells you about something that has already happened.	"ANSWER: (2) past tense
SOLUTION: The answer is past tense because the verb in the sentence ""explained"" is in the past tense. This is determined by the ""-ed"" ending of the verb, which usually indicates that an action has already taken place. Therefore, the events described in the sentence happened in the past."
	Is a necklace a good or a service?	['a service', 'a good']	1		closed choice	grade2	social science	economics	Economics	Goods and services	"Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.
A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether a necklace is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a necklace something you can touch? Yes.
Is a necklace a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a necklace is a good."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A necklace is a good because it is a tangible item that one can physically touch and possess. It is a product that you can purchase and own, not a service that is performed for you. Therefore, a necklace falls under the category of goods rather than services."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
"	The text argues that Edgar can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Edgar can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text implies that Edgar should not be trusted as a treasurer because his uncle was involved in a financial crime. It is trying to discredit Edgar based on his association with his uncle, rather than his own actions or capabilities. Therefore, this is an example of the 'guilt by association' fallacy, making option 1 the correct answer."

Lithium bromide is used to absorb moisture from the air.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.

17 cups and 17 gallons are both too much."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: A water balloon is typically small enough to hold in one hand, so it wouldn't be able to contain 17 cups or 17 gallons of water as these quantities are too large. 17 fluid ounces, on the other hand, is a more reasonable estimate. This is roughly equivalent to a little over 2 cups, a volume that a typical water balloon could feasibly hold."

It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.

A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure.

"Without the diagram of the solutions, it's impossible to provide an exact answer as the text refers to a visual aid. However, the solution text indicates that ""Solution B has more pink particles per milliliter."" Therefore, the answer would be (1) Solution B.

SOLUTION: The concentration is determined by the number of solute particles (in this case, pink particles) per unit volume of the solvent.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But pouring milk on oatmeal is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (3)
SOLUTION: Pouring milk on oatmeal and water evaporating from a puddle are both physical changes because they do not result in a new kind of matter being created. In the case of the oatmeal and milk, they merely mix together, while in the case of the evaporating water, it simply changes from a liquid state to a gas state. Neither of these changes are caused by heating or cooling, and they are not chemical changes. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes."

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Ecological interactions	Interpret food webs II	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the sea cucumber.There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the sea cucumber: kelp->sea urchin->sea otter->orca->sea cucumber. black rockfish. The only arrow pointing from the black rockfish leads to the kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the black rockfish to the sea cucumber.. kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.. bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bat star to the sea cucumber..	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The kelp is the only organism in the given options that has a direct path to the sea cucumber, as the matter flows from the kelp to the sea urchin, then to the sea otter, then to the orca, and finally to the sea cucumber. The remaining options, i.e., the bat star, the kelp bass, and the black rockfish, don't have a direct or indirect path leading to the sea cucumber, making them invalid options."

This table shows how the temperature of each salmon changed over 6minutes.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	Compare thermal energy transfers	"A change in an object's temperature indicates a change in the object's thermal energy:
An increase in temperature shows that the object's thermal energy increased. So, thermal energy was transferred into the object from its surroundings.
A decrease in temperature shows that the object's thermal energy decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred out of the object to its surroundings."	The temperature of each salmon increased, which means that the thermal energy of each salmon increased. So, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each salmon.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding how heat transfer occurs. In this case, the charcoal grill is hotter than the salmon initially, and hence, thermal energy is transferred from the grill (the surroundings) to the salmon. This is confirmed by the increase in temperature of the salmon, indicating that they gained thermal energy. Thus, thermal energy was transferred from the surroundings to each salmon."

['Greek mythology', 'modern history']	0		closed choice	grade12	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion chimerical is Greek mythology.
According to Greek mythology, a Chimera was an improbable fire-breathing monster with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.
The allusion chimerical means fanciful."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The term ""chimerical"" refers to something that is imagined or unreal, much like the mythical Chimera from Greek mythology. The Chimera was seen as a creature that was an impossible or fanciful combination of different animals. Therefore, when the artist's drawings are described as chimerical, it means they contain unreal or imaginary creatures, tying back to Greek mythology, not modern history."

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word travesty because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first text uses the word 'travesty' in its traditional sense, which refers to a false, absurd, or distorted representation of something. Walter's poorly researched essay is likened to a travesty because it inaccurately depicts the actual historical events of the Space Race. This is in contrast to the second text where 'travesty' is used to express disappointment or tragedy, which is a nontraditional use of the term."

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A Victoria crowned pigeon's scientific name is Goura victoria.
Dendrobates leucomelas does not have the same scientific name as a Victoria crowned pigeon. So, Goura victoria and Dendrobates leucomelas are not in the same species.
Aequorea victoria does have the same species within its genus as a Victoria crowned pigeon, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species.
Goura victoria has the same scientific name as a Victoria crowned pigeon. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The correct answer is Goura victoria because it has the same scientific name as the Victoria crowned pigeon, indicating they are of the same species. The other two options Dendrobates leucomelas and Aequorea victoria, although they contain 'victoria' in their names, they are not in the same species as Victoria crowned pigeon because their scientific names are different.

coarse-grained texture
no fixed crystal structure
solid

not made by organisms
not a pure substance"	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of syenite match the properties of a rock. So, syenite is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Syenite is a coarse-grained igneous rock that is not a pure substance and does not have a fixed crystal structure. These characteristics align with the properties of rocks. Additionally, syenite is naturally occurring and not made by organisms, which further supports that it is a rock, not a mineral."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

In a chemical reaction, one or more substances change into one or more different substances. During the reaction, the atoms of the original substances are rearranged to form other substances.
The original substances in a chemical reaction are called reactants. These substances react, or go through a chemical change.
The substances that are formed in a chemical reaction are called products. These substances are produced by the chemical reaction.
So, in a chemical reaction, reactants go through a chemical change to form products."	"Read the underlined text carefully. Look for information about what happens to carbon monoxide in this chemical reaction.
Ozone is a gas found high up in Earth's atmosphere. In places with severe air pollution, ozone can also be found in the air closer to the ground. This ground-level ozone forms when oxygen in the air combines with carbon monoxide and other chemicals in polluted air. Ground-level ozone can harm humans by damaging their lungs.
The underlined text tells you that when oxygen and carbon monoxide combine, ozone is formed. When oxygen and carbon monoxide react, or go through a chemical change, their atoms are rearranged to form ozone. Because carbon monoxide reacts in this chemical reaction, carbon monoxide is a reactant."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text provided indicates that carbon monoxide is one of the substances that combine to form ozone in the chemical reaction described. This means that carbon monoxide is not a result of the reaction, but one of its starting materials. In chemical terms, substances that are used up or transformed in a reaction are called reactants. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, ""reactant""."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two blocks of steel have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 65Â°F block is colder than the 110Â°F block, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly proportional to temperature, so a higher temperature indicates more thermal energy. In this case, we're comparing two blocks of steel with the same mass but different temperatures. The block at 65Â°F is cooler than the one at 110Â°F, so it has less thermal energy."

<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=104x177 at 0x313C6D670>	Is a watch a solid, a liquid, or a gas?	['a solid', 'a liquid', 'a gas']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"A watch is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A watch can bend to fit your wrist, but the watch will still have its own shape."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A watch is a solid because it maintains a fixed volume and shape. Solids have particles that are closely packed together and can only vibrate in place, which gives them their rigid structure. Although some parts of a watch, such as its strap, may be flexible, this doesn't alter the fact that they are still solid materials."

Malik can fly an airplane."	['inherited', 'acquired']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to fly an airplane. Instead, some people learn how to fly airplanes. So, flying an airplane is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1

The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Casanova is history.
The autobiography of Giovanni Giacomo Casanova, an eighteenth-century Italian adventurer, details and perhaps exaggerates his amorous adventures and success with women.
The allusion Casanova means a womanizer."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The allusion 'Casanova' in the sentence originates from history. Casanova was a real person, Giovanni Giacomo Casanova, who was known for his romantic escapades in the 18th-century Italy. His name has since been used to refer to men who are promiscuous or known for their romantic successes. Therefore, the reference to Casanova is a historical allusion, not one from Greek mythology."

Some words are close in meaning but have different connotations.
For example, think about the words eager and impatient. They both mean wanting something to happen, but they have different connotations.
Eager has a positive connotation. It is a nice word. An eager person is happy and excited.
Impatient has a negative connotation. It is not a nice word. An impatient person is often pushy and demanding."	An eager person has a more positive connotation. An eager person is excited and happy. An impatient person is often rude, pushy, or demanding.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The term 'eager' is generally seen as a positive trait as it suggests enthusiasm, willingness, and a proactive approach towards tasks or situations. On the other hand, 'impatient' usually has negative connotations as it implies a lack of self-control, restlessness, or intolerance towards delay or opposition. Therefore, 'an eager person' has a more positive connotation."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each car moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each car moved for 10 hours. The car that moved 240 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took to travel that distance. All three cars traveled for the same duration - 10 hours. Therefore, the car which covered the least distance would have the lowest speed. In this case, the car that moved 240 kilometers in 10 hours is moving at the lowest speed. Hence, option 2 is the correct answer."

The cell membrane also protects the cell from the outside environment.
The cytoplasm is made up of a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell membrane. The cytoplasm supports the other cell parts and holds them in place. Many important chemical reactions happen in the cytoplasm.
The mitochondria break down sugar to release energy that the cell can use.
The vacuoles store nutrients, such as sugar, in the cell. Vacuoles also store water and waste.
The nucleus directs cell activities. It does this by sending instructions to different parts of the cell.
The chromosomes contain the information that the cell uses for growth and activities. In animal and plant cells, the chromosomes are inside the nucleus."	Vacuoles store water, waste, and nutrients such as sugar. Animal cells usually have several small vacuoles.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Vacuoles are the correct answer because they are responsible for storing various substances inside the cell, like nutrients, water, and waste materials. This role is essential for maintaining the cell's internal environment and ensuring its proper functioning. Mitochondria, on the other hand, are involved in energy production, and the cytoplasm is the fluid that fills a cell and contains all organelles and cell parts. Therefore, the function of vacuoles aligns with the task's question."

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	In this experiment, Jeanette and Bryant investigated whether adding wax to snowboards affects their speed. There was no wax on the snowboards with wax removed. So, they were part of a control group.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The control group in an experiment is the one where no experiment is performed and is used for comparison. In this case, the snowboards with the wax removed served as the control group. This is because no wax was applied to them, so they provide a basis for comparison to understand the impact of the wax on the speed of the snowboards."

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.
They use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce."	"This organism is photosynthetic:

This organism is not photosynthetic:
The text does not provide evidence that the crown-of-thorns starfish is photosynthetic."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The barrel cactus is described as a producer that uses energy from the sunlight to make its own food. This is a key characteristic of photosynthetic organisms, which are capable of using sunlight to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, a type of food for the plant. On the other hand, the crown-of-thorns starfish is described as a consumer, meaning it eats other organisms for food and does not perform photosynthesis.

	Which empty mug has a higher temperature?	['the empty mug with more thermal energy', 'the empty mug with less thermal energy']	0	Two empty mugs are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two empty mugs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the empty mug with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The empty mug with more thermal energy has a higher temperature. This is because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, which is directly related to thermal energy. Therefore, if a mug has more thermal energy, it means its particles have more kinetic energy on average, and thus it has a higher temperature.

Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A marbled salamander's scientific name is Ambystoma opacum.
Ambystoma opacum has the same scientific name as a marbled salamander. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Lissotriton helveticus does not have the same scientific name as a marbled salamander. So, Ambystoma opacum and Lissotriton helveticus are not in the same species.
Taricha torosa does not have the same scientific name as a marbled salamander. So, Ambystoma opacum and Taricha torosa are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The scientific name for the marbled salamander is Ambystoma opacum. Therefore, any organism with the same scientific name would be in the same species. Out of the given choices, only option 2, Ambystoma opacum, matches the scientific name of the marbled salamander. Hence, option 2 is the correct answer."
	"Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Mrs. Shelton is kind, and her heart is gold."	['metaphor', 'simile']	0		closed choice	grade4	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"Mrs. Shelton is kind, and her heart is gold.
The words heart and gold are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The given sentence, ""Mrs. Shelton is kind, and her heart is gold."" uses a metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares one thing to another for rhetorical effect. Here, Mrs. Shelton's heart is directly compared to gold, symbolizing its preciousness and purity. There is no usage of 'like' or 'as', which are typically used in similes, thus this is not a simile."

A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it."	"Flexible is a property. A flexible material can be bent without breaking easily.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine bending the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the metal hair clip is the most flexible. If you gently bend a metal hairclip, it will not break."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The metal hair clip is the most flexible among the given choices. This is because metal, especially the type used in hair clips, can be bent back and forth without breaking. In comparison, a wood board and a glass bowl are rigid and can break or crack if force is applied to bend them. Thus, the metal hair clip is the most flexible option."

The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground."	"Look at the picture of the snow leopard.
The snow leopard has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice. The fur can help keep the snow leopard's feet warm. The large pads help spread its weight over a larger area. This allows it to walk on ice without slipping and to walk on snow without sinking in too deep.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Siberian tiger has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice.
The tokay gecko has wide, sticky toes. Its feet are not adapted to walk on snow and ice. The tokay gecko uses its feet to climb trees and walk on leaves."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the Siberian tiger, like the snow leopard, has furry feet with large pads. These adaptations help the tiger walk on snow and ice without slipping or sinking too deep, similar to the snow leopard. On the other hand, the tokay gecko's feet are adapted for climbing trees and walking on leaves, not for walking on snow and ice."

Echo, a cow from this group, has a red coat. Echo has two alleles for a red coat."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the coat color trait is a red coat. So, Echo's phenotype for the coat color trait is a red coat.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phenotype refers to the observable characteristics of an organism that are determined by its genes. In the given information, it is clearly mentioned that Echo, a cow, has a red coat. Thus, its observable characteristic, or phenotype, for the coat color trait is a red coat. Therefore, the correct choice is option 0, which states ""a red coat""."

A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	"ANSWER: (1) false
SOLUTION: The statement is false because when you calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars, you get a number that is more than the volume of Jupiter. The volume of Jupiter is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, while the volume of Mars multiplied by 10,000 results in a number greater than Jupiter's volume. Therefore, Jupiter's volume is not more than 10,000 times the volume of Mars."

There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task requires understanding of how the distance between magnets affects the magnetic force between them. Given that all magnets are made of the same material, the only factor that can affect the force is the distance. The hint specifies that the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than in Pair 1.

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The first text uses random in its traditional sense: made or occurring without a definite pattern.
At the grocery store, Martina hastily grabbed fruits and vegetables at random, filling her shopping cart with a hodgepodge of food.
The second text uses random in its nontraditional sense: odd or out of place.
Martina made a random trip to the grocery store, though her kitchen was already stocked with a hodgepodge of food.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word random because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The choice 1 uses the word 'random' in its traditional sense, which means 'without a definite pattern or plan'. Here, 'random' is used to describe how Martina is picking up the vegetables and fruits without any specific order or plan. On the other hand, choice 0 uses 'random' to describe an unexpected or odd event, which is a non-traditional use of the word. Therefore, choice 1 is the correct answer."
	How long is a garden rake?

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.
A football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long."	"The best estimate for the length of a garden rake is 6 feet.
6 inches is too short. 6 yards and 6 miles are too long."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The most suitable estimate for the length of a garden rake is 6 feet. A rake with a length of 6 inches would be too small and impractical for use. On the other hand, a rake that is 6 yards or 6 miles long would be excessively large, making it unwieldy and difficult to use for the purpose of raking a garden."

['acquired', 'inherited']	0	Hint: Riding a motorcycle well takes practice.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to ride a motorcycle. Instead, many people learn how to ride. So, riding a motorcycle is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Riding a motorcycle is a skill that one learns and develops through practice, not something one is born with. It doesn't involve genes or hereditary factors. Therefore, it is an acquired trait, not an inherited one. Acquired traits are characteristics or abilities that an individual develops over their lifetime, often due to environmental factors or experiences."

Since clutch is not between the guide words criticism - cultivate, it would not be found on that page."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task requires understanding of alphabetical order and how it relates to guide words in a dictionary. Guide words are the first and last words on a dictionary page, indicating the range of words within that page. The word 'clutch' falls alphabetically after 'criticism' but before 'cultivate', so it would not be found on a page with these guide words. Therefore, the answer is 'no'."
	How long does it take to bake lasagna in the oven?	['39 hours', '39 minutes']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to bake lasagna in the oven is 39 minutes.
39 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Typically, lasagna takes about 45 minutes to an hour to bake in the oven, depending on the recipe. Therefore, 39 minutes is a more reasonable estimate compared to 39 hours, which is excessively long for any standard baking process. This choice reflects a more realistic cooking time, aligning with common culinary practices."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The magnetic force is determined by the size of the magnets and not by whether they attract or repel. In the task, Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, but Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. This explains why the correct answer is 2."

Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
The book critic thought The Fault in Our Stars was well-written, but I didn't like the ending."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The second choice contains a vague pronoun reference. In the sentence, ""The book critic thought The Fault in Our Stars was well-written, but I didn't like the ending"", the pronoun 'it' is ambiguous. It could be referring to either ""The Fault in Our Stars"" or the ""ending"" of the book. This uncertainty leads to confusion, making the statement vague. The first choice, on the other hand, clearly refers 'it' to 'The Fault in Our Stars', making the pronoun reference clear."

"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The explanation provided clearly states that larger magnets have a greater magnitude of magnetic force. Since Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1, it follows that the magnetic force would also be greater in Pair 2. Therefore, the answer is 2, which states that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
carving a piece of wood
water boiling on a stove"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water boiling is caused by heating. But carving a piece of wood is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The two changes mentioned in the question are carving a piece of wood and water boiling on a stove. Both of these changes are physical changes as the matter remains the same after the change. Carving a piece of wood changes its shape but it is still wood, and boiling water changes its state from liquid to gas but it is still water. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes."

On the map, the ridge is shown in the Gulf of Aden, between the countries of Somalia and Yemen."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Plate tectonics	Describe tectonic plate boundaries around the world	"The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley."	"To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Aden Ridge, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Aden Ridge began to form millions of years ago as the Somalian Plate and the Arabian Plate moved away from each other. The plates are slowly moving apart at a rate of about 2 centimeters per year. On the map, the ridge is shown in the Gulf of Aden, between the countries of Somalia and Yemen.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Aden Ridge formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged. So, the Aden Ridge formed at a divergent boundary."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The Aden Ridge formed as a result of the Somalian Plate and the Arabian Plate moving apart from each other. This movement of tectonic plates away from each other is characteristic of a divergent boundary. Hence, the correct choice is 'divergent' which corresponds to option 1. This is confirmed by the information provided in the passage."

Kenneth, a human from this group, does not have Thomsen disease. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease (m). So, Kenneth's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm.	"ANSWER: 1

The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.

The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Edna started sledding. As Edna rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Edna rode down the hill."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The gravitational potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height from the ground. As Edna sleds down the hill, the height of the sled from the ground decreases, thus the gravitational potential energy between the sled and Earth also decreases.

	"Look at the word. Does it have a closed syllable or an open syllable?
help"	['closed', 'open']	0		closed choice	grade2	language science	word-study	Short and long vowels	Is the syllable open or closed?	"Words are made up of syllables. Two kinds of syllables are closed and open.
A closed syllable has one vowel and ends with a consonant. It usually has a short vowel sound.
desk: short e
kit / ten: short i / short e
An open syllable ends with one vowel. It usually has a long vowel sound.
go: long o
he / ro: long e / long o
Some open syllables end with y. The y makes a long e sound or a long i sound.
sky: long i
ba / by: long a / long e"	The word help ends with a consonant and has a short vowel sound. So, it has a closed syllable.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: In the English language, a closed syllable is one where a single vowel is followed by one or more consonants, which results in a short or 'closed' vowel sound. In the word ""help"", the vowel 'e' is followed by two consonants 'l' and 'p', creating a short vowel sound. Therefore, it falls under the category of a closed syllable."

The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The force of Earth's gravity pulls the hot water downward. The direction of the pull is toward the center of Earth.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the direction of Earth's gravitational pull. The hint states that the hot water is pulled downward by the force of Earth's gravity as it falls into the teacup. This implies that the pull is towards the center of the Earth. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 (toward the center of Earth)."
	How long is a soccer field?	['120 meters', '120 kilometers']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a soccer field is 120 meters.
120 kilometers is too long."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The more accurate estimate for the length of a soccer field is 120 meters. According to FIFA, the international governing body for soccer, the length of a soccer field should be between 100 and 110 meters. Hence, 120 meters is a closer approximation than 120 kilometers, which is significantly longer and not a realistic length for a soccer field."

The simile life was like a box of chocolates suggests that life is unpredictable. You don't know what type of filling is inside a chocolate until you try it, just as you don't know what life holds for you until it happens."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The simile ""life was like a box of chocolates"" suggests that life is unpredictable. This is because a box of chocolates usually contains different types of chocolates, and you can't tell what type each one is until you eat it. The same goes for life, as we can't predict what will happen next. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Life is unpredictable."" The option ""Life is luxurious"" doesn't fit because the simile doesn't make any reference to luxury or wealth."

"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Pedro lives in a town with hot summers and freezing cold winters.
This passage tells you about the usual temperatures where Pedro lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The passage describes the climate. It explains the typical weather patterns in Pedro's town over time, specifying hot summers and freezing cold winters. The weather would refer to the daily conditions, which is not mentioned in the passage. Hence, the passage is describing the climate, not the weather."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it could refer to the vinyl album or the record player.
Just as Mr. Tang was about to play the vinyl album on his old record player, it broke.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
The vinyl album broke just as Mr. Tang was about to play it on his old record player."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is option 1. This is because the pronoun 'it' is not clearly referring to a specific noun. It could either be referring to 'the vinyl album' or 'his old record player', causing ambiguity. Clear pronoun references are important to ensure the reader understands exactly what is being discussed. The first option does not have this issue as 'it' clearly refers to 'The vinyl album'."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The magnetic force between two magnets is inversely proportional to the distance between them. Therefore, when the distance is smaller, the force is greater. In this case, the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is smaller than the distance in Pair 1. Hence, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2, making choice 1 the correct answer."

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, cook. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: (2) future tense
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Uncle Danny will cook dinner for us"" is in the future tense. This is because it uses the auxiliary verb 'will' before the main verb 'cook', which indicates an action that will take place in the future. In English, 'will' is commonly used to form the future tense of verbs. Thus, the sentence talks about a future event where Uncle Danny is going to cook dinner."

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	Chalcopyrite has all the properties of a mineral. So, chalcopyrite is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1

not a pure substance"	yes or no	grade5	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	A silkmoth caterpillar makes a silk cocoon to protect itself during metamorphosis. In a silk factory, the silk from many silkmoth cocoons is spun into fabric. Silkmoth caterpillars that are used to make silk are often called silkworms.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Silk is not a mineral because it does not meet the criteria to be classified as such. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a fixed chemical composition and a crystalline structure. Silk, however, is an organic substance produced by the silkmoth caterpillar and does not have a fixed crystalline structure."
	"What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
Martina was known among her coworkers for her spartan ways."	['Greek history', 'the Bible']	0		closed choice	grade10	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion spartan is Greek history.
Soldiers from the city of Sparta in ancient Greece were known for their self-restraint, self-discipline, and indifference to luxury.
The allusion spartan means simple and austere."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The term ""Spartan"" is derived from the city of Sparta in ancient Greece, known for its military strength and the austerity and simplicity of its people's lifestyle. This term is often used to describe something or someone as being simple, frugal, or austere. Therefore, the source of the allusion in the sentence is Greek history, not the Bible."
	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Layla has a scar on her left elbow."	['acquired', 'inherited']	0	Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The scar on Layla's left elbow is an acquired trait. This is because scars are typically the result of some form of injury or damage to the skin, which occurs during a person's lifetime, and not passed down through genes. Therefore, a scar is not an inherited trait but an acquired one."
	Compare the motion of three ships. Which ship was moving at the lowest speed?	['a ship that moved 290miles east in 10hours', 'a ship that moved 310miles south in 10hours', 'a ship that moved 280miles east in 10hours']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 10 hours. The ship that moved 280 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The speed of a moving object is calculated by the distance it covers over a particular time. In this case, all three ships traveled for the same duration - 10 hours. Therefore, to determine the slowest ship, we simply look at the one that covered the shortest distance in that time. The ship that moved 280 miles in 10 hours covered the shortest distance, hence it was moving at the lowest speed."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force is directly proportional to the proximity of the magnets. In this case, the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than those in Pair 2. Hence, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 as compared to Pair 2. This reasoning aligns with the provided solution."

Her hand applies a force to the book.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Identify pushes and pulls	"A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The woman's hand applies a force to the book.This force moves the book off the shelf. The direction of this force is toward her hand. This force is a pull.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the application of force in a particular direction. When the woman is taking the book off the shelf, she is exerting a force that is directed towards her, which is a pulling motion. If the force were directed away from her, it would be a push. Therefore, the correct answer is that the woman's force on the book is a pull, hence the answer is 1."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. The paper changes into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log splits into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The process of sawing a log in half is a physical change because it does not result in the formation of a new substance. Instead, it is simply changing the shape and size of the log. The original material (wood) still remains the same even after the process, hence it is considered a physical change and not a chemical change."

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force is determined by both the material of the magnets and the distance between them. In this case, all the magnets are made of the same material and the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same. Therefore, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying which sample of gas has a higher temperature based on their average kinetic energies. Since the kinetic energy of a gas is directly related to its temperature, the gas with higher kinetic energy will have a higher temperature. In this case, sample B has a higher average kinetic energy due to the higher mass of its particles. Therefore, sample B has the higher temperature."

Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Grandpa John is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter is ""Dear Grandpa John,"". This is because the first word is capitalized and the greeting ends with a comma, following the standard format for letter salutations. Additionally, ""Grandpa John"" is a proper noun, meaning both names should start with a capital letter. Hence, the first greeting is incorrect because the name 'john' is not capitalized."

Neverland alludes to the story of Peter Pan, a boy who lived in Neverland and never grew up."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text uses an allusion, which is a figure of speech that makes a reference to, or representation of, people, places, events, literary work, myths, or works of art, either directly or by implication. In this case, Neverland refers to the imaginary place from the story of Peter Pan, where children don't grow up. The character Edwin is wishing to escape his adult responsibilities, just like how children in Neverland don't have to worry about growing up. Therefore, it's an allusion to Peter Pan's Neverland."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a large trash can is 20 gallons.
20 fluid ounces and 20 cups are both too little."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: A large trash can typically holds more volume than just 20 cups or 20 fluid ounces. These amounts are too small for a large trash can. A trash can's volume is usually measured in gallons. Therefore, the best estimate for the volume of a large trash can would be 20 gallons."

SOLUTION: The guide words in a dictionary are always in alphabetical order, and they show the first and last words on a page. The word 'think' falls between 'teacher' and 'total' in alphabetical order. Hence, 'think' would be found on a dictionary page with these guide words and not 'trolley' which comes after 'total'."
	Based on this information, what is Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait?	['a black coat', 'a reddish-brown coat']	0	"In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Astro is a horse from this group. Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Astro's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Astro's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Astro's genotype for the coat color trait, Ll, is heterozygous with one dominant (L) and one recessive (l) allele. The dominant allele is for a black coat, and the recessive is for a reddish-brown coat. In cases of heterozygous genotypes, the dominant trait is expressed. Therefore, Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait would be a black coat."

	Select the one substance that is not a mineral.	['Hornblende is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.', 'Pyrite is formed in nature. It is a pure substance.', 'A marble is made in a factory. It is a solid.']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

Hornblende is a mineral.
A marble is made in a factory. But all minerals are formed in nature.
So, a marble is not a mineral.
Pyrite is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The substance that is not a mineral in the given options is a marble.

The correct title is Marley and Me."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The choice 1, ""Marley and Me"" follows the proper capitalization rules for titles in English. The rule states that the first word, the last word, and all important words in a title should be capitalized. The conjunction 'and' is not usually considered an important word, hence it is not capitalized. However, given that it is the last word in the title, it is capitalized in this case. Therefore, ""Marley and Me"" is the correct title."

Trade winds are steady winds that blow towards the equator. On Thursday, they were blowing strong from the north in Cape Verde.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the wind direction in Cape Verde on Thursday. This passage describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage is describing the weather, not the climate. This is because it's giving a specific account of the atmospheric conditions at a particular place (Cape Verde) at a specific time (on Thursday), which is the definition of weather. If the passage was describing the general pattern of weather conditions over a long period of time in Cape Verde, then it would be describing the climate."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task is a comparison of kinetic energies and temperature in two different gas samples. Kinetic energy depends on both the mass of the particles and their speed. According to the given solution, particles in sample A are both heavier and faster than those in sample B. Therefore, they possess higher kinetic energy. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles, sample A has a higher temperature."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of an eyelash is 7 millimeters.
7 centimeters, 7 meters, and 7 kilometers are all too long."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the length of an eyelash is 7 millimeters. This is because an eyelash is a very small part of the human body, and it would not be possible for it to be 7 centimeters, 7 meters, or 7 kilometers in length. These measurements are much too large for such a small body part."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Luddite is British history.
In the early nineteenth century, factories were replacing the jobs of craftsmen. Some of these craftsmen banded together to destroy the new machinery; those who did so were called Luddites.
The allusion Luddite means a person opposed to new technology."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The term ""Luddite"" originates from British history, specifically during the Industrial Revolution in the early 19th century. It refers to a group of workers who feared the advancements in technology, particularly in the textile industry, and resorted to destroying machinery in an attempt to preserve their jobs. Therefore, in the context of this question, Mr. Larson's aversion to owning a cell phone is likened to the Luddites' resistance to technological progress."

The correct title is An Eye for an Eye."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct title of a book should have the first and last words capitalized, as well as all principal words in between. Minor words like prepositions and articles are usually left in lowercase unless they are the first or last words of the title. Therefore, the correct title is 'An Eye for an Eye'.

The second time they appear, the words new and familiar are in reverse order."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The figure of speech used in the text is chiasmus. This is made evident by the way the words 'new' and 'familiar' are used in reverse order in the second half of the sentence, creating a mirrored or criss-cross structure. 'New things are made familiar' is paralleled by 'familiar things are made new'. This reversal of words is not present in an apostrophe, which is a figure of speech that directly addresses an absent person or a personified abstraction."

['a liquid', 'a solid', 'a gas']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"A juice pop is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
If you take a juice pop out of the freezer, it will melt. While a juice pop is frozen, though, it is a solid."	"ANSWER: 1

In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for red eyes, and the allele e is for black eyes.
Zora, a koi fish from this group, has red eyes. Zora has two alleles for red eyes."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Zora has two alleles for red eyes (E). So, Zora's genotype for the eye color gene is EE.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The genotype of an organism refers to the combination of alleles it possesses for a certain gene. In this case, Zora the koi fish has red eyes, and the information tells us that the allele for red eyes is E. Furthermore, it is stated that Zora has two alleles for red eyes, which means her genotype for the eye color gene is EE. So, the correct choice is 1 (EE)."
	Two rocks have the same temperature but different masses. Which rock has less thermal energy?	['the rock with more mass', 'the rock with less mass']	1	The objects are made of the same type of matter.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two rocks have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the rock with less mass has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The rock with less mass has less thermal energy. This is due to the fact that thermal energy is the total energy of all the particles in an object. Therefore, a rock with less mass would have fewer particles and hence less total energy. Even though both rocks have the same temperature, the amount of thermal energy is dependent on the mass of the object. Therefore, the rock with less mass would have less thermal energy."

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. They has been replaced with the authors.
The authors say that Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen accidentally discovered X-rays when experimenting with vacuum tubes."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The vague pronoun in choice 1 is ""They"", which doesn't refer to any specific person or group of people. Without an antecedent, it is unclear who ""they"" are. This makes the sentence confusing to understand, hence it contains a vague pronoun reference. On the other hand, choice 0 is clear and specific about who is speaking, ""the authors"", avoiding the use of a vague pronoun."

Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One motorboat moved 355 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other motorboat moved 65 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each motorboat spent the same amount of time moving. The motorboat that moved 355 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The speed of a moving object is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took to travel that distance. Both motorboats traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours). However, the first motorboat traveled a longer distance (355 kilometers) compared to the second one (65 kilometers). Therefore, the first motorboat was moving at a higher speed."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to knit. Instead, many people learn how to knit. Knitting well takes practice. So, knitting well is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The ability to knit is not a trait that is genetically passed down from parents to their offspring, but rather a skill that is learned and developed over time. This makes it an acquired trait. Elizabeth's proficiency in knitting sweaters is likely due to learning and practice, not an inherited genetic trait. Therefore, the correct answer is ""acquired""."

The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The nutria has large front teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The nutria uses its mouth to gnaw on stems and branches."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The tiger's mouth is adapted to tear through meat, similar to the Nile crocodile. Both these animals are carnivores and use their large mouths and sharp teeth to catch and consume their prey. On the other hand, the nutria, which is a herbivore, uses its large front teeth to gnaw on stems and branches, not meat. Therefore, the tiger is the correct answer."

Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.

Photosynthesis happens when plants use water, carbon dioxide, and energy from sunlight to make sugar."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The process of pollen transferring from a male cone to a female cone is known as pollination. This is a crucial step in the reproduction cycle of plants. The hint also suggests that the answer involves the transfer of pollen from a male to a female cone, which is the definition of pollination.

Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal."	"Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there was 1 solute particle on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right."	"ANSWER: (1) to the left than to the right
SOLUTION: The diagram initially shows 1 particle on the left and 5 on the right side of the membrane. After the diffusion process, the diagram shows 3 particles on each side, indicating equilibrium has been reached. In order for this balance to occur, more particles must have moved from the right side (which initially had more particles) to the left side (which initially had fewer particles). Therefore, more solute particles moved across the membrane to the left than to the right."

While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?"	"The writer could best improve his or her grammar and mechanics by punctuating quotations correctly.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

A firework exploding is a chemical change. During the explosion, the type of matter in the firework changes. This change produces sound, heat, and light.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A firework exploding is a chemical change because new substances are formed as a result of the explosion. This process involves a chemical reaction where the substances before and after the reaction are different. The light, heat, and sound produced during the explosion are energy forms that are released during this chemical change. This is why the correct answer is 0, which stands for a chemical change."

Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 255 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Both mountain bikers spent the same amount of time biking - 10 hours. However, the biker who covered 255 kilometers in that time must have been moving at a higher speed than the biker who covered only 190 kilometers in the same time period. Hence, the mountain biker who moved 255 kilometers in 10 hours was moving at a higher speed."

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.

Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ozone is composed of only one chemical element. So, ozone is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because ozone is made up of only one type of atom, which is oxygen. Despite it being composed of three oxygen atoms, it does not contain atoms of different elements. Therefore, it is not a compound but an elementary substance. A compound, by definition, would consist of two or more different elements."

You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	In this experiment, Patty investigated whether watering plants with greywater affects the health of the plants. The plants watered with tap water did not get greywater.

The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the H allele, which is for not having horns, is dominant over the h allele, which is for having horns.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to offspring that have horns is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have horns. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have horns."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The Punnett square shows that all 4 boxes have the genotype HH or Hh, which means they will not have horns as the H allele is dominant. There are no boxes with the genotype hh, which is necessary for horns to be present. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to offspring that have horns is 4:0, meaning the second choice is the correct answer."

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Cheyenne's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Cheyenne's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Cheyenne's genotype is HH, with H being the dominant allele for not having horns. Because she has two dominant alleles (HH), her phenotype reflects the trait associated with that dominant gene, which in this case is not having horns. Therefore, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait is not having horns."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"The air inside a soap bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a soap bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The air inside a soap bubble is a gas. This is because gases have the ability to fill any space or shape, which is exactly what happens inside a soap bubble. The air expands to fill the bubble, taking its shape. Furthermore, when the bubble pops, the gas (air) further expands to fill the surrounding space."

Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	"A fertilized egg can grow into a mature fern.
A heart-shaped plant grows from a spore, not from a fertilized egg."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The hint provided indicates that the diagram shows the life cycle of a fern. This suggests that the fertilized egg in question is related to the fern's life cycle. In general, a fertilized egg is a stage in the life cycle of many organisms, including ferns, and can develop into a mature organism. Therefore, a fertilized egg can grow into a mature fern.

SOLUTION: The tamandua has a tube-shaped snout and a long, sticky tongue which are adaptations that allow it to eat insects from burrows, similar to the giant anteater. The kudu, on the other hand, has a wide snout and eats leaves and shoots, indicating that its mouth is not adapted to get insects out of burrows.

	"What do these two changes have in common?
sewing an apron
water evaporating from a lake"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	0		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But sewing an apron is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Both ""sewing an apron"" and ""water evaporating from a lake"" are physical changes. In the case of sewing an apron, the fabric and thread are physically manipulated to create a new object but their chemical compositions remain unchanged. In the case of water evaporating, the state of the water changes from liquid to gas, but it remains H2O, meaning there is no chemical change. Therefore, the correct answer is (0) Both are only physical changes."

	Which drop of dish soap has more thermal energy?	['the hotter drop of dish soap', 'the colder drop of dish soap']	0	Two drops of dish soap are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two drops of dish soap are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter drop of dish soap has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the more thermal energy it possesses. Since the hotter drop of dish soap has a higher temperature than the colder one, it contains more thermal energy.

An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Fifi has two alleles for normal ears (E). So, Fifi's genotype for the ear type gene is EE.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage states that Fifi has two alleles for normal ears, and the allele for normal ears is represented by the letter E. Since Fifi has two of these alleles, her genotype for the ear type gene is represented as EE. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 (EE)."
	Which sentence uses a metaphor?	['The baby fish in the aquarium are as tiny as specks.', 'The baby fish in the aquarium are tiny specks.']	1		closed choice	grade4	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"This sentence uses a metaphor:

She is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20N. Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15N.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on the cactus, look at the forces:
Ariana is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20 N.
Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 20 N and 15 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The forces acting on the cactus are not equal and opposite. Ariana is pulling the cactus upwards with a force of 20N, while Earth's gravity is pulling it downwards with a force of 15N. Since these forces are not balanced, there is a net force acting on the cactus. This makes the forces unbalanced, hence the correct answer is 0."

The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion spidey sense is a comic book.
The comic book superhero Spider-Man possesses a spidey sense that warns him of impending trouble.
The allusion spidey sense means a sense of danger coming."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phrase ""spidey sense"" is a direct allusion to the comic book superhero Spider-Man, who has a special sense that allows him to perceive danger before it happens. This phrase has been widely adopted in popular culture to refer to a gut feeling or intuition about something potentially harmful or dangerous. Therefore, the source of the allusion is a comic book, not a song."

The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks."	"Look at the picture of the military macaw.
The military macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The military macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The Alexandrine parakeet has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts.
The western kingbird has a straight, thin beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The western kingbird uses its beak to eat insects."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The Alexandrine parakeet was chosen because it has a thick hooked beak, which is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. This is the similar adaptation to the military macaw as given in the hint. On the contrary, the western kingbird has a straight, thin beak, which is not adapted for such a task but for eating insects. Hence, the Alexandrine parakeet fits the description in the question."

SOLUTION: The task requires comparing the average kinetic energy of particles in two samples. The information given indicates that both samples have the same number of particles, each with the same mass and average speed. This implies that both samples have the same average kinetic energy. Since temperature corresponds to the average kinetic energy of particles, both samples must have the same temperature. Therefore, the answer is ""neither; the samples have the same temperature""."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a lake
ice crystals forming on a window"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	2		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Ice crystals forming on a window is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air can change directly into ice when it touches a very cold window! A change of state from a gas to a solid is called depositing.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But ice crystals forming on a window is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Ice crystals form on a window when water vapor in the air becomes ice. This is caused by cooling. But water evaporating from a lake is not."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Both changes described, water evaporating from a lake and ice crystals forming on a window, are examples of physical changes. This means that while the state or appearance of the substance changes, the actual composition or type of matter does not. Therefore, the answer is ""Both are only physical changes."" Neither of the changes are chemical, nor are they both caused by heating or cooling."

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Lady is a horse from this group. Lady has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Lady's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Lady's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: (1)
SOLUTION: The task asks to identify Lady's phenotype based on her genotype and the dominance pattern of the alleles. Lady's genotype is Ll, which means she carries both the dominant (L) and recessive (l) alleles. However, since the allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l), Lady's phenotype will reflect the dominant trait. Therefore, Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence

"	The text argues that Porter can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Porter can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text is using the guilt by association logical fallacy. Here, the speaker is trying to discredit Porter's credibility as a class treasurer based on the actions of his uncle. This fallacy suggests that because Porter's uncle was involved in financial crime, Porter must be untrustworthy as well, which is not necessarily true.

Radon is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	0	Radon is a gas that can cause lung cancer if it is breathed in large quantities. The chemical formula for radon is Rn.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether radon is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for radon is Rn. This formula contains one symbol: Rn. So, the formula tells you that radon is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, radon is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Radon, represented by the symbol 'Rn', is an individual chemical element and not a compound of different elements. Hence, it is an elementary substance. This is evident from its chemical formula which includes only one chemical symbol. Therefore, the correct choice is option 0 which states that Radon is an elementary substance."

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	"In this experiment, Bernard investigated whether adding soap to water affects how much water can fit on a penny. So, the pennies with soapy water were part of an experimental group.
The pennies with pure water did not get soapy water. So, they were not part of an experimental group."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The experimental group in an experiment is the group that receives the variable being tested. In this case, Bernard is testing the effect of adding soap to water on the amount of water a penny can hold. Therefore, the pennies with soapy water are part of the experimental group, hence the answer is 0. The pennies with pure water serve as a control group for comparison."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 5 hours. The ship that moved 210 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The speed of a moving object is calculated by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken. In this case, all three ships travelled for the same amount of time, 5 hours. Hence, the ship that covered the most distance, 210 miles, in that time would have the highest speed. The direction in which the ships moved has no impact on the speed. Therefore, the ship that moved 210 miles south in 5 hours was moving at the highest speed."

['a song', 'literature']	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Dickensian is literature.
The works of British author Charles Dickens often featured characters struggling to survive in settings such as debtors' prisons and orphanages.
The allusion Dickensian means harsh or poverty-stricken."	"ANSWER: (1)
SOLUTION: The term 'Dickensian' refers to the style or themes present in the works of the famous English novelist Charles Dickens. His works are well-known for their depiction of the poor social conditions of 19th-century England. Therefore, when Zach describes his childhood as 'Dickensian', he is making an allusion to literature, specifically the works of Charles Dickens. Thus, the correct answer is 1, literature."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The question asks about the impact of magnet size on the magnitude of the magnetic force. Although the magnets in both pairs are made from the same material, the size of the magnets differs between the pairs. Since the size of the magnet influences the magnitude of the magnetic force, and Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2, the magnetic force would be smaller in Pair 1.

	Based on this information, what is Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait?	['pale orange cheeks', 'bright orange cheeks']	1	"In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
Jack is a cockatiel from this group. Jack has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Jack's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Jack's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The information given explains that Jack's genotype for the cheek color trait is heterozygous, which means he carries both the dominant and recessive alleles. In such cases, the dominant allele is expressed, overriding the recessive one. Thus, since the allele for bright orange cheeks is the dominant allele, Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait is bright orange cheeks."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
burning a candle
melting glass"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	2		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But burning a candle is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (2)
SOLUTION: Both burning a candle and melting glass are changes that occur due to the application of heat. In the case of the candle, heat is required to initiate the chemical reaction that results in burning. For the glass, heat is required to change its state from solid to liquid. Therefore, the common factor between these two changes is that they are both caused by heating."

SOLUTION: The speed of a sailboat can be calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. All three sailboats traveled for the same amount of time, 5 hours. The sailboat that moved 35 kilometers in this time frame traveled the shortest distance, therefore, it must have had the lowest speed. So, the answer is sailboat 2."

It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase sang in. It describes the wind as if it were a singer.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ""sang in"" because it uses personification, a figure of speech in which non-human things are given human attributes. Here, the wind is described as if it has the human ability to sing. On the other hand, ""rushed by"" is a phrase that can literally happen, hence, it does not represent personification."

['ethos (character)', 'pathos (emotion)', 'logos (reason)']	0		closed choice	grade12	language science	writing-strategies	Persuasive strategies	Identify appeals to ethos, pathos, and logos in advertisements	"The purpose of an advertisement is to persuade people to do something. To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury"	The ad appeals to ethos, or character, by emphasizing the quality standards that are part of the brand's identity.	"The task requires identifying the rhetorical appeal primarily used in a hypothetical advertisement. The choices provided are ethos (appeal to character), pathos (appeal to emotion), and logos (appeal to reason). The solution hints that the ad focuses on the quality standards associated with the brand's identity, which is an appeal to ethos. 

ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Ethos is the correct answer because the ad emphasizes the quality standards, which is a reflection of the brand's character or credibility. Ethos is a rhetorical appeal that leverages the speaker's or, in this case, the brand's authority, ethics, or trustworthiness to persuade the audience."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The question asked to compare the average kinetic energies of particles in two samples and determine which sample has the higher temperature. The solution clearly states that sample B has particles with more mass and higher average speed, therefore higher kinetic energy. It is a known fact in physics that the temperature of a gas is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Thus, sample B has a higher temperature."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

4 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A large soup pot typically holds more than 4 milliliters. One milliliter is equivalent to about a fifth of a teaspoon, which is a very small amount. On the other hand, 4 liters is a much more reasonable volume for a large soup pot as it equals roughly 1 gallon, which is a common size for large cooking pots. Hence, the better estimate is 4 liters."

The two glasses of orange juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 70Â°F glass of orange juice is hotter than the 45Â°F glass of orange juice, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy it contains. In this case, the 70Â°F glass of orange juice is at a higher temperature than the 45Â°F glass of orange juice. Therefore, the 70Â°F glass of orange juice has more thermal energy."

SOLUTION: Burlap is the correct answer because it is not a natural substance like rocks, but rather a material made by humans. Rocks such as Chert and Calcarenite, on the other hand, are naturally occurring solids formed in nature, not produced by human or living activity. Hence, Burlap, being a man-made material, does not possess the properties of a rock."

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each speedboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each speedboat moved for 5 hours. The speedboat that moved 395 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that speedboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: (0)
SOLUTION: To find the speed, we need to divide the distance by the time taken. All the speedboats were moving for the same time duration, so the speedboat which covered the maximum distance in the same time span was moving the fastest. In this case, the speedboat that moved 395 kilometers in 5 hours covered the most distance, therefore, it was moving at the highest speed."

Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Romeo is literature.
In William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is known for the eloquent declaration of love with which he woos Juliet.
The allusion Romeo means a man who is very romantic."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The source of the allusion Romeo is indeed literature. This is derived from William Shakespeare's play ""Romeo and Juliet"" where Romeo is portrayed as an ideal lover, hence the allusion to someone being a 'Romeo' means that they are very romantic or a womanizer. This has nothing to do with British history, which is why the answer is literature."

Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services.

A certain bitter melon plant from this group has dark brown seeds. This plant has two alleles for dark brown seeds."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The bitter melon plant's observable version of the seed color trait is dark brown seeds. So, the plant's phenotype for the seed color trait is dark brown seeds.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The question asks about the phenotype of the plant, which is the observable characteristic or trait. In this case, the observable trait is the color of the seeds.

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the average kinetic energies of particles in two samples and determining which sample has the higher temperature. The solution explains that each particle in sample B has more mass and a higher average speed than those in sample A, resulting in higher average kinetic energy. As temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of a system, sample B has the higher temperature."

You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	"In this experiment, Jennifer investigated whether storing bread in dark bins affects mold growth. So, the loaves of bread in bins covered with dark paper were part of an experimental group.
The loaves of bread in bins with no covering were not stored in dark bins. So, they were not part of an experimental group."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The experimental group in an experiment is the group that is subjected to the change or variable being tested. In this case, Jennifer was investigating whether covering the bins with dark paper (which would make them dark bins) would affect mold growth on bread. Therefore, the loaves of bread in bins covered with dark paper were part of the experimental group.

	How long is a sofa?	['7 feet', '7 yards']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of a sofa is 7 feet.
7 yards is too long."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A typical sofa length ranges between 6 to 8 feet. Therefore, 7 feet is a reasonable estimate for the length of a sofa. On the other hand, 7 yards, which is equivalent to 21 feet, is significantly longer than a standard sofa. Consequently, it is an unlikely estimate for the length of a sofa."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
cooking an egg
salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	0		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a chemical change. The salt and vinegar change the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. This makes the penny look shiny again.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Cooking an egg and removing tarnish from a penny with salt and vinegar are both examples of chemical changes. In both cases, the original matter is altered to become a different type of matter: a raw egg becomes a cooked egg, and tarnish becomes easily removable residue. Neither are physical changes or changes caused by heating or cooling alone. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas that is produced by some types of bacteria found in swamps and marshes.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"All substances are made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.

	Which helium balloon has more thermal energy?	['the hotter helium balloon', 'the colder helium balloon']	0	Two helium balloons are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two helium balloons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter helium balloon has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; the higher the temperature, the higher the thermal energy. In this case, since the two helium balloons are identical in every other aspect, the only differentiating factor is the temperature. Therefore, the hotter helium balloon, choice 0, has more thermal energy because it has a higher temperature."

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Estelle will sweep the sidewalk in front of her store"" is in the future tense. The use of ""will"" before the verb ""sweep"" indicates that the action is going to take place in the future. Therefore, it is not in the present tense (option 0) or past tense (option 1), so the correct answer is future tense (option 2)."

"	The text argues that a week without rain is evidence that Seattle isn't a rainy city. However, the experience of one week doesn't necessarily reflect longer trends in a place's climate. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The statement makes a broad claim about Seattle's climate based on just one week of observation, which is insufficient data to make such generalization. This is a perfect example of a hasty generalization, a logical fallacy where a person draws a conclusion about a population based on a small sample that is not representative. Hence, the logical fallacy used in the text is a hasty generalization."

A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the eye color gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the eye color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The fruit fly's genotype is Ee, where E is the dominant gene for red eye color and e is the recessive gene for brown eye color. As per the law of dominance, in a heterozygous condition, the dominant gene is expressed. Hence, the fruit fly's phenotype would be red eyes. So, the answer is 0 for red eyes."

"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the relationship between kinetic energy, temperature, and mass of gas particles. The hint and solution provided clarify that while both samples have the same number of particles and average speed, the particles in sample B are more massive. As kinetic energy is directly related to mass, it means that the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy. Higher kinetic energy correlates with higher temperature, therefore sample B has the higher temperature."

['wood', 'mammal tooth']	0	This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	earth-science	Fossils	Compare ages of fossils in a rock sequence	"A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The wood fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the mammal tooth fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely younger than the mammal tooth fossil."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The wood fossil is stated to be in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the mammal tooth fossil. In geology, the law of superposition states that in undisturbed layers of rock, the oldest rocks are at the bottom and the rocks become progressively younger toward the top. Therefore, the wood fossil, which is in a shallower (or higher) layer, is younger than the mammal tooth fossil."

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"An agile wallaby's scientific name is Macropus agilis. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus.
Macropus giganteus is in the genus Macropus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. So, Macropus giganteus and Macropus agilis are in the same genus.

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the average kinetic energy of two samples and determining which has the higher temperature. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to mass and speed and it is given that particles in sample B have more mass while both samples have the same speed, sample B has a higher average kinetic energy. Therefore, sample B also has a higher temperature."

Gabby will spend more time making the beef barley soup than she would have spent making the vegetable soup."	"ANSWER: 0 
SOLUTION: The correct answer is choice 0 because it reflects the cost Gabby has to pay in terms of time. Making beef barley soup requires more time than making vegetable soup, which means Gabby is sacrificing her time. In economics, a cost is often considered as a sacrifice of resources. Here, time is the resource Gabby is giving up, thus it is considered a cost."

Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change because it involves a change in the composition of the substance. The iron in the metal gate reacts with oxygen in the air to form a new substance, rust, which has different properties from the original substance. This process is irreversible, which is another characteristic of a chemical change."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
compost rotting
burning a candle"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But compost rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (3) 
SOLUTION: Both compost rotting and burning a candle result in new substances being formed, which indicates that they are chemical changes. Compost rotting involves the breaking down of organic matter into a different type, and burning a candle involves the wax reacting with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and soot. Neither process is a mere physical change nor are they caused by heating or cooling. Thus, the common factor is that both are chemical changes."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the basic principle of magnetism which states that similar poles repel each other and opposite poles attract. In the given scenario, it is mentioned that the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other. This means that the magnets will repel each other, hence, the answer is 1."

This type of change can occur at Earth's surface or below it.
Sedimentary rock is formed when layers of sediment are pressed together, or compacted, to make rock. This type of change occurs below Earth's surface.
Metamorphic rock is formed when a rock is changed by very high temperature and pressure. This type of change often occurs deep below Earth's surface.

The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Shale forms when the bottom layers of mud are pressed together to form rock."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The answer is 0, which represents sedimentary rocks. Shale is a type of sedimentary rock because it is formed from layers of sediment, specifically mud, that build up over time in places like lakes, oceans, and rivers. This process involves the pressing of the top layers on the bottom ones which forces out water and air and eventually forms rock. The presence of fossils in shale also indicates that it is sedimentary."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
Cells using oxygen to break down sugar is a chemical change. When sugar is broken down, it forms carbon dioxide and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (3) Both are chemical changes.
SOLUTION: Both a slice of banana turning brown and cells using oxygen to break down sugar are examples of chemical changes. In the case of the banana, it reacts with the oxygen in the air and changes its matter, and in the case of the cells, the sugar breaks down into carbon dioxide and water. These are not physical changes, nor are they caused by heating or cooling. Thus, the answer is option 3."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task asks to compare the average kinetic energies of particles in two samples and determine which one has a higher temperature. The solution provides that the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B, given that each particle in sample A has more mass. Since temperature is proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles, sample A, therefore, has a higher temperature."

The allele F is for bumpy fruit, and the allele f is for smooth fruit.
A certain cucumber plant from this group has smooth fruit. This plant has two alleles for smooth fruit."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The cucumber plant's observable version of the fruit texture trait is smooth fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait is smooth fruit.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The phenotype of an organism is the observable characteristic or trait. In this case, the trait being observed is the texture of the cucumber fruit. As per the information provided, the cucumber plant in question has smooth fruit. Therefore, the phenotype for the fruit texture trait in this cucumber plant is 'smooth fruit'.

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	All three marbles have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 4Â°C marble is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is related to the temperature of an object, with higher temperatures indicating higher thermal energy. In this case, all three objects are identical marbles with the only difference being their temperatures. The marble at 4Â°C is the coldest and, therefore, has the least thermal energy of the three."

Huntington's disease is a condition that causes the death of brain cells over time. This loss of cells interferes with brain function and may lead to uncontrolled movements, difficulty thinking, and changes in behavior.
In a group of humans, some individuals have Huntington's disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Huntington's disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive to the allele for having Huntington's disease (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two humans."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have Huntington's disease, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for not having Huntington's disease, is recessive to the H allele, which is for having Huntington's disease.
Not having Huntington's disease is the recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the recessive version of the Huntington's disease trait must have only recessive alleles for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that do not have Huntington's disease must have the genotype hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
Having Huntington's disease is the dominant allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the dominant version of the Huntington's disease trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that have Huntington's disease must have the genotype HH or Hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype HH or Hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring that do not have Huntington's disease for every 2 offspring that have Huntington's disease."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The given text clearly states that the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 2:2. This ratio means that for every 2 offspring that do not have Huntington's disease, there are 2 offspring that have Huntington's disease. Therefore, the answer is 0 which corresponds to the 2:2 ratio in the given choices."

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Dasher is a horse from this group. Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Dasher's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Dasher's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dasher's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Dasher's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: (1)
SOLUTION: The question is asking what is Dasher's phenotype for coat color given that he has a homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene. The text explains that the L allele, which Dasher has two of, is dominant and codes for a black coat. Since Dasher's genotype is LL, this means he will display the dominant phenotype, which is a black coat. Thus, the correct answer is (1) a black coat."

	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	"[""If Danny winds up attending Adam's performance, he will let Susan know."", ""Danny will let Susan know if he winds up attending Adam's performance.""]"	0		closed choice	grade6	language science	pronouns	Pronouns and antecedents	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun he could refer to Danny or Adam.

	What is the mass of a full bag of groceries?	['5 ounces', '5 pounds', '5 tons']	1	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of mass	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a full bag of groceries is 5 pounds.
5 ounces is too light and 5 tons is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A full bag of groceries typically weighs around 5 pounds. This is a reasonable estimate as it takes into account the weight of common grocery items such as milk, fruits, vegetables, and canned goods. 5 ounces would be too light to account for the usual assortment of groceries, while 5 tons is an unrealistically high weight for a bag of groceries. Therefore, option 1 is the best estimate."
	Is there a surplus or a shortage of bunk beds?	['shortage', 'surplus']	1	A furniture store has 20 bunk beds for sale. The beds cost $300 each. At that price, 15 people want to buy one.	closed choice	grade5	social science	economics	Supply and demand	Identify shortage and surplus	"There is a surplus if there is too much for sale at a given price.
There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage."	"At the current price, there are too many bunk beds for sale. There are 20 beds for sale, but only 15 people want to buy one.
So, there is a surplus of bunk beds. The furniture store will not get any money for the leftover bunk beds."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding supply and demand. The demand for bunk beds is 15 while the supply is 20. This means that the supply exceeds the demand, resulting in a surplus. Thus the answer is 1 which signifies surplus. The extra 5 bunk beds in the furniture store constitute the surplus as they are not in demand at the current price."

['a liquid', 'a solid', 'a gas']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	A pipe cleaner is a solid. You can easily bend a pipe cleaner. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A pipe cleaner is a solid because it retains its shape and volume regardless of where it is placed. It has a fixed structure and cannot flow or take the shape of a container like a liquid or a gas. Despite its flexibility, it remains a solid because it does not change its volume or become dispersed like a gas."

The two glasses of grape juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 10Â°C glass of grape juice is colder than the 15Â°C glass of grape juice, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy the object possesses.

	Based on this information, what is Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait?	['not having myotonia congenita', 'mm']	0	"This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:

In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele M is for having myotonia congenita, and the allele m is for not having myotonia congenita.
Echo, a goat from this group, does not have myotonia congenita. Echo has two alleles for not having myotonia congenita."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita. So, Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phenotype of an organism is the observable characteristic or trait. In this case, Echo, the goat does not have myotonia congenita, which is the observable trait. This means that Echo's phenotype for the trait is not having myotonia congenita. Hence, the correct choice is 0 - not having myotonia congenita."
	Select the elementary substance.	['sulfur dioxide (SO2)', 'neon (Ne)', 'fluoromethanol (CH3FO)']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Identify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide contains two symbols: S for sulfur and O for oxygen. So, sulfur dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, sulfur dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for neon contains one symbol: Ne. So, neon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, neon is an elementary substance.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is neon (Ne). An elementary substance is a substance that is made up of only one type of atom and cannot be broken down or changed into a different substance through chemical reactions. As described in the solution, neon is made of only one type of atom, hence it is an elementary substance. The other choices, sulfur dioxide and fluoromethanol, are compounds made up of more than one type of atom."

Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Most humans are born with five fingers on each hand. So, having five fingers is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The number of fingers on a human hand is determined by our genetic information, which we inherit from our parents. This means it's not an acquired trait, which would be influenced by environmental factors after birth. As the hint suggests that Patty was born with five fingers on each hand, it is clear that this is an inherited trait. Therefore, the answer is ""inherited""."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material.

Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Biotite has all the properties of a mineral. So, biotite is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because biotite meets all the criteria to be classified as a mineral. It is a pure substance, it occurs naturally, it is not made by living things, it is solid, and it has a fixed crystal structure. Therefore, it is correct to say that biotite is a mineral."

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The insect fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the dinosaur footprint fossil. So, the insect fossil is most likely younger than the dinosaur footprint fossil."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The insect fossil is younger according to the principles of stratigraphy. This principle states that in undisturbed rock layers, the oldest rocks are at the bottom and the rocks become progressively younger toward the top. Since the insect fossil is found in a shallower layer of the rock sequence than the dinosaur footprint, it means it is younger."

You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water boiling is a physical change. But baking a pie is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking a pie is a chemical change. But water boiling is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (2)
SOLUTION: Both water boiling on a stove and baking an apple pie are processes that require heating. Boiling is a physical change that occurs when water is heated, and baking an apple pie involves a chemical change that is also facilitated by heat. Neither of the processes is caused by cooling, and the changes involved are not exclusively physical or chemical. Therefore, the commonality between these two changes is that they are both caused by heating."

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, point. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: (2) future tense
SOLUTION: The sentence ""I will point her out to you"" is in future tense. This is identified by the use of the auxiliary verb ""will"" before the main verb ""point"". In English grammar, the use of ""will"" before a verb denotes an action that is yet to occur, hence placing it in the future tense."

"	"The better estimate for the temperature of the air on a cold, snowy day is 20Â°F.
20Â°C is too hot."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The better estimate for the temperature of the air on a cold, snowy day is 20Â°F. This is because the freezing point of water is 0Â°C or 32Â°F. Therefore, for snow to occur, the temperature must be below freezing. 20Â°C is well above freezing and thus not typically associated with snowy conditions."

Boron trifluoride is ()."	['a compound', 'an elementary substance']	0	Boron trifluoride is used to make many types of chemicals, such as plastics. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride is BF3.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether boron trifluoride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for boron trifluoride is BF3. This formula contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, the formula tells you that boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trifluoride is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The chemical formula for boron trifluoride is BF3, which includes two elements, boron (B) and fluorine (F). The presence of two different elements indicates that it is a compound, not an elementary substance. Therefore, the answer is option 0, which states that boron trifluoride is a compound."

Photosynthesis is a ()."	['physical change', 'chemical change']	1		closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Photosynthesis is a chemical change. Plants make sugar using carbon dioxide, water, and energy from sunlight.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Photosynthesis is a chemical change because it involves the transformation of carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen, using sunlight. This process cannot be physically reversed and new substances are formed as a result, which are the key characteristics of a chemical change. Therefore, option 1 is the correct answer."

An oxymoron is a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Some reviewers are calling this book a new classic.
A paradox is a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
Always expect the unexpected."	"The text uses a paradox, a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
Nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded at first appears to be contradictory, because if no one goes to the restaurant, then the restaurant should be empty, not crowded. However, it contains some truth: if a restaurant is frequently perceived to be too crowded, many people will no longer want to go there."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The correct answer is paradox. The statement ""nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded"" is a classic example of a paradox, where two seemingly contradictory statements are made, but upon further reflection, they express a possible truth. In this case, the paradox is that despite being crowded, nobody goes there, implying that the place has lost its appeal due to being too crowded. An oxymoron, on the other hand, combines two contradictory terms in a single phrase, which is not the case in this text."

Some words are close in meaning but have different connotations.
For example, think about the words eager and impatient. They both mean wanting something to happen, but they have different connotations.
Eager has a positive connotation. It is a nice word. An eager person is happy and excited.
Impatient has a negative connotation. It is not a nice word. An impatient person is often pushy and demanding."	A bullheaded employee has a more negative connotation. Bullheaded and persistent both denote not backing down. However, bullheaded describes a person who is overly stubborn, while persistent describes a person who is determined and tenacious.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The term ""bullheaded"" is chosen as it has a more negative connotation.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The tomato plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is ff. The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for fuzzy fruit. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the tomato plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The tomato plant in question has a homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene. The allele 'f' is associated with fuzzy fruit and is recessive. Since this plant has two 'f' alleles, it will express the trait associated with this allele, which is fuzzy fruit. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait is fuzzy fruit."

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task explains that the magnitudes of magnetic forces are influenced by the sizes of the magnets involved. It is mentioned that Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, but Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Therefore, since the size of a magnet influences the magnitude of the magnetic force, and Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 2 is smaller. This corresponds to choice 0."

In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Kraken is a guppy from this group. Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.

A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Kraken's genotype for the tail spots gene is II. Kraken's genotype of II has only I allelles. The I allele is for a spotted tail. So, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Kraken's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Kraken's genotype of II has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Kraken's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be a spotted tail."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Kraken's genotype is homozygous dominant for the tail spots gene which means he has two copies of the dominant allele (I). The dominant allele codes for a spotted tail phenotype, and since dominant traits only need one copy to be expressed, Kraken's phenotype would be a spotted tail. Therefore, the correct answer is 0, a spotted tail."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.

30 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A small candy bar is quite light and it certainly doesn't weigh anywhere near 30 kilograms. 30 grams is a more realistic estimate for the mass of a small candy bar. A kilogram is 1000 times heavier than a gram, so 30 kilograms is an excessively large weight for a candy bar. Hence, the correct answer is 30 grams."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Shelley's skin color is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The skin color of a person is determined by heredity, which means it is passed down from parents to their offspring through their genes. This means that the skin color is an inherited trait. Therefore, Shelley's naturally pale skin is not an acquired characteristic but an inherited one."

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"Oxygen is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
Oxygen can be stored in metal tanks. If oxygen leaks out of the tank, the oxygen will expand into the space around the tank."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Oxygen is a gas at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure, which is the state most humans interact with it. It is a vital element for human survival as it is used for respiration. While it can be cooled and pressurized into a liquid or solid state, these are not its natural states under common conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is that oxygen is a gas."

The words laughter and thunder are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence 'From across the room, Uncle Logan's laughter was booming thunder' uses a metaphor. A metaphor is a figure of speech that makes a comparison between two things that are basically dissimilar. In this case, Uncle Logan's laughter is directly compared to booming thunder, without using 'like' or 'as', which are typically used in similes.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3

	Assume all other forces on Latrell are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on Latrell?	['The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell.', 'The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Latrell.']	0	Latrell is standing on a diving board at the pool. Earth's gravity is pulling down on Latrell with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Latrell with a force of 400N.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Latrell, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Latrell down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Latrell up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The forces acting on Latrell are balanced because the downward force of gravity (400N) is equal and opposite to the upward force from the diving board (400N). As a result, there is no net force acting upon him, meaning the forces are in equilibrium. Therefore, the correct answer is ""The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell."""

SOLUTION: When a tennis player hits the ball, the direction of the push is away from the racket. The racket makes contact with the ball and the force applied sends the ball flying in the opposite direction. This is why the ball moves over the net and away from the player. Therefore, the direction of the push is away from the tennis racket."

The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-ocean subduction zone, which forms when two plates with oceanic crust move toward each other. One of the plates subducts, or sinks, below the other.
When one of the plates subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes in the ocean called a volcanic island arc."	"To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Japan Trench, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Japan Trench is a deep-sea trench east of the islands of Japan. The trench formed as the Pacific Plate subducted, or sank, below the Okhotsk Plate. The two plates continue to move toward each other. This movement can cause devastating earthquakes in Japan, such as a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Japan Trench formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Japan Trench formed at a convergent boundary."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The Japan Trench was formed as the Pacific Plate subducted, or sank, beneath the Okhotsk Plate, which indicates that the two plates were moving towards each other. This type of movement, where two plates collide, is characteristic of a convergent boundary, not a divergent or transform boundary. Thus, the answer is 1, a convergent boundary."

Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant.

Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	"Mature ferns have spore cases on the underside of their fronds. Spores are released from the spore cases.
Heart-shaped plants produce eggs and sperm, not spores."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The life cycle of a fern involves the release of spores from the spore cases on a mature fern. According to the solution provided, mature ferns have spore cases on the underside of their fronds where spores are released. On the other hand, heart-shaped plants produce eggs and sperm, not spores. Therefore, spores are released from spore cases on a mature fern, not on a heart-shaped plant."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The distance between magnets greatly influences the strength of the magnetic force between them. In this instance, Pair 2 has the magnets set at a greater distance apart compared to Pair 1. As a result, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. This is due to the magnetic field lines being more spread out and less concentrated, reducing the magnetic force."

Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the box that is heavier.
A box holding 42 pounds is heavier than a box holding 39 pounds. So, the box holding 42 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other box."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The box that is lifted with a larger force is the one that weighs more, which in this case is the box holding 42 pounds. Force is directly proportional to mass, according to Newton's second law of motion. Thus, a heavier box requires more force to move at the same speed as a lighter one."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The question asks to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample and determine which sample has the higher temperature. According to the given information, each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. This means that the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy. Therefore, the temperature of the samples must be the same. Hence, the answer is 2, stating that neither sample has a higher temperature; they have the same temperature."
	Select the solid.	['air inside a beach ball', 'chocolate syrup', 'apple juice', 'thread']	3		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"Apple juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour apple juice into a different container, the apple juice will take the shape of that container. But the apple juice will still take up the same amount of space.
The air inside a beach ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air fills all the space inside the beach ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.
Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space.
Thread is a solid that can be bent or tangled. But it still has a size and shape of its own."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The thread is the only solid among the choices. Solids have a definite shape and volume, unlike liquids and gases which take the shape of their containers. So, in this case, the thread maintains its own shape and size, characteristic of a solid, regardless of where it is placed, which is unlike the apple juice, air, and chocolate syrup."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a full box of cereal is 20 ounces.
20 pounds and 20 tons are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The mass of a full box of cereal is most likely to be 20 ounces. A box of cereal is typically lightweight and easy to carry, so 20 pounds or 20 tons would be far too heavy. Therefore, option 0, 20 ounces, is the best and most reasonable estimate for the mass of a full box of cereal."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it could refer to the memory card or the digital camera.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. It has been replaced with the card.
Sophia took the memory card out of the digital camera and put the card in her desk drawer."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The first sentence leaves no room for ambiguity as it clearly states that Sophia put the card in her drawer. However, the second sentence contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun ""it"" can refer to either the memory card or the digital camera, causing confusion. Therefore, the second sentence or choice 1 contains a vague pronoun reference."

['the Bible', 'literature']	1		closed choice	grade8	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Scrooge is literature.
The novella A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, tells the story of the penny-pinching and bitter Ebenezer Scrooge, who values money more than people.
The allusion Scrooge means a person who isn't generous."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The allusion to 'Scrooge' in the sentence comes from literature, specifically Charles Dickens's novella A Christmas Carol. In this story, Scrooge is a character known for his miserly and ungenerous behavior. Therefore, the term 'Scrooge' has come to represent anyone who is stingy or unwilling to part with their money. This is why Mr. Nolan, who evidently isn't generous with donations, is referred to as a 'Scrooge'."

SOLUTION: The second choice is correct because it follows the standard conventions for closing a letter. The first word of the closing line should be capitalized and followed by a comma. In the first choice, all the words are not properly capitalized. The second choice, ""See You Soon,"", adheres to all the conventions properly, hence it is the correct choice."
	Based on this information, what is Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait?	['not having agouti fur', 'having agouti fur']	0	"This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A).
Salem is a cat from this group. Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Salem's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa. Salem's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for not having agouti fur. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Salem's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Salem's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The passage states that Salem's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa, which is homozygous recessive. This means he carries two copies of the recessive allele (a), which is associated with not having agouti fur. Therefore, Salem's phenotype, or observable characteristic, is 'not having agouti fur'. This is confirmed by understanding that an organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will express the recessive trait."

['crocodile egg', 'feather']	0	This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Fossils	Compare ages of fossils in a rock sequence	"A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The crocodile egg fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the feather fossil. So, the crocodile egg fossil is most likely younger than the feather fossil."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The crocodile egg fossil is the younger fossil based on the principle of superposition, which states that in an undisturbed sequence of rocks, the youngest rock layers are at the top, and the oldest are at the bottom. As the crocodile egg fossil is in a shallower layer than the feather fossil, it is most likely more recent, or younger, than the feather fossil."

Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above."	H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. O is the symbol for oxygen. According to the legend, oxygen atoms are shown in red. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and O. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There are two oxygen atoms, so O will have a subscript of 2. The correct formula is H2 O2. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The chemical formula H2O2 corresponds to a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. In the given task, it is mentioned that the molecule has two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. Therefore, based on the molecular structure, the correct chemical formula for this molecule is H2O2 which corresponds to choice 2."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

515 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: (0) 515 milliliters
SOLUTION: A typical water balloon is filled with a small amount of water, not exceeding a volume of a few hundred milliliters. It's usually small enough to be held and thrown by hand. On the other hand, 515 liters is a very large volume, equivalent to a small swimming pool or a large bathtub. Therefore, it's highly improbable that a water balloon could contain this much water. Hence, 515 milliliters is a more realistic estimate for the volume of a water balloon."

['the pistil', 'the anthers']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Angiosperm and conifer life cycles	"Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again."	"Anthers make pollen. When a pollinator brushes against the anthers, pollen might stick to the pollinator.
A pollinator may drop pollen on the pistil. This is called pollination. But a pollinator does not pick up pollen from the pistil."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The pollinator picks up pollen from the anthers of a flower. This is where pollen is produced. When a pollinator, such as a bee or a butterfly, visits a flower, it brushes against the anthers and the pollen sticks to it. It does not pick up the pollen from the pistil. Therefore, the answer is 1."

The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The ornamental gourd plant's genotype for the fruit color gene is ff. The ornamental gourd plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for green fruit. So, the ornamental gourd plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the ornamental gourd plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for yellow fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for green fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The ornamental gourd plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the ornamental gourd plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The ornamental gourd plant's genotype for the fruit color gene is ff, which means it has two recessive alleles. According to the information given, the recessive allele is for green fruit. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the fruit color trait must be green fruit, which corresponds to choice 0."

Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Lam's snoring."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text uses verbal irony to indicate the loudness of Mr. Lam's snoring. The phrase ""as quiet as a jackhammer"" is ironic because jackhammers are known to be very loud. Therefore, when the children compare Mr. Lam's snoring to a jackhammer, they are actually implying that it is very loud. Hence, the correct answer is 1: The snoring is loud."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: In the context of magnets, like poles (south-south or north-north) repel each other while unlike poles (south-north or north-south) attract each other. In this scenario, the south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other, implying they are like poles. Given this, the magnets will repel each other, hence the answer is 1."

Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the passage carefully.
The Dominican Republic has lush, green forests and beautiful beaches. Temperatures in the Dominican Republic are usually between 70Â°F and 90Â°F throughout the year.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the usual temperature pattern in the Dominican Republic. This passage does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The passage provides information about the usual temperature range in the Dominican Republic throughout the year, indicating a consistent pattern. This does not refer to the conditions of the atmosphere at a specific time or day, which would be weather. Instead, it relates to the general pattern of weather, which is the definition of climate. Therefore, the passage describes the climate."

['Earth is pulling on the Sun.', 'Earth is pushing on the Sun.']	0	"Isaac Newton was born in the 1600s and studied how objects move. He discovered three fundamental laws about forces and motion. According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force.
Consider the following force:
The Sun is pulling on Earth."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Predict forces using Newton's third law	"According to Newton's third law, for every force, there is an equal and opposite force. This means that if one object is applying a force on a second object, the second object must also be applying a force on the first object, but in the opposite direction.
For example, if your hand is pushing down on a table, the table is also pushing up on your hand. Or, if you are pulling forward on a rope, the rope is also pulling back on you."	The Sun is pulling on Earth. So, Newton's third law tells you that Earth is pulling on the Sun.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that any force exerted on a body will create a force of equal magnitude but in the opposite direction on the object that exerted the first force. Therefore, if the Sun is pulling on the Earth, the Earth is also pulling on the Sun in response. Hence, the correct choice is 0."

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy to turn water and carbon dioxide into sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Producers don't usually eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts. Chloroplasts are cell parts where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain chlorophyll, which is green. Chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight to power photosynthesis.
They use the sugars they make during photosynthesis as food. This food provides the organisms with the energy they need to live."	"This organism is photosynthetic:
The text tells you that bearberry plants use energy from sunlight to make food. This is evidence that the bearberry plant is a photosynthetic organism.
This organism is not photosynthetic:
The text does not provide evidence that the polar bear is photosynthetic."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text indicates that bearberry plants use energy from sunlight to make food. This is a clear description of photosynthesis, a process only carried out by photosynthetic organisms. On the contrary, polar bears, as stated in the text, hunt seals for food, which suggests they are not photosynthetic. Therefore, the answer is 1, bearberry plants."

Arms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly."	"Look at the picture of the sugar glider.
The sugar glider can spread its patagium like a wing. This helps it glide through the air from the higher branches of one tree to the lower branches of another tree.

The Sumatran orangutan has long limbs but no patagium. Its limbs are not adapted for gliding. The Sumatran orangutan uses its limbs to climb trees."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The Malayan colugo is the correct answer because, like the sugar glider, it also has a patagium stretched between its arms and legs. This adaptation allows the Malayan colugo to glide through the air from tree to tree. On the other hand, the Sumatran orangutan, though it has long limbs, does not have a patagium, and its limbs are used for climbing trees, not gliding."

	Select the part whose main job is to store nutrients, water, and waste in a plant cell.	['Golgi', 'chromosomes', 'nucleus', 'vacuole']	3		closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Cells	Identify functions of plant cell parts	"Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts."	The vacuole stores water, waste, and nutrients such as sugar. Plant cells usually have one vacuole.	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The vacuole is an organelle in a plant cell whose main job is to store nutrients, water, and waste materials. It acts as a storage unit, playing a crucial role in maintaining the cell's internal environment. The other options like Golgi, chromosomes and nucleus perform different roles. The Golgi apparatus is involved in protein sorting, chromosomes carry genetic information, and the nucleus controls the cell's activities."

The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to peel a banana is 13 seconds.
13 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Peeling a banana is a quick and simple task which generally takes only a few seconds. An estimate of 13 seconds is much more reasonable and realistic compared to 13 hours.

In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have thorns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. The question tells you that the R allele, which is for having thorns, is dominant over the r allele, which is for not having thorns.
Having thorns is the dominant allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the thorns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the thorns gene. So, offspring that have thorns must have the genotype RR or Rr.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr.
Not having thorns is the recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the thorns trait must have only recessive alleles for the thorns gene. So, offspring that do not have thorns must have the genotype rr.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype rr.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have thorns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have thorns."	"ANSWER: (2) 0:4
SOLUTION: The task involves reading the given Punnett square and determining the ratio of offspring with the dominant trait (having thorns) to offspring with the recessive trait (not having thorns). As per the information, no boxes in the Punnett square have the dominant genotype (RR or Rr), which signifies offspring with thorns. However, all four boxes have the recessive genotype (rr), which signifies offspring without thorns. Hence, the expected ratio is 0:4."

Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The scar on Henry's left knee is an acquired trait, not an inherited one. This is because scars are usually the result of some form of injury or accident, not something that can be passed down from parent to child through genes. Therefore, it is an environmental influence, not a genetic one."

Since peril is between the guide words paper - porch, it would be found on that page."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding alphabetical order. Guide words on a dictionary page indicate the first and last words on that page.

['umbrella', 'baseball cap', 'caramel sauce', 'stone statue']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"Caramel sauce is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour caramel sauce into a container, the caramel sauce will take the shape of that container. But the caramel sauce will still take up the same amount of space.

A baseball cap is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. If you put a baseball cap on your head, the baseball cap will still have a size and shape of its own."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ""caramel sauce"" because it is the only liquid among the choices given. Liquids take the shape of the container they are in, unlike solids which maintain their own shape. The other choices - umbrella, baseball cap, and stone statue - are all solids, not liquids."

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, dust. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: (2) future tense
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Kirk will dust off the shelf with a rag"" uses the future tense. This is identified by the use of the auxiliary verb ""will"" before the main verb ""dust"". In English grammar, the use of ""will"" before a verb typically indicates an action that will take place in the future. Therefore, the sentence is talking about something Kirk is going to do, not something he is doing now or has done in the past."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3

Costs are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.
Benefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need."	"This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Stacy wants or needs:
Stacy will spend more time walking to the meerkats. They are on the other side of the zoo, but the monkeys are close by."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The second choice is considered as a cost because it involves Stacy sacrificing something that she values - her time. She will have to spend more time walking to see the meerkats since they are located further away in the zoo. This could potentially limit the number of other animals she can see, especially given the impending zoo closing time. Thus, this choice represents a cost to Stacy."
	"Which tense does the sentence use?

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in present tense. You can tell because it uses a present-tense verb, manages. The verb ends in -s and tells you about something that is true or happening now.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mrs. Hatfield manages the busy office"" is in the present tense. This is determined by the verb ""manages"" which is in its present form. In English, the present tense is often indicated by the base form of the verb with an -s ending (for third-person singular subjects), which is the case here. Thus, the sentence describes an action that is currently happening or a general truth."

On a snowy day, Candice rode her sled down a big hill."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Kinetic and potential energy	Identify changes in gravitational potential energy	"Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Candice started sledding. As Candice rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Candice rode down the hill."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The gravitational potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its height or distance from the centre of the Earth. As Candice rode her sled down the hill, the height or distance from the Earth's centre decreased, hence the gravitational potential energy also decreased. Therefore, the correct choice is 1."

However, Ms. Stafford only claimed that students should be allowed to take statistics instead of algebra. She did not suggest that algebra is a useless subject. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text misrepresents Ms. Stafford's suggestion of allowing students to take statistics instead of algebra as her declaring algebra a useless subject.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. The volume of Jupiter is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 8.27 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than ten times as large as Saturn's volume."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The statement is false. When comparing the volumes of Jupiter and Saturn, it is found that the volume of Jupiter (1.43 x 10^15 km^3) is not more than ten times the volume of Saturn (8.27 x 10^15 km^3). Therefore, the claim that Jupiter's volume is more than ten times as large as Saturn's volume is incorrect."

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	Getting a haircut is a physical change. Your hair is shorter after a haircut. But it is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ""physical change"". When you get a haircut, the structure of the hairâ€”its lengthâ€”changes, but not its chemical composition. The hair is still made up of the same proteins and other compounds before and after the haircut. Thus, this is a physical change, not a chemical one."
	Compare the motion of two gray whales. Which gray whale was moving at a higher speed?	['a gray whale that moved 50miles in 10hours', 'a gray whale that moved 20miles in 10hours']	0		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each gray whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One gray whale moved 50 miles in 10 hours.
The other gray whale moved 20 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each gray whale spent the same amount of time moving. The gray whale that moved 50 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that gray whale must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by the distance it covers over a given period of time. In this case, both whales traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours), but the first whale covered a greater distance (50 miles) than the second one (20 miles). Therefore, the first whale - choice 0 - was moving at a higher speed."

It is made by a living thing.', 'Muscovite is a pure substance. It is not made by living things.']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"

Muscovite is a mineral.
A sunflower seed is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
A sunflower seed is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, a sunflower seed is not a mineral."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A sunflower seed is not a mineral because it is not a pure substance and it is made by a living thing. Minerals are pure substances that are formed in nature and are not made by living things. Therefore, unlike native gold and muscovite, a sunflower seed does not possess the properties of a mineral."

All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The statement that ""The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1"" is true because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than in Pair 2. According to physics, the farther apart two magnets are, the weaker the magnetic force between them becomes. Therefore, the closer proximity of the magnets in Pair 2 means a stronger magnetic force than in Pair 1."

The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a black body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a black body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a gray body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a black body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A black body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a black body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a black body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a gray body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a black body."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The Punnett square provided indicates that all offspring will have the genotype BB or Bb, which means they will all have a gray body. The dominant allele (B) for a gray body is present in all offspring, and as the question states, this allele is dominant over the recessive allele (b) for a black body. Therefore, the ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a black body is 4:0, thus the answer is 0."

['It eats a producer.', 'It makes its own food.', 'It eats a primary consumer.']	2	This diagram shows a food chain from a grassland ecosystem in Wyoming.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Ecosystems	Identify roles in food chains	"Every organism needs food to stay alive. Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!"	In this food chain, the deer mouse is a secondary consumer because it eats a primary consumer. The primary consumer in this food chain is the katydid.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: In a food chain, a secondary consumer is an organism that eats primary consumers. Primary consumers are organisms that eat producers or plants. If the deer mouse is a secondary consumer, it means it eats primary consumers. Hence, the right answer is ""It eats a primary consumer""."

['4:0', '0:4', '2:2', '3:1', '1:3']	2	"This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the G allele, which is for climbing growth, is dominant over the g allele, which is for bush growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The text explains that the Punnett square shows two boxes with the genotype GG or Gg, which corresponds to climbing growth, and two boxes with the genotype gg, which corresponds to bush growth. As climbing growth is dominant, it can be represented by either GG or Gg, while bush growth, being recessive, can only be represented by gg. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2, which corresponds to choice 2."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each blue jay moved and the time it took to move that distance.

SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by dividing the distance travelled by time taken. Here, both blue jays have taken the same amount of time i.e. 5 hours. The blue jay that travelled 180 kilometers in 5 hours has a lower speed than the one that travelled 190 kilometers in the same time frame.

The only arrow pointing to the black rockfish starts from the zooplankton. The only arrow pointing to the zooplankton starts from the phytoplankton. No arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the black rockfish.
There are two arrows pointing to the plainfin midshipman. These start from the phytoplankton and the zooplankton. The only arrow pointing to the zooplankton starts from the phytoplankton. No arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the plainfin midshipman.
No arrow points to the phytoplankton. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp to the phytoplankton.There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the kelp bass: kelp->kelp bass."	"ANSWER: (2) kelp bass
SOLUTION: The explanation provided clearly maps out the paths of matter in the food web from the kelp to the other organisms. The only organism that matter moves directly from the kelp to is the kelp bass, as indicated by the path ""kelp->kelp bass"". Thus, the kelp bass is the only organism in the options given that contains matter that was once part of the kelp."
	Select the elementary substance.	['cyclopropane (C3H6)', 'argon (Ar)', 'phosphine (PH3)']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Identify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for cyclopropane contains two symbols: C for carbon and H for hydrogen. So, cyclopropane is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, cyclopropane is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for phosphine contains two symbols: P for phosphorus and H for hydrogen. So, phosphine is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, phosphine is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for argon contains one symbol: Ar. So, argon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, argon is an elementary substance.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The elementary substance among the choices is argon (Ar). This is because an elementary substance is a substance that is made up of only one type of atom. Argon (Ar) is an elementary substance because it is made up of only argon atoms. On the other hand, cyclopropane (C3H6) and phosphine (PH3) are made up of more than one type of atom, making them compounds, not elementary substances."
	Which metal paper clip has a lower temperature?	['the metal paper clip with less thermal energy', 'the metal paper clip with more thermal energy']	0	Two metal paper clips are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two metal paper clips are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the metal paper clip with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The temperature of an object is directly related to its thermal energy. This means that if an object has more thermal energy, it would also have a higher temperature. Similarly, if a metal paper clip has less thermal energy, its temperature would be lower. Since the two metal paper clips are identical except for their thermal energy, the one with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature."

"	"A western gull's scientific name is Larus occidentalis. The first word of its scientific name is Larus.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Larus occidentalis are not in the same genus.
Polysticta stelleri is in the genus Polysticta. The first word of its scientific name is Polysticta. So, Polysticta stelleri and Larus occidentalis are not in the same genus.
Larus michahellis is in the genus Larus. The first word of its scientific name is Larus. So, Larus michahellis and Larus occidentalis are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The western gull's scientific name is Larus occidentalis, where 'Larus' is the genus name. The first choice, Larus michahellis, also has 'Larus' as the genus name.

One friend sits in the wagon at a time.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the friend who is heavier.
A friend who weighs 32 pounds is heavier than a friend who weighs 31 pounds. So, to move the wagon at the same speed each time, Ruben needs to use a larger force to start moving the wagon with a friend who weighs 32 pounds."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The force required to move an object is directly proportional to the mass of the object. In this case, the mass of the friend is equivalent to their weight. Therefore, the heavier friend would require a larger force to move at the same speed. In the given choices, the friend who weighs 32 pounds is heavier than the one who weighs 31 pounds.

['a solid', 'a gas', 'a liquid']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a stick in half is a physical change. The stick gets broken into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the original stick.

Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (3)
SOLUTION: Breaking a stick in half and mixing sand and gravel are both physical changes because they do not alter the chemical composition of the substances involved.

The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Ace is a cow from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Ace's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa, meaning he carries one allele for solid coloring (A) and one for white spots (a). However, the information suggests that the allele for solid coloring is dominant over the allele for white spots, which is recessive. Therefore, since Ace carries at least one dominant allele (A), his phenotype will show the trait for solid coloring, making choice 1 the correct answer."

Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The scar on Nina's right leg is an acquired trait. This is because scars are not passed down through genes, but are a result of physical injury or damage to the skin. They are caused by environmental factors and experiences during a person's life. This makes them an acquired trait, not an inherited one."

A metaphor compares two things that are not actually alike without using like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town."	"The text uses a metaphor, comparing two things that are not actually alike without using like or as.
The metaphor Tanvi felt a roller coaster of emotions suggests that Tanvi had varied feelings. A roller coaster has a dramatic mix of ups and downs, and so do Tanvi's feelings."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The metaphor 'a roller coaster of emotions' is used to signify a range of varied emotions Tanvi felt after hearing the news. Just like a roller coaster ride has many ups and downs, this metaphor indicates that Tanvi's feelings were also changing rapidly, experiencing highs and lows. Therefore, the answer is not that Tanvi felt delighted about the news, but that she had varied feelings."

['white spots', 'solid coloring']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a).
Chuck is a cow from this group. Chuck has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Chuck's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Chuck's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Chuck's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa, which means he has one dominant allele (A) and one recessive allele (a). In genetic traits, the presence of a dominant allele always overrides the recessive allele. Therefore, despite having one recessive allele, Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is determined by the dominant allele, which is solid coloring."

So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether Gilligan's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Gilligan's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Gilliganâ€™s genotype is ee, meaning he carries two alleles for the same trait, which in this case is the eye color. The allele for black eyes is recessive, represented by 'e'. Since Gilligan carries two 'e' alleles, his phenotype, which is the physical representation of his genotype, would be black eyes. Thus, the correct answer is 'black eyes'."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. Them has been replaced with city officials.
The neighborhood association wants city officials to provide more affordable housing."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The pronoun ""them"" in option 0 does not clearly point out to whom it is referring. It can be city officials, developers, or any other group. This makes the pronoun reference vague. On the other hand, in option 1, ""city officials"" is clearly specified, making it the more clear and precise sentence."

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 5 hours. The bicycle that moved 135 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by the distance it travels divided by the time it took to travel that distance. All three bicycles traveled for the same amount of time, which is 5 hours. Therefore, the bicycle that covered the most distance, 135 kilometers, was moving at the highest speed. Hence, the answer is 2."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The given situation presents two magnets with their south poles facing each other. From the fundamental understanding of magnetism, similar poles (i.e., south-south or north-north) repel each other while opposite poles attract each other. Therefore, in this case, the magnets will repel each other."

['the male part', 'the female part']	0	This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Angiosperm and conifer life cycles	"Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again."	"The male part of the flower makes pollen. The anthers, which are part of the stamen, produce pollen.
The female part of the flower makes eggs, not pollen."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The male part of the flower, specifically the stamen, is responsible for producing pollen. This is a fundamental aspect of plant reproduction, where the pollen is transferred from the male part to the female part of the flower. The female part, the pistil, is responsible for producing eggs, not pollen. Therefore, the correct answer is option 0."

The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.

50 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The process of draining a full bathtub is typically quick, taking only a few minutes. Draining a bathtub in 50 hours is not feasible as it would imply a very slow flow rate. On the other hand, 50 seconds might be a bit fast, but it is a much better estimate than 50 hours. Therefore, the better estimate is 50 seconds."

A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,

Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
â€”From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
â€”From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.

dust settling out of the air
melting wax"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The answer choice ""Both are only physical changes"" is selected because both the changes mentioned - dust settling out of the air and melting wax - do not involve a transformation into a new substance. These changes can be reversed and the original substance can be obtained. Hence, they are physical changes, not chemical changes. Neither of the changes is caused by heating or cooling specifically, hence option 3 is the correct answer."

Figure: queen scallop."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: skins and body coverings	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators."	"Look at the picture of the queen scallop.
The queen scallop has a hard outer shell. Its body is adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth. The hard shell makes it difficult for predators to hurt or kill the queen scallop.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The marsh terrapin has a hard outer shell. Its body is adapted for protection against a predator with sharp teeth.
The ring-necked pheasant has soft feathers covering its skin. Its body is not adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The marsh terrapin is the correct answer because it has a hard outer shell that it can pull its body into when under threat, similar to the queen scallop. This adaptation makes it better protected against predators with sharp teeth. On the other hand, the ring-necked pheasant has soft feathers, which do not offer the same level of protection against these types of predators."

Cracks forming in concrete due to changes in temperature is a ()."	['chemical change', 'physical change']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Cracks forming in concrete due to changes in temperature is a physical change. The concrete looks different, but it is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the formation of cracks in concrete due to changes in temperature represents a physical change, not a chemical one. Physical changes refer to changes in the size, shape, location, or state of a matter without a change in its type. Despite the formation of cracks, the concrete remains the same substance - it has not chemically reacted or transformed into a new substance."
	Which is a run-on sentence?	"[""He won't get lost, I will give him directions."", 'Goes on a big adventure.']"	0		closed choice	grade3	language science	writing-strategies	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is it a complete sentence, a fragment, or a run-on?	"A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It is usually missing a subject or a verb.

The bright red car.
This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a verb.
What did the bright red car do? The bright red car stopped.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside."	He won't get lost, I will give him directions is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined by just a comma: He won't get lost and I will give him directions.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The sentence ""He won't get lost, I will give him directions"" is a run-on sentence. This is because it contains two independent clauses that are incorrectly joined by a comma without a conjunction. This type of error is known as a comma splice, making it a run-on sentence. On the other hand, ""Goes on a big adventure"" is a simple sentence, not a run-on."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
"	The text argues that Candice's claim that the Loch Ness Monster isn't real is not valid because she's not Scottish. This is a personal attack on Candice's background that isn't relevant to whether her claim is valid. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The text discredits Candice's argument about the Loch Ness Monster not being real based on her nationality, that she is not Scottish. This focuses on her personal trait, rather than addressing the argument itself, which is whether the Loch Ness Monster is real or not. This is an example of ad hominem, a logical fallacy where the person making the argument is attacked instead of the argument itself. Therefore, the answer is 2."

	How long does it take to cook a turkey in the oven?	['6 hours', '6 minutes']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to cook a turkey in the oven is 6 hours.
6 minutes is too fast."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The better estimate for how long it takes to cook a turkey in the oven is 6 hours. Cooking a turkey requires a significant amount of time to ensure it is thoroughly cooked and safe to eat. The core temperature of the turkey needs to reach a safe level to kill any bacteria. Thus, 6 minutes is far too short a time for this process, making 6 hours the appropriate choice."
	Which meatball has a higher temperature?	['the meatball with less thermal energy', 'the meatball with more thermal energy']	1	Two meatballs are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two meatballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the meatball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The temperature of an object is directly proportional to its thermal energy. This means that if two objects are identical but have different amounts of thermal energy, the one with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature. This concept applies to the meatballs in the given scenario, so the meatball with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature."

Oliver, a cat from this group, does not have agouti fur. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur (a). So, Oliver's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage mentions that Oliver, a cat, does not have agouti fur. The allele for not having agouti fur is represented by 'a'. Oliver has two of these alleles, hence his genotype for the agouti fur gene is 'aa'. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which represents 'aa'."

In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a dwarf body or a normal-sized body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a dwarf body.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to offspring with a normal-sized body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a dwarf body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a normal-sized body."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The Punnett square indicates the possible genetic combinations resulting from the cross of two individuals. Considering that the allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b), it is observed that there are no bb combinations (which would result in a dwarf body) in the Punnett square. The genotypes BB or Bb (resulting in a normal-sized body) are present in all 4 boxes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to offspring with a normal-sized body is 0:4. This is why option 3 is the correct answer."

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The act of carving a piece of wood and dust settling out of the air are both physical changes. These changes only alter the state or form of the matter, not its identity or chemical composition. Hence, they are not chemical changes and are not caused by either heating or cooling. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Both are only physical changes""."
	Based on this information, what is Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait?	['wavy fur', 'straight fur']	0	"In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Nutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Nutmeg's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nutmeg's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The question asks about Nutmeg's phenotype, which is an observable trait in an organism. From the information given, Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene, which is stated to be recessive and responsible for wavy fur. This means that Nutmeg will have wavy fur, hence, the correct answer is 0."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A slide is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A slide has a size and shape of its own, even when you sit on it."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: A slide is a solid. Solids are characterized by having a definite shape and volume that does not change unless physical forces are applied. A slide fits this description as it maintains its shape and size regardless of the environmental conditions, unlike liquids and gases which take the shape of the container they are in. Thus, the correct choice is option number 2."

The red wolf of the southeastern United States became extinct in the wild in 1980. After scientists created a breeding program with a few red wolves in captivity, the wolves were reintroduced to the wild."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text contains a sentence fragment which is ""After scientists created a breeding program with a few red wolves in captivity."" This sentence is incomplete because it does not express a complete thought and is dependent on another sentence to make sense. To correct this, it should be linked to the preceding sentence or additional information should be provided to make it a complete sentence. Hence, the answer is yes (1), there is a sentence fragment."
	What is the volume of a glass of milk?	['1 gallon', '1 cup', '1 fluid ounce']	1	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a glass of milk is 1 cup.
1 fluid ounce is too little and 1 gallon is too much."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A standard glass of milk typically holds around 1 cup of liquid. One fluid ounce is too small a measurement for a typical glass of milk, as it is equivalent to approximately 2 tablespoons. On the other hand, a gallon is a much larger unit of measurement, typically used to measure larger quantities like the total capacity of a milk jug. Therefore, the best estimate is 1 cup."

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A sand cat's scientific name is Felis margarita.
Felis margarita has the same scientific name as a sand cat. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Neofelis nebulosa does not have the same scientific name as a sand cat. So, Felis margarita and Neofelis nebulosa are not in the same species.
Lynx canadensis does not have the same scientific name as a sand cat. So, Felis margarita and Lynx canadensis are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The scientific name for a sand cat is Felis margarita. Given the options, Felis margarita is the only choice that matches the scientific name of a sand cat. Therefore, Felis margarita is the organism in the same species as the sand cat. The other choices, Lynx canadensis and Neofelis nebulosa, are not in the same species as they have different scientific names."

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for a hairy fleece, and the allele f is for a woolly fleece.
Thistle, a sheep from this group, has a hairy fleece. Thistle has two alleles for a hairy fleece."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Thistle's observable version of the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece. So, Thistle's phenotype for the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The question asks for Thistle's phenotype regarding the fleece type trait. The text clearly states that Thistle has a hairy fleece. A phenotype is an observable characteristic or trait of an organism, in this case, the type of fleece Thistle has. Therefore, the correct answer is ""a hairy fleece""."

The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Sword of Damocles is ancient legend.
According to legend, when Damocles wished his life were as full of luxuries as that of the tyrant Dionysis, Dionysis invited Damocles to a sumptuous banquet. Above Damocles' seat at the feast, Dionysis had placed a sword, suspended only by a thin hair, demonstrating the fragile nature of fortune.
The allusion Sword of Damocles means a reminder that one is vulnerable."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ancient legend. This is because the phrase ""Sword of Damocles"" is a reference to a Greek legend about Damocles, a courtier of a tyrant named Dionysis. In the story, Damocles is made to realize that his position of power and wealth is precarious, symbolized by a sword hanging above his head, suspended by a single hair.

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each goose moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each goose moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each goose moved for 10 hours. The goose that moved 650 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that goose must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken. In this case, all three geese travelled for the same amount of time, 10 hours.

Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion We're not in Kansas anymore is a movie.
In the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy, a young farm girl from Kansas, finds herself in Oz, an unusual place that looks nothing like her home. She says to her dog, ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.""
The allusion We're not in Kansas anymore means we're in an unfamiliar place."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phrase ""We're not in Kansas anymore"" is a popular quote from the 1939 movie ""The Wizard of Oz"". The character Dorothy Gale, transported from her home in Kansas to the fantastical land of Oz, uses this phrase to express her feeling of not being in a familiar place. Thus, when Alexa uses this phrase, she's alluding to this movie, indicating she and her companion are in a place that's vastly different from what they're accustomed to. Hence, the source of the allusion is a movie."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	"[""As Brad's train pulled out of the station, Ted waved goodbye to him."", 'Ted waved goodbye to Brad as his train pulled out of the station.']"	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A Grevy's zebra's scientific name is Equus grevyi.
Cervus canadensis does not have the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, Equus grevyi and Cervus canadensis are not in the same species.
Macropus rufus does not have the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, Equus grevyi and Macropus rufus are not in the same species.
Equus grevyi has the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The question asks to select the organism in the same species as the Grevy's zebra. The scientific name for the Grevy's zebra is Equus grevyi. Therefore, the organism that is in the same species as the Grevy's zebra is the one that also has the scientific name Equus grevyi. Thus, the correct choice is 2."

From the look on her face, Camille is carrying an albatross around her neck."	['a poem', 'Egyptian history']	0		closed choice	grade12	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion an albatross around her neck is a poem.
In Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" a sailor shoots and kills an albatross, an action that curses the ship and crew. As his crew members die, the Ancient Mariner feels his guilt hanging like the albatross around his neck.
The allusion an albatross around her neck means a burden a person must bear."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phrase ""an albatross around her neck"" is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."" In this poem, an albatross is killed and becomes a symbol of guilt and burden for the mariner who killed it. This is why the phrase has come to mean a weight or burden that one must carry, often due to a mistake or guilt. Hence, the correct answer is a poem, not Egyptian history."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
acid rain weathering a marble statue
chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a chemical change. When the flashlight is turned on, the chemicals in the battery react with each other to form new chemicals. This creates electricity, which powers the lightbulb.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both the examples given - acid rain weathering a marble statue and chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight - are instances of chemical changes. In both cases, there is a reaction that results in new substances forming. This means that the original substances - the marble and the chemicals in the battery - have transformed into something new. Hence, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

['bat bones', 'air inside a raft', 'pair of dice', 'water in a fishbowl']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A pair of dice is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you roll a pair of dice, the dice have a shape of their own. They are still cubes when they stop rolling.
The air inside a raft is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a raft expands to fill all the space inside the raft. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the raft.
A bat bone is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A bat bone has its own shape inside the bat.
The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour water from a fishbowl into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The question asks to identify a gas from the given choices. In the case of the air inside a raft, it is a gas as it expands to fill all the space inside the raft. The other choices are either solids or liquids. Solids have a definite shape and size, and liquids take the shape of their containers. Therefore, the correct answer is the air inside a raft."

A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether a drum is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a drum something you can touch? Yes.
Is a drum a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a drum is a good."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A drum is a tangible object, which can be touched, bought, or sold, hence it is classified as a 'good'. Goods are physical commodities or products which are used to satisfy wants and needs. On the other hand, a service is an intangible act or function which can't be touched but is performed to serve a specific purpose or satisfy a need, which a drum doesn't fulfill.

But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A great gray owl's scientific name is Strix nebulosa.
Goura scheepmakeri does not have the same scientific name as a great gray owl. So, Strix nebulosa and Goura scheepmakeri are not in the same species.
Strix nebulosa has the same scientific name as a great gray owl. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Goura victoria does not have the same scientific name as a great gray owl. So, Strix nebulosa and Goura victoria are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The great gray owl's scientific name is Strix nebulosa. The organism in the same species should have the same scientific name. Among the given choices, only Strix nebulosa matches the scientific name of the great gray owl. Therefore, the organism in the same species as the great gray owl is Strix nebulosa."

"	The text argues that running shoes aren't good for your feet because our ancient ancestors did not wear running shoes. However, running shoes are not necessarily bad for your feet just because our ancient ancestors did not naturally have them in the past. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text uses the appeal to nature fallacy. This is evident in the assumption that running with bare feet is better just because that is how our ancient ancestors did it. It suggests that just because something is natural or was done in the past, it is inherently better, which is not necessarily the case. This fallacy dismisses the possible benefits that advancement in technology, like running shoes, could provide."

If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

	"What do these two changes have in common?
making paper from wood
rust forming on a metal gate"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Making paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both 'making paper from wood' and 'rust forming on a metal gate' involve changes in the chemical composition of the substances. In both cases, the original substances are transformed into new substances with different properties. So, they are not merely physical changes, nor are they caused by heating or cooling. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

SOLUTION: In the English language, a closed syllable is one where a single vowel is followed by at least one consonant, resulting in a short vowel sound. On the other hand, an open syllable ends with a vowel which typically has a long vowel sound. The word 'we' ends with a vowel sound and does not have a consonant following it, thus it forms an open syllable, not a closed one.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000

crushing a mineral into powder"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both carving a piece of wood and crushing a mineral into powder are physical changes. These actions only modify the shape or form of the matter but do not alter its inherent chemical properties. Therefore, they are not chemical changes. Also, these changes are not caused by heating or cooling."
	Select the liquid.	['crayons', 'slide', 'dish soap', 'coins']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A coin is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. Many coins are made of solid metal.
A crayon is a solid. You can break a crayon into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.
Dish soap is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour dish soap out of a bottle, the dish soap will change shape. But the dish soap will still take up the same amount of space.
A slide is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A slide has a size and shape of its own, even when you sit on it."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task required identifying the liquid among the given choices. A liquid is a state of matter that takes the shape of its container and maintains a nearly fixed volume. Among the options, dish soap is a liquid, as it changes its shape according to the container it is in. Crayons, slides, and coins, on the other hand, are solids as they maintain their shape and volume regardless of their container."

O happy dagger is a direct address to the dagger, a nonhuman entity."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text uses the figure of speech called apostrophe. In the quote, Juliet speaks directly to the dagger, a nonhuman entity, which is a characteristic of apostrophe. This is not a euphemism, as there is no indirect or softer expression used to replace a harsh or blunt one. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, apostrophe."

	"Which tense does the sentence use?
Edwin will make cookies with his friends."	['present tense', 'past tense', 'future tense']	2		closed choice	grade5	language science	verbs	Verb tense	Is the sentence in the past, present, or future tense?	"Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.

	Which text uses the word terribly in its traditional sense?	['Raymond shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.', 'Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.']	1		closed choice	grade12	language science	writing-strategies	Word usage and nuance	Explore words with new or contested usages	"Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.

David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Raymond shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The choice 1 ""Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent."" uses the term 'terribly' in its traditional sense, meaning 'in a terrible manner'. Here, it intensifies the verb 'shivered', suggesting that Raymond was shivering in a severe or extreme manner. On the other hand, the first text uses 'terribly' to intensify the adjective 'steep', which is a non-traditional usage of the word."

['Ardea herodias', 'Falco tinnunculus', 'Ardea cinerea']	1	This organism is an American kestrel. Its scientific name is Falco sparverius.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Classification and scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"An American kestrel's scientific name is Falco sparverius. The first word of its scientific name is Falco.
Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea cinerea and Falco sparverius are not in the same genus.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Falco sparverius are not in the same genus.
Falco tinnunculus is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco tinnunculus and Falco sparverius are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The American kestrel's scientific name is Falco sparverius, which indicates that it belongs to the Falco genus. Falco tinnunculus also belongs to the Falco genus, as indicated by its scientific name. Therefore, Falco tinnunculus is the organism in the same genus as the American kestrel. The other options, Ardea herodias and Ardea cinerea, belong to the Ardea genus and therefore are not in the same genus as the American kestrel."

Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 5 hours. The motorboat that moved 280 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The speed of the motorboat is calculated by the distance travelled divided by the time taken. All the motorboats were moving for the same amount of time i.e., 5 hours. The first motorboat travelled the farthest distance of 280 kilometers in that time span. Hence, it was moving at the highest speed. The direction of movement does not affect the speed."

"Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea and the rotifer. The water flea are the rotifer are both primary consumers, so the black crappie is a secondary consumer.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a primary consumer, so the copepod is a secondary consumer.
The golden algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer.
The green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The black crappie is a secondary consumer in the given food web. This is because it has arrows pointing to it from primary consumers, which means it consumes them. In contrast, the golden algae and the green algae do not have any arrows pointing to them, indicating that they are not secondary consumers. Therefore, the answer is 1, the black crappie."

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The solution provided indicates that the size of the magnets affects the magnitude of the magnetic force, with larger magnets having a greater force. While the magnets in Pair 1 repel and those in Pair 2 attract, this affects only the direction and not the magnitude of the force. As Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1, leading to answer choice 2."

Megan wanted her daughter to have a unique name, so she browsed baby name websites for months to find the perfect one.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The term 'unique' is used in the second text to describe a hand-knitted romper that Megan designed herself. This use of the term aligns with its traditional meaning, which refers to something being the only one of its kind. In the first text, 'unique' is used to describe a name that Megan sought from a website, which could potentially be used by others, and therefore does not strictly align with the traditional definition of 'unique'."

Jupiter, a leopard from this group, has a black coat. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat (a). So, Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The question asks for Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene. According to the information provided, Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat (a). In terms of genotype representation, each allele is represented by a letter and since Jupiter has two of the same allele (a), his genotype is 'aa'.

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

48 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The better estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank is 48 liters. This is because a typical car gas tank can hold anywhere between 45 to 65 liters of fuel. 48 milliliters is far too small to be the volume of a car's gas tank, as it is less than the volume of a single soda can. Therefore, the correct choice is 48 liters."

SOLUTION: Gravitational potential energy depends on the height of an object from the Earth's surface. When the water balloon is dropped from the balcony, it is moving closer to the Earth's surface, hence its height is decreasing. As the height decreases, the gravitational potential energy decreases as well.

SOLUTION: The gravitational potential energy depends on the height above the ground or the distance from the center of the Earth. As the balloon falls, this distance decreases, which leads to a decrease in gravitational potential energy. This is because the formula for gravitational potential energy is mass times gravity times height (mgh), and if height decreases, so does the potential energy.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Firing clay is caused by heating. But a penny tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Both a penny tarnishing and firing a clay pot in a hot kiln are examples of chemical changes. In both cases, the initial substances are changed into new substances with different properties. Tarnishing of a penny is caused by reaction with oxygen in the air, while firing a clay pot in a kiln causes the clay to harden and change its properties. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As tidy as an overgrown garden shows verbal irony because an overgrown garden is not tidy."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The figure of speech used in the text ""Jason's room is as tidy as an overgrown garden"" is verbal irony. This is because, while the statement implies that Jason's room is tidy, the comparison to an overgrown garden, which is typically messy and unkempt, suggests the opposite. Thus, the statement is ironic because it says one thing but implies something very different."

Earth is the largest planet that is made mainly of rock."	['true', 'false']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
"	The table tells you that Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars are the planets made mainly of rock. Of these planets, Earth has the volume with the largest exponent. So, Earth is the largest planet that is made mainly of rock.	"ANSWER: 0

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task requires understanding the properties of magnets, specifically that like poles repel each other. The hint mentions that the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other, indicating they are like poles. Therefore, based on the property of magnets, these two magnets will repel each other. Hence, the correct answer is '0' which represents 'repel'."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

"Without an accompanying diagram or specific numbers given, it's impossible to provide an exact answer in numerical format. However, based on the solution explanation, it suggests that Solution A has higher concentration of green particles. 

SOLUTION: The solution text explains that to determine which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, one must look at both the number of green particles and the volume of solvent in each container. Using the concentration formula, one can find the number of green particles per milliliter. The solution text states that Solution A has more green particles per milliliter, so Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles. Therefore, the answer is (2) Solution A."

Figure 2: sediment deposited in a desert.
Over thousands of years, the river dried up, and the area became a desert. In the desert, sediment was deposited by wind."	closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	How do rock layers form?	"Material that is carried by wind, water, or ice is called sediment. Sediment may be deposited, or laid down, in places such as deserts and the ocean floor. Different types of sediment are deposited in different environments. For example, sand may be deposited in a desert, and mud may be deposited at the bottom of the ocean.
The environment of an area can change over thousands of years. When the environment changes, the type of sediment that is deposited also changes. Over a long period of time, different layers of sediment can build up in the same area. These layers preserve a record of the environments that existed in that area in the past.
As many layers of sediment build up, they can be pressed together to form layers of sedimentary rock. A series of rock layers is called a rock sequence. You can observe the layers of a rock sequence to learn more about how an area's environment changed over time."	"The environment in the area changed over time. Use the pictures to figure out the type of sediment deposited in each environment.
Later, the area became a desert. A layer of sand was deposited by wind."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text implies that over time, the sediment in the area changed from being heavy sediment grains deposited by a fast-flowing river to a layer of sand deposited by wind when the area became a desert. Therefore, we can infer that the heavy sediment (possibly composed of sand and pebbles) was deposited first, followed by a layer of sand, confirming choice 0."

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Buck has two alleles for white spots (a). So, Buck's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Buck's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. This is stated in the hint where it says that Buck has two alleles for white spots, and in this case, the allele for white spots is represented as 'a'. Therefore, having two of these alleles translates to a genotype of 'aa'. This is further supported by the provided solution that clarifies that an organism's genotype is its combination of alleles for a particular gene."

['On Nov. 19, musicians from all over town will battle it out in the fourth annual Jam-a-thon, happening at the amphitheater.', 'On November 19, the Middletown Amphitheater will host area musicians vying for top honors in the fourth annual Jam-a-thon.']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Audience, purpose, and tone	Which text is most formal?	"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The second press release is more formal. It uses more elevated language (area musicians, top honors). The other press release uses idioms (battle it out) and abbreviations (Nov.).	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The second press release is more formal due to its choice of language. It avoids the use of informal expressions such as ""battle it out"", opting instead for a more professional term like ""vying"". It also uses the full name of the month (November) rather than an abbreviation. The overall tone of the second press release is more professional and formal."
	"Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
Zack swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin."	['simile', 'metaphor']	0		closed choice	grade5	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"Zack swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin.
The words Zack and dolphin are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Zack swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin."" uses a simile. This is deduced from the fact that the comparison between Zack's swimming and a dolphin is made using the word 'like'. In similes, comparisons are often made with the words 'like' or 'as'. Therefore, the correct choice is simile, which is represented by the number 0."

['South America', 'Asia', 'Africa']	2		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0Â° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180Â°E and 180Â°W.

It is no longer used because it can be dangerous to humans.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of chloroform is composed of one hydrogen atom, one carbon atom, and three chlorine atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that chloroform is composed of three chemical elements: hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine. Since chloroform is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, chloroform is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Chloroform is a compound because it is composed of more than one type of atom bonded together. As the model shows, a molecule of chloroform consists of hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine. Thus, it cannot be an elementary substance, which is made up of only one type of atom. The presence of multiple types of atoms makes chloroform a compound."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The strength of a magnetic force is dependent on the proximity of the magnets. If magnets are closer, the force is stronger. Since Pair 1's magnets are closer together compared to Pair 2, the magnetic force between them is stronger. Therefore, the correct choice is (2) The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1."

However, there is some truth to it: it is more hurtful when your friend does something to wrong you than when your enemy does, making it harder to forgive the person close to you."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text presents a paradox because it states a seemingly contradictory idea that, upon further thought, contains truth. The statement ""It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend"" seems contradictory because usually, we would expect it to be easier to forgive a friend than an enemy. However, the depth of the betrayal felt when a friend wrongs us can make forgiveness more difficult, hence revealing the truth in the paradox."

A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of sulfur dioxide is composed of two oxygen atoms and one sulfur atom bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that sulfur dioxide is composed of two chemical elements: oxygen and sulfur. Since sulfur dioxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sulfur dioxide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Sulfur dioxide is a compound because it consists of more than one type of element, which are sulfur and oxygen. An elementary substance consists of only one type of atom, which sulfur dioxide does not. Therefore, based on the information provided and the chemical composition of sulfur dioxide, it is a compound."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

['acquired', 'inherited']	0	Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Scars are not genetically passed down from parents to their offspring, hence they are not inherited traits. They are typically the result of an injury or damage to the skin. Therefore, they are considered acquired traits since they occur during a person's lifetime and are not determined by their genes. In Carrie's case, the scar on her right hand is an acquired trait."

Birdie, a chicken from this group, has white legs. Birdie has one allele for white legs and one allele for yellow legs."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Birdie has one allele for white legs (L) and one allele for yellow legs (l). So, Birdie's genotype for the leg color gene is Ll.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The genotype of an organism is the set of genes it carries for a certain trait. In Birdie's case, she carries one allele for white legs (L) and one allele for yellow legs (l). Thus, her genotype for leg color is represented as Ll, which corresponds to choice 0. Choice 1, 'white legs', refers to the phenotype (observable characteristics), not the genotype."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian.

Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct choice is 1. The statement is true because the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. This is due to the fact that the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is smaller than in Pair 2. The magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets is directly affected by the distance between them, with a smaller distance leading to a greater force."

But a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream comes with a free waffle cone.	closed choice	grade5	social science	economics	Basic economic principles	Costs and benefits	"Before you decide to do something, it is often helpful to list costs and benefits.
Costs are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.
Benefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need."	"This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Ted wants or needs:
Ted will give up the chance to get a free waffle cone. He would have enjoyed the waffle cone."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The cost in this situation is what Ted is giving up by choosing the pumpkin spice ice cream over the vanilla bean ice cream. While he prefers the flavor of the pumpkin spice ice cream, by choosing it, he will miss out on the opportunity to receive a free waffle cone that he would have enjoyed. Therefore, the cost is associated with the missed opportunity, which is option 1."

A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body."	"A ladybug is an insect. Like other insects, a ladybug is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
A woodpecker is a bird. Like other birds, a woodpecker is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
A red-headed poison frog is an amphibian. Like other amphibians, a red-headed poison frog is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
A wombat is a mammal. Like other mammals, a wombat is a vertebrate. It has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The ladybug is the correct answer as it is an insect and insects are invertebrates. Invertebrates are animals that do not possess a backbone or spinal column. The other options, the woodpecker, the red-headed poison frog, and the wombat are all vertebrates as they belong to birds, amphibians, and mammals respectively which all have a backbone."
	Which pot of spaghetti sauce has more thermal energy?	['the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce', 'the colder pot of spaghetti sauce']	0	Two pots of spaghetti sauce are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two pots of spaghetti sauce are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to temperature - the higher the temperature, the greater the thermal energy. Therefore, if two pots of spaghetti sauce are identical in every way except for their temperatures, the pot with the higher temperature will have more thermal energy. Hence, the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce has more thermal energy."

An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:

Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.

Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy compared to those in sample B because they have more mass. As kinetic energy is directly proportional to the mass and square of velocity, more mass results in higher kinetic energy. Furthermore, the temperature of a substance is directly related to the average kinetic energy of its particles. Hence, sample A has a higher temperature."

Its scientific name is Cyanocitta cristata.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A blue jay's scientific name is Cyanocitta cristata. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta.
Goura cristata and Cyanocitta cristata are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Goura cristata and Cyanocitta cristata have the same species name within their genus, cristata. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Goura cristata is in the genus Goura, and Cyanocitta cristata is in the genus Cyanocitta.
Cyanocitta stelleri is in the genus Cyanocitta. The first word of its scientific name is Cyanocitta. So, Cyanocitta stelleri and Cyanocitta cristata are in the same genus.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Cyanocitta cristata are not in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: In scientific names, the first word represents the genus, while the second one represents the species. The blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata, and Cyanocitta stelleri share the same genus name, Cyanocitta, indicating they're from the same genus. The other two options, Goura cristata and Strix aluco, belong to different genera, Goura and Strix, respectively. Hence, the correct choice is Cyanocitta stelleri."

Liz throws the ball into the hoop."	['past tense', 'future tense', 'present tense']	2		closed choice	grade3	language science	verbs	Verb tense	Is the sentence in the past, present, or future tense?	"Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in present tense. You can tell because it uses a present-tense verb, throws. The verb ends in -s and tells you about something that is true or happening now.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Liz throws the ball into the hoop"" uses the present tense. This is determined by the verb ""throws"", which is in the present tense. The verb ends in -s which is a key indicator of a present tense verb in third person singular. Thus, we can confirm that the action is currently happening or regularly happens, which is a characteristic of the present tense."

A rough object feels scratchy when you touch it. The wet paint and the wet ice cube are not rough.
The property that all three objects have in common is slippery."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The three objects were described as being slippery. Slippery objects are difficult to grab or stand on, which makes this property common to all three objects. In contrast, the other two properties, scratchy and rough, were ruled out because they do not apply to all the objects. Therefore, the common property is that they are all slippery."

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.

Hassan seemed to know a lot about African wildlife, but it turned out that his knowledge was mostly based on factoids gleaned from unreliable websites.
The second text uses factoid in its nontraditional sense: a trivial but true fact.
Hassan subscribed to an online newsletter about African wildlife; he enjoyed receiving daily factoids about the wild animals' natural habitats and behavior.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word factoid because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first text uses the word 'factoid' in its traditional sense, which refers to information that is false or spurious, presented as a fact. This can be understood from the context where Hassan's knowledge about African wildlife is based on 'factoids' from unreliable websites, implying that the information may not be accurate or true. The second text usage of 'factoid' leans more towards its nontraditional sense: a trivial but true fact."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	All three blocks of steel have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 66Â°F block is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object has. In this case, all three objects have the same mass, but the 3-kilogram block of steel at 66Â°F has the lowest temperature. Therefore, it has the least thermal energy."
	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Sophia has a scar on her left ankle."	['inherited', 'acquired']	1	Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The scar on Sophia's left ankle is an acquired trait. This is because scars are formed as a result of injury or surgery and are not genetically passed down from parents to their offspring. Such traits that are not genetically determined but are learnt or developed from the environment or personal experiences are categorized as acquired traits. Therefore, Sophia's scar is an acquired trait, not inherited."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
butter melting on a hot day
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The two changes described - butter melting on a hot day and sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle - are both physical changes. This is because the properties of the substances have changed but their chemical composition remains the same. The butter has changed from a solid to a liquid, while the sediment has simply moved from being suspended in the water to settling at the bottom. No new substances have been created in either change, so they are not chemical changes."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change because the oatmeal and milk retain their original properties, even though they combine to form a mixture. No new substance is formed in the process, which would be the case in a chemical change. Thus, this process is a physical change where you can separate the two substances again."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

['a 300-gram mug of cocoa at a temperature of 35Â°C', 'a 300-gram mug of cocoa at a temperature of 30Â°C']	1	The objects are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How is temperature related to thermal energy?	"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two mugs of cocoa have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 30Â°C mug of cocoa is colder than the 35Â°C mug of cocoa, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly proportional to the temperature of an object. This means that if two objects have the same mass and are made up of the same material, the one with a higher temperature will have more thermal energy. In this case, the 35Â°C mug of cocoa has a higher temperature than the 30Â°C one, hence, the 30Â°C mug of cocoa has less thermal energy."
	Select the one substance that is not a mineral.	['Fluorite is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.', 'Wool is not a pure substance. It is a solid.', 'Baryte is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Baryte is a mineral.
Wool is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, wool is not a mineral.
Fluorite is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The substance that is not a mineral is wool. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic, solid substances with a specific chemical composition and crystal structure, while wool is an organic material derived from animals. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria to be classified as a mineral. Moreover, the text also mentions that wool is not a pure substance, which is another characteristic of minerals."

A wombat is a mammal. It has fur and feeds its young milk.
Wombats have strong claws on their front feet. They use their claws to dig underground holes called burrows."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The giant moray is the correct answer as it is the only fish among the choices. Fish are generally known to live underwater and have fins, which is true for the giant moray. The other options, a wombat, cobra, and American toad, are identified as a mammal, reptile, and amphibian respectively."

['neither; the samples have the same temperature', 'sample A', 'sample B']	1	The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The kinetic energy of a particle is related to its mass and velocity. Despite both samples having particles with the same average speed, sample A's particles have more mass, leading to higher kinetic energy. The sample with higher kinetic energy has a higher temperature, so sample A is the warmer one."

Red, blue, and green go together. They are colors.
Mom, dad, grandma, and grandpa go together. They are people in a family."	Hen, chicken, and duck go together. They are birds. Girl is not a bird, so it is not like the other words.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The words duck, hen, and chicken all belong to the category of birds. They are all avian creatures. On the other hand, the word 'girl' does not fit into this category as it is a term used to describe a young human female. Therefore, 'girl' is the word that is not like the others."

['simple', 'compound-complex', 'compound', 'complex']	3		closed choice	grade7	language science	grammar	Phrases and clauses	Is the sentence simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex?	"A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

Sometimes a dependent clause in a complex or compound-complex sentence can interrupt an independent clause.
Orcas that are kept in captivity often have bent dorsal fins."	"The sentence is complex. It is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause begins with the subordinating conjunction as.
As Noah sat down on the rickety old chair, it abruptly collapsed beneath him."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The sentence is complex because it contains an independent clause ""it abruptly collapsed beneath him"" and a dependent clause ""As Noah sat down on the rickety old chair"". The dependent clause cannot stand alone as a complete sentence and is introduced with the subordinating conjunction ""as"". Hence, the sentence structure is complex, not simple, compound, or compound-complex."

SOLUTION: The phrase ""old news"" is an example of an oxymoron. An oxymoron is a figure of speech that combines two seemingly contradictory terms for effect, which is the case here. In the phrase ""old news"", ""old"" and ""news"" are contradictory because news is typically understood as new information, not old. Therefore, this text uses an oxymoron, not a chiasmus."
	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Natalie can play the banjo."	['inherited', 'acquired']	1	Hint: Playing an instrument well takes practice.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to play the banjo. Instead, some people learn how to play. So, playing the banjo is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The ability to play a banjo is an acquired trait. This is because it is a skill that is learned over time through practice and not a trait that is inherited or passed down from parents to offspring. A person does not inherit the knowledge or ability to play an instrument from their parents. Consequently, irrespective of one's genetic make-up, anyone can potentially learn to play the banjo."

I can't wait until tomorrow!"	The sentence asks something, and it ends with a question mark. It is an interrogative sentence.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Does Cora have any hobbies?"" is an interrogative sentence because it is asking a question. Interrogative sentences are typically characterized by their structure and by the fact that they end with a question mark. They are designed to elicit information, which is what this sentence does. It is not making a statement or expressing an emotion, so it is not a declarative or exclamatory sentence."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of basalt match the properties of a rock. So, basalt is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Basalt is a rock, not a mineral. This is because it is not a pure substance and does not have a fixed crystal structure, which are key characteristics of minerals. On the other hand, being solid, found in nature, not made by living things, and dark-colored are some of the properties it shares with many rocks.

	"What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
shaking up salad dressing"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	0		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The answer is 0, ""Both are only physical changes"", because both erosion caused by wind and shaking up salad dressing are physical changes.

In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cucumber plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with bumpy fruit or smooth fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for bumpy fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for smooth fruit.
Bumpy fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with bumpy fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
Smooth fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to offspring with smooth fruit is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with bumpy fruit. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with smooth fruit."	"ANSWER: 4
SOLUTION: The Punnett square shows that all the four boxes have the genotype 'ff', which corresponds to smooth fruit. Since the genotype for bumpy fruit (F dominant allele) is not represented in any of the four boxes, it implies that the cross will not produce any offspring with bumpy fruit. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to offspring with smooth fruit is 0:4, which corresponds to choice number 4."

There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The supply of men's shirts in Burlington likely went down. The reduction from seven to three men's clothing stores on Main Street suggests that the number of suppliers has decreased. With fewer stores to sell men's shirts, the overall supply in the market would likely have been affected and thus reduced."

['N2H3', 'NH3', 'N2H4', 'NH']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Identify chemical formulas for ball-and-stick models	"Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above."	N is the symbol for nitrogen. According to the legend, nitrogen atoms are shown in blue. H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. The chemical formula will contain the symbols N and H. There is one nitrogen atom, so N will not have a subscript. There are three hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 3. The correct formula is NH3. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The molecule in question consists of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. The chemical formula for this combination is NH3, which corresponds to choice 1.

A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype LL for the leaf texture gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is LL. The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for fuzzy leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is LL. This genotype includes two dominant alleles (L) which indicate fuzzy leaves. Since the plant has at least one dominant allele, it will exhibit the trait associated with that allele, which in this case is fuzzy leaves. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait is fuzzy leaves."
	Which object has less thermal energy?	['a pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 145Â°F', 'a pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 185Â°F']	0	The objects are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How is temperature related to thermal energy?	"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 145Â°F pot of spaghetti sauce is colder than the 185Â°F pot of spaghetti sauce, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object possesses. In this case, the pot of spaghetti sauce at a temperature of 145Â°F has less thermal energy compared to the pot at a temperature of 185Â°F. This is because the 145Â°F pot is cooler than the 185Â°F pot."
	Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the thorns trait?	['having thorns', 'not having thorns']	0	"In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
A certain rose plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the thorns gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the thorns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be having thorns."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The rose plant's genotype is heterozygous (Rr) which means it has one dominant allele (R) and one recessive allele (r). The dominant allele is for having thorns. Therefore, even though the plant has a recessive allele, the dominant trait will be expressed. Hence, the phenotype of the rose plant for the thorns trait is 'having thorns'."

"	The text argues that Professor Harrell's research is untrustworthy because someone else at her university was caught falsifying data. However, this isn't necessarily true. The practices of one researcher at a university do not necessarily reflect the practices of another researcher at the same university. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text suggests that Professor Harrell's research may be unreliable because of the misconduct of another researcher from the same institution. It is trying to discredit Professor Harrell based on the negative actions of her colleague. This is an example of the ""guilt by association"" fallacy, as it tries to tarnish Professor Harrell's credibility by associating her with undesired behavior without providing any direct evidence of her involvement in any malpractices."
	"What kind of sentence is this?
Madelyn felt intimidated by the steep cliff that she faced on her first rock-climbing adventure."	['interrogative', 'declarative', 'exclamatory']	1		closed choice	grade9	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement and always ends with a period.
The nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.
An imperative sentence makes a request or a demand and usually ends with a period. If a demand shows strong feeling, it can end with an exclamation point.
For this assignment, use references to support your claims.
Don't drive so quickly in the construction zone!
An interrogative sentence asks a question and always ends with a question mark.
Given the recent critiques of her new strategic plan, do you think the CEO will reconsider the company's direction?
An exclamatory sentence is a statement that shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamation always ends with an exclamation point.
I can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!"	The sentence is a statement and ends with a period. It is a declarative sentence.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence given is a declarative sentence as it makes a statement or expresses an opinion, which is an attribute of declarative sentences. It does not ask a question (interrogative sentence) nor does it express strong emotion (exclamatory sentence). Furthermore, it ends with a period, not a question mark or exclamation point which confirms it as a declarative sentence."

SOLUTION: The guide words on a dictionary page indicate the first and last word on that page. Any word that would appear on that page should alphabetically fall between these two guide words. In this case, the word 'stalk' does not fall between 'snap' and 'soar' alphabetically. Therefore, the answer is 'no' (1)."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	"[""Gary's brother Ryan wondered whether Gary ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon."", ""Gary's brother Ryan wondered whether he ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon.""]"	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun he could refer to Gary or Ryan.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. He has been replaced with Gary.
Gary's brother Ryan wondered whether Gary ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The vague pronoun reference can be found in the sentence ""Gary's brother Ryan wondered whether he ran fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon."" The pronoun 'he' is unclear because it could refer to either Gary or Ryan. This ambiguity makes it difficult to understand who the sentence is about. On the other hand, the first sentence is clear and specific, indicating that Gary is the one who may have run fast enough to qualify for the Boston Marathon."

A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells."	"Stretchy is a property. A stretchy material gets longer when you pull on it.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pulling on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the gum would stretch more. If you pull on soft chewing gum, it will get longer."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The gum would stretch more when pulled as compared to a metal hair clip. This is because gum is made of a stretchy material which tends to get longer when pulled. On the other hand, metal is a hard and rigid material which does not stretch easily. Therefore, in terms of stretchiness, gum has a higher capacity than a metal hair clip."

In a J. M. Barrie novel, the character Peter Pan retreats to Neverland and refuses to grow up.
The allusion Peter Pan means a person who won't take on adult responsibilities."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The term ""Peter Pan"" is derived from a character in J.M. Barrie's novel called ""Peter Pan"". Peter Pan is a boy who never grows up and lives in a fictional place called Neverland. When Sophia referred to Aaron as a ""Peter Pan type"", she means to say that Aaron is someone who refuses to take up adult responsibilities, just like Peter Pan. Therefore, the source of the allusion is literature."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task requires us to determine which sample has a higher temperature based on the given information. It is stated that each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A, therefore, the average kinetic energy in sample B is higher. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles, sample B would have a higher temperature."

Making lemonade is a ()."	['physical change', 'chemical change']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Making lemonade is a physical change. The sugar, water, and lemon juice are mixed together. But they do not change into different types of matter.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Making lemonade is a physical change because the ingredients (lemon, sugar, and water) maintain their original properties. They mix together but do not form a new substance with different properties. A physical change involves changes in the form of a substance, but not in its molecular composition. So, no new substance is formed, hence it is a physical change."

The allele B is for a brown body, and the allele b is for a white body.
A certain Channel catfish from this group has a white body. This catfish has two alleles for a white body."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The Channel catfish has two alleles for a white body (b). So, the catfish's genotype for the body color gene is bb.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The genotype of an organism refers to the combination of alleles it possesses for a specific gene. In this case, the Channel catfish has a white body, which is represented by the allele 'b'. The problem states the catfish has two alleles for a white body, hence its genotype would be 'bb'. That's why the correct answer is 1."

a copper statue turning green
boiling sugar to make caramel"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both copper turning green and sugar turning into caramel are examples of chemical changes. This is because in both cases, the original substance is changing into a new substance with different properties. The green color on the copper statue is caused by a reaction with oxygen, creating copper oxide. Meanwhile, the heating process changes the sugar into a sticky, brown caramel. Therefore, the commonality between these two processes is that they are both chemical changes."
	Which tennis ball has more thermal energy?	['the colder tennis ball', 'the hotter tennis ball']	1	Two tennis balls are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two tennis balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter tennis ball has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is related to the temperature of an object, with higher temperature objects having more thermal energy. This is because thermal energy is the total energy of all the particles in an object, which includes kinetic energy (movement) and potential energy (stored energy). When an object is heated, its particles move faster and thus possess more kinetic energy, contributing to a higher total thermal energy. Therefore, the hotter tennis ball has more thermal energy."

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The first text uses can in its traditional sense: to have the ability to.
As they observed the animals on the open grassland, the wildlife photographer said to Nicholas, ""Did you know that cheetahs can run as fast as seventy-five miles per hour?""
The second text uses can in its nontraditional sense: to have permission to.
As they observed the cheetahs on the open grassland, the wildlife photographer said to Nicholas, ""You can borrow my camera if you want.""
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word can because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first text uses the word 'can' in its traditional sense which is to indicate the ability or capacity to do something. In the sentence, ""Did you know that cheetahs can run as fast as seventy-five miles per hour?"" the word 'can' is used to denote the physical ability of cheetahs to run at a certain speed. On the other hand, the second text uses 'can' to imply permission, which is not the traditional usage of the word."

	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Manuel is good at cooking."	['acquired', 'inherited']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to cook. Instead, many people learn how to cook. So, cooking is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Cooking is a skill that is learned and developed over time, rather than being genetically inherited. One usually learns to cook from family members, cooking classes, or self-teaching. It involves learning techniques, experimenting with ingredients, and understanding flavors which are all acquired traits. Therefore, Manuel being good at cooking is an acquired trait."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two blocks of iron have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 190Â°C block is hotter than the 180Â°C block, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly proportional to the temperature of an object. Therefore, the higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object possesses. In this case, both blocks have the identical mass, but their temperatures differ. Thus, the block of iron at 190Â°C has more thermal energy than the one at 180Â°C."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
a copper statue turning green
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The copper statue turning green is due to a reaction with the oxygen in the air, resulting in a chemical change to copper oxide. The tarnish removal from the silver spoon using polish is also a chemical change, as the polish transforms the tarnish into a different kind of substance that can be easily wiped off. Therefore, both changes are chemical, not physical, and are not caused by heating or cooling. Hence, the answer is 1 - Both are chemical changes."

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because Nembrotha megalocera is an animal and all animals have cells with a nucleus. This is a basic characteristic of eukaryotic cells, which include all animal and plant cells. The presence of a nucleus differentiates eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus. Therefore, Nembrotha megalocera, being an animal, has cells with a nucleus."
	Which watermelon has a higher temperature?	['the watermelon with less thermal energy', 'the watermelon with more thermal energy']	1	Two watermelons are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two watermelons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the watermelon with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy refers to the internal energy present in a system due to its temperature level. It is the total of all the kinetic and potential energy of all the particles in a system. If two watermelons are identical in all aspects except for their thermal energy, the one with more thermal energy will inherently have a higher temperature. Therefore, the watermelon with more thermal energy has a higher temperature."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the basic principles of magnetism, which states that similar poles of magnets repel each other and opposite poles attract each other. The hint provided indicates that the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other, which are like poles. Therefore, based on the principle of magnetism, these magnets will repel each other. Thus, the answer is '0', which corresponds to 'repel'."
	Compare the motion of three ducks. Which duck was moving at the highest speed?	['a duck that moved 565kilometers west in 10hours', 'a duck that moved 975kilometers south in 10hours', 'a duck that moved 860kilometers east in 10hours']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each duck moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each duck moved for 10 hours. The duck that moved 975 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance it has traveled by the time it took to travel that distance. In this case, all three ducks traveled for the same amount of time - 10 hours. Therefore, the duck that traveled the farthest distance in those 10 hours would have the highest speed. The duck that moved 975 kilometers in 10 hours traveled the farthest distance, so it was moving at the highest speed."

Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The crocodile egg fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the crocodile egg fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the concept of stratigraphy, which is the study of rock layers.

This is a simple sentence. There is one subject, Farmer Ben, and one predicate, wears his heavy coat in the winter."	"The first sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two simple sentences joined by a comma and the conjunction but.
The pirates buried the treasure chest, but some sailors soon found it."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first sentence is a compound sentence as it contains two independent clauses that are connected by a coordinating conjunction 'but'. The two independent clauses are 'The pirates buried the treasure chest' and 'some sailors soon found it'. On the other hand, the second sentence is a simple sentence with one independent clause. Hence, option 0 is the correct answer."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
an old sandwich rotting in a trashcan
using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	0		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (0)
SOLUTION: Both the rotting of a sandwich and the use of polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon are chemical changes. This is because in both cases, the original substance is transformed into a new one. Neither of these changes is caused by heating or cooling, and they are not physical changes as the original structure of the substances is altered. Thus, the answer is (0) Both are chemical changes."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the relation between kinetic energy, mass and temperature in gas particles. Though both samples have the same average speed, sample B particles have more mass, hence higher kinetic energy. In gases, temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy. Therefore, if sample B has higher kinetic energy, it means it has a higher temperature. So, the answer is 0, which corresponds to sample B."

Silver bromide is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	1	Silver bromide is used on the film that some photographers use in their cameras. The chemical formula for silver bromide is AgBr.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms."	"You can tell whether silver bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silver bromide, AgBr, contains two atomic symbols: Ag for silver and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that silver bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since silver bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silver bromide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Silver bromide is a compound. This is evident from the chemical formula AgBr, which indicates that it is composed of two elements, silver (Ag) and bromine (Br). Elementary substances consist of only one type of atom, while compounds are composed of two or more different elements bonded together. Hence, silver bromide falls under the category of compounds."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion draconian is Greek history.
Draco, a government official in seventh-century Athens, Greece, wrote a code of laws that called for severe punishments for even minor offenses.
The allusion draconian means harsh."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The allusion ""draconian"" originates from Greek history. This term is derived from Draco, a 7th-century Athenian legislator known for his harsh legal code. Thus, in the context of the sentence, Darnel is implying that the new recycling regulations are excessively severe or harsh, similar to Draco's laws. Thus, the correct choice is Greek history (1)."

Zirconium is ()."	['a compound', 'an elementary substance']	1	Most of the zirconium produced every year is used in certain types of power plants to keep dangerous fuel from leaking. The chemical formula for zirconium is Zr.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether zirconium is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for zirconium is Zr. This formula contains one symbol: Zr. So, the formula tells you that zirconium is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zirconium is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The chemical formula for zirconium is Zr, which indicates that it is made up of only one chemical element. Substances that are made up of only one chemical element are known as elementary substances. Therefore, zirconium is an elementary substance, not a compound, which is made up of two or more elements."

The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cats."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight fur or curly fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for curly fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for straight fur.
Straight fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the dominant version of the fur type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur type gene. So, offspring with straight fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Curly fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the recessive version of the fur type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur type gene. So, offspring with curly fur must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with straight fur to offspring with curly fur is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with straight fur. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with curly fur."	"ANSWER: 4
SOLUTION: Based on the Punnett square, all 4 boxes have the genotype FF or Ff, which means the offspring will have straight fur. Since the recessive gene for curly fur (ff) doesn't appear in any of the boxes, there will be no offspring with curly fur. Thus, the expected ratio of offspring with straight fur to offspring with curly fur is 4:0, which corresponds to choice number 4."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The magnets in Pair 2 are closer to each other than those in Pair 1. The distance between magnets directly affects the magnitude of the magnetic force, with a smaller distance resulting in a greater force. Despite the fact that the magnets in Pair 1 repel and those in Pair 2 attract, this only affects the direction of the force, not its magnitude.

['the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy', 'the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy']	1	Two bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two bowls of oatmeal are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The temperature of a substance is directly related to its thermal energy. Thermal energy refers to the total energy of all the particles in an object, while temperature refers to the average energy of those particles. Therefore, if two bowls of oatmeal are identical in every other aspect, the bowl with more thermal energy would have a higher temperature. Hence, the answer is 1."

Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A bald eagle's scientific name is Haliaeetus leucocephalus.
Pelecanus occidentalis does not have the same scientific name as a bald eagle. So, Haliaeetus leucocephalus and Pelecanus occidentalis are not in the same species.
Haliaeetus leucocephalus has the same scientific name as a bald eagle. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Bubo scandiacus does not have the same scientific name as a bald eagle. So, Haliaeetus leucocephalus and Bubo scandiacus are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The scientific name for the bald eagle is Haliaeetus leucocephalus. The organism with the same scientific name would be in the same species. Among the choices, only choice 2 Haliaeetus leucocephalus matches the scientific name of the bald eagle. Hence, the organisms in choice 2 would be in the same species as the bald eagle."
	Which statement describes the runner's motion?	['The runner is accelerating.', 'The runner has a constant velocity.']	0	A runner is increasing her speed on the final stretch of a race.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Identify whether objects are accelerating	"An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.
An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:
speeding up,
slowing down, or
changing direction."	The runner is speeding up. So, the runner is accelerating.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The hint provided states that the runner is increasing her speed during the final stretch of the race. This indicates a change in her velocity over time, which is the definition of acceleration. Therefore, the statement that describes the runner's motion is ""The runner is accelerating."" This makes option 0 the correct choice."

Silver bromide is ()."	['a compound', 'an elementary substance']	0	The model below represents silver bromide. Silver bromide is used on the film that some photographers use in their cameras.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the compound potassium chloride.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element.

Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that silver bromide is composed of bromine atoms and silver atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that silver bromide is composed of two chemical elements: bromine and silver. Since silver bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silver bromide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Silver bromide is a compound because it is composed of two different elements, silver and bromine, that are chemically bonded together. An elementary substance, on the other hand, is a pure substance that consists of only one type of atom. Therefore, since silver bromide includes more than one type of atom, the correct answer is that it is a compound."

Ice melting in a cup is a ()."	['physical change', 'chemical change']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	"Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.
The links between atoms in the water molecules do not change. So, a different type of matter is not formed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because ice melting is considered a physical change. This is because the process involves a change in state from solid to liquid, but the substance itself (water) doesn't change. No new substances are formed during this process which indicates that it is not a chemical change."

Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.

There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of a garden snail is 2 inches.
2 yards is too long."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A garden snail typically measures around 1 to 2 inches in length, making it much smaller than 2 yards. Yards are generally used to measure larger distances or lengths, such as the length of a room or a field. Thus, 2 inches is the more accurate estimate for the length of a garden snail. 2 yards would be excessively large for a snail."

One bat moved 35 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other bat moved 45 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each bat spent the same amount of time moving. The bat that moved 35 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bat must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The bat that moved 35 kilometers in 5 hours was moving at a lower speed. This is determined by calculating the speed (distance/time) for each bat. The bat that moved 35 kilometers in 5 hours had a speed of 7 kilometers per hour, while the bat that moved 45 kilometers in 5 hours had a speed of 9 kilometers per hour.

The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The solution is 1 because the size of the magnets directly affects the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. In the given pairs, Magnet A is the same size in both but Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. Therefore, as per the hint given, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. Hence, the statement ""The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1"" is true."

['a spotted tail', 'II']	0	"In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele I is for a spotted tail, and the allele i is for an unspotted tail.
Undyne, a guppy from this group, has a spotted tail. Undyne has two alleles for a spotted tail."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Undyne's observable version of the tail spots trait is a spotted tail. So, Undyne's phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Based on the information provided, Undyne's phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail. The phenotype of an organism is the observable characteristic or trait, and in the case of Undyne, the observable trait is a spotted tail. This matches with choice 0, which states ""a spotted tail"". Therefore, the correct answer is 0."

His hand applies a force to the door, and the door opens.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Identify pushes and pulls	"A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The baby's hand applies a force to the cabinet door. This force causes the door to open. The direction of this force is toward the baby's hand. This force is a pull.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The correct answer is pull. The hint implies that the baby applies a force towards himself to open the cabinet door. The direction of the force is towards the baby, which makes it a pulling action. When we pull something, we apply force in a direction towards ourselves, hence pull is the correct answer."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.

3 pounds and 3 tons are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The mass of a dinner fork is generally light, making 3 ounces a reasonable estimate. In comparison, 3 pounds and 3 tons are far too heavy for such a small object. Consequently, the best estimate for the mass of a dinner fork is 3 ounces. These comparisons make it clear that the other options are not plausible, thus the correct choice is 2."

SOLUTION: The task is to determine which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles. The hint suggests looking at the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container. The solution then notes that Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter, thus concluding that Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles.

Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The first text uses random in its traditional sense: made or occurring without a definite pattern.
Camels in the wild tend to eat an apparently random assortment of leaves, grasses, shrubs, and other plant matter. As an adaptation to their native desert environment, they are able to eat even thorny and salt-heavy plants that most animals will reject.
The second text uses random in its nontraditional sense: odd or out of place.
During the nineteenth century, the U.S. Army used camels as pack animals in the Southwest. Though the program was discontinued after the outbreak of the Civil War, reported sightings of random camels throughout the Southwest continued through at least the 1940 s.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word random because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The first text uses 'random' to mean 'odd' or 'unexpected', in relation to the sightings of camels in the Southwest. However, the second text uses 'random' in its traditional sense, to describe the unpredictable, non-systematic assortment of plants that camels eat. This corresponds to the dictionary definition of 'random' as 'made, done, or happening without method or conscious decision.' Therefore, text 1 uses the word 'random' in its traditional sense."
	Select the living thing.	['cherry tree', 'stop sign']	0		closed choice	grade2	natural science	biology	Classification	Identify living and nonliving things	"All living things need food and water. Water helps living things stay healthy. Food gives living things energy. They can use this energy to grow and change. All living things grow and change during their lives.

For example, an oak tree is a living thing. It begins life as a seed. It takes in water from the soil. It makes food using energy from the sun. The oak tree gets taller and grows leaves and branches during its life."	"A stop sign is not a living thing.
Stop signs do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow. They do not need food or water.
A cherry tree is a living thing.
Cherry trees grow and change. They need food and water.
Cherry trees are plants. They make their own food using water, air, and energy from sunlight."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The cherry tree is the correct answer because it is a living thing. Living things are characterized by their ability to grow, reproduce, respond to their environment, and adapt. Cherry trees, like all plants, possess these traits as they grow and change, need water and nutrients, and produce offspring through seeds. On the other hand, a stop sign is an inanimate object, not a living organism."

A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.

The words legs and sunflower stalks are compared without the word like or as."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mr. Dodson's legs were as long as sunflower stalks"" is the correct answer because it uses a simile. Similes compare two different things using the words 'like' or 'as', in this case 'as' is used to compare Mr. Dodson's legs to sunflower stalks. On the other hand, the sentence ""Mr. Dodson's long legs were sunflower stalks"" is a metaphor, which is a direct comparison without using 'like' or 'as'."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
silver jewelry tarnishing
boiling sugar to make caramel"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But silver tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: Both the examples provided, silver jewelry tarnishing and boiling sugar to make caramel, are chemical changes. In both cases, the original substance is changed into a different substance with different properties. Tarnishing is a reaction between silver and sulfur in the air, resulting in a black tarnish, while boiling sugar changes it into a brown, sticky substance called caramel. Therefore, the correct answer is ""Both are chemical changes."""

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets. The closer the magnets are, the stronger the force.

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task requires understanding the relationship between temperature and the average kinetic energy of gas particles. From the given solution, we know that the particles in sample A have a higher average speed, and thus a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B. Therefore, according to the kinetic theory of gases, sample A has a higher temperature as the average kinetic energy of particles directly correlates with the temperature of the gas."

"	The text argues that free gym memberships will result in lower productivity. However, offering free gym memberships doesn't necessarily suggest that employees will spend all their time at the gym rather than at work. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text is a clear example of a straw man fallacy. The human resource department's position is misrepresented, suggesting that they want employees to spend all their time at the gym and not work. In reality, the department is simply advocating for free gym memberships, not implying that work should be neglected.

Wesley has naturally curly hair."	['acquired', 'inherited']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	"Some humans are born with naturally curly hair. Others are born with naturally straight hair. Curly and straight are examples of hair texture.
Some people decide to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally curly hair is an inherited trait."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The trait of naturally curly hair is inherited. This is because hair texture, whether curly or straight, is determined by genetics. It is something a person is born with and cannot be acquired or changed without artificial means. Therefore, curly hair is an inherited trait, not an acquired one."

	Which cherry pie has a higher temperature?	['the cherry pie with more thermal energy', 'the cherry pie with less thermal energy']	0	Two cherry pies are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two cherry pies are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cherry pie with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The cherry pie with more thermal energy has a higher temperature. This is because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the molecules in a substance, which is essentially thermal energy. Therefore, if a cherry pie has more thermal energy, it means its molecules are moving faster on average, which translates to a higher temperature."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Peeling a banana is a physical change. The peel is not covering the rest of the fruit anymore. But both the peel and the banana are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But peeling a banana is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Both butter melting on a hot day and peeling a banana are physical changes, not chemical ones. In both cases, the structure of the substance changes, but its molecular composition remains the same. Therefore, the answer choice ""Both are only physical changes"" is the correct one. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the commonality between the two changes."

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: (2)
SOLUTION: The solution is based on the fact that the size of the magnets affects the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. In both pairs, Magnet A is the same size but the size of Magnet B differs. Since Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.
Apollo, a leopard from this group, has a spotted coat. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat and one allele for a black coat."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one allele for a black coat (a). So, Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The question asks for Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene. The information provided states that Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one allele for a black coat (a). Therefore, Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa, which corresponds to choice 1. The genotype is not the visible trait itself (in this case, a spotted coat), but the genetic information that leads to the trait."

Complete the sentence with the word awoke. It describes the smoke detector as if it were a person who is waking up.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The answer is ""awoke"" as it is a term commonly used to describe a person waking up, therefore, personifying the smoke detector. The term ""went off"" wouldn't be accurate in this context as it does not provide the smoke detector with human characteristics, which is the requirement of the question. Thus, using ""awoke"" adds a human-like attribute to the smoke detector, making it an example of personification."

The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A simple sentence is a sentence that consists of just one independent clause. An independent clause is a group of words that has a subject and a verb, and expresses a complete thought. Sentence 0, ""The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch."" is a simple sentence because it only has one subject and one verb and expresses a complete thought.

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.

SOLUTION: The mass of a goat is more likely to be 33 kilograms rather than 33 grams. Goats are relatively large mammals, and their weight can vary widely based on breed, age, and sex, but they are definitely heavier than 33 grams. 33 grams is the weight of a very small animal or object. Thus, the better estimate for the mass of a goat is 33 kilograms."

Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Baking an apple pie and cooking an egg both involve the application of heat, which causes the ingredients to undergo a chemical change. This means that the matter within the ingredients changes, making this a chemical, not merely a physical, transformation. Therefore, answer 1, ""Both are caused by heating,"" is the correct choice. Cooling does not cause these changes, and the changes are not just physical, ruling out the other options."

Genuine imitation leather is a contradiction, because genuine means real, and imitation means fake or synthetic."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text uses the phrase ""genuine imitation leather"", which is an oxymoron. This is because the two terms in the phrase contradict each other: ""genuine"" means authentic or real, while ""imitation"" means a copy or fake. The use of such a contradictory phrase fits the definition of an oxymoron, which is why 1 is the correct answer."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force is determined by the distance between magnets - the closer the magnets, the stronger the force.

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 80Â°F bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 70Â°F bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to an object's temperature and mass. In this case, the mass of the oatmeal in both bowls is assumed to be the same, but the temperatures are different. Since the bowl of oatmeal at 80Â°F is at a higher temperature than the one at 70Â°F, it contains more thermal energy. Thus, the correct answer is 1."

In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two budgerigar parakeets."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with blue body feathers or green body feathers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for green body feathers, is dominant over the b allele, which is for blue body feathers.
Blue body feathers is the recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the recessive version of the body feather color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with blue body feathers must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
Green body feathers is the dominant allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the dominant version of the body feather color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with green body feathers must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with blue body feathers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green body feathers."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The Punnett square showed that all 4 boxes had the genotype of BB or Bb, which corresponds to green body feathers. Since the green body feather allele is dominant, there are no possibilities for offspring to have blue body feathers. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers is 0:4, corresponding to choice 1."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0Â° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180Â°E and 180Â°W.

The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	"Mixing copper and tin to make bronze is a physical change. To make bronze, a furnace melts the copper and tin so that they can be mixed easily.
Solid bronze forms when the mixture cools. The copper and tin are now combined as bronze. But they are still made of the same types of matter as before."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Mixing copper and tin to make bronze is a physical change because the individual properties of copper and tin are preserved, even though they are combined to form bronze. The process does not produce a new substance with properties different from the two metals. Rather, it's the form and state of the metals that change, which are characteristics of a physical change, not a chemical one."

Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Cassie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Cassie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Cassie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The forces acting on Cassie are not equal and opposite and hence they are unbalanced. The force of gravity pulling her down is 600N, while the force from the seat pushing her up is 1200N. Since these forces are not equal, they do not cancel out. Therefore, there is a net force acting on Cassie, indicating that the forces are unbalanced."

"[""It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age."", 'It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles.', ""It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure."", 'It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.']"	3	"Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive."	closed choice	grade5	language science	reading-comprehension	Informational texts: level 1	Read passages about animals	Informational texts include many facts, examples, and details. Authors don't always directly state how these things connect to each other. So, you may need to make guesses, or inferences, to understand how the ideas from the text fit together. Inferences can help you understand the whole text and draw conclusions about the information. Be sure to base your inferences on details found in the text as well as things you already know.	"Think about these details from the text:
Fossils can show how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Fossil evidence shows that beetles die out less often than any other animal.
Beetles' low extinction rate helps explain the large number of beetle species.
In order to show that beetles die out less often than other animals, scientists must have compared different animals' extinction rates. To do this, they would need to figure out how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Based on these clues, you can guess that fossil evidence let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct animals. This helped them figure out that beetles die out less often than other animals, which explains the huge number of beetle species."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The text provides several insights into how fossils have helped scientists understand why there are so many species of beetles. It specifically mentions that fossils have shown that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal, suggesting that they don't die out as often as other species. This means that scientists have used fossils to compare the number of extinct beetles with the number of other extinct animals, thus understanding the large number of beetle species. Therefore, option 3 is the correct choice based on the information provided in the text."

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the blue particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of blue particles, look at both the number of blue particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of blue particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of blue particles."	"ANSWER: (1) Solution B
SOLUTION: The task provided does not present an actual diagram or numerical data to directly compare the concentration in Solutions A and B. However, the solution given implies that Solution B has more blue particles per milliliter. Hence, the concentration of blue particles is higher in Solution B. The high concentration implies that there are more solute particles in a given quantity of solvent."

['attract', 'repel']	0	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task is to predict the interaction between two magnets based on their positioning. The hint indicates that the south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other. In the world of magnetism, opposite poles (north and south) attract each other. Therefore, these two magnets will attract each other, which corresponds to choice 0."

The snowy owl has white feathers covering its body. It is not adapted to be camouflaged among dead leaves."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The plated leaf chameleon is the correct answer because it has reddish-brown scales that enable it to blend in with dead leaves, providing an effective camouflage. This is similar to the leaf-mimic grasshopper's adaptation. The snowy owl, on the other hand, has white feathers and is not adapted to camouflage among dead leaves. Therefore, it would not blend in with the environment as well as the plated leaf chameleon."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75Â°F bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 70Â°F bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is related to the temperature of an object, which is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in the object. The higher the temperature, the more the particles are moving and the more thermal energy they have. Therefore, a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 75Â°F would have more thermal energy than a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 70Â°F."

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal."	"Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 8 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 3 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left."	"ANSWER: (1) to the right than to the left
SOLUTION: The diagram indicates that the solution started off with more solute particles on the left side. Over time, during the process of diffusion, the solute particles moved across the membrane to balance out the concentration.

The musk ox has skin with thick fur on top and a thick layer of fat underneath it. Its skin is adapted for survival in cold places.
The armadillo lizard has scales covering much of its skin. Its skin is not adapted for survival in cold places."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The Musk Ox, similar to the Arctic wolf, has skin adapted for survival in cold places. It has layers of thick fur and fat underneath its skin which helps it to keep warm in harsh cold weather. On the contrary, the Armadillo Lizard does not have any such adaptations for cold climates as its skin is covered with scales. Hence, it is the Musk Ox which has skin adapted for cold climates."
	"What is the source of the allusion in the sentence below?
When I learned the details of Ariel's Faustian bargain, I was in disbelief."	['literature', 'history']	0		closed choice	grade10	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Faustian bargain is literature.
In a play by Christopher Marlowe based on the legend of Faust, a man strikes a deal with the devil. Disregarding the long-term consequences of his actions, he sells his soul in exchange for power.
The allusion Faustian bargain means a compromise of one's values for personal gain."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The term 'Faustian bargain' originates from the narrative of a character named Faust in German literature. He makes a pact with the devil, trading his soul for knowledge and power. This is a classic example of a literary allusion, where a phrase references a well-known story or character from literature. Therefore, the source of the allusion in the sentence is literature, not history."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
milk going sour
deep-frying chicken"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: (3)
SOLUTION: Both milk going sour and deep-frying chicken represent chemical changes. In the case of milk going sour, a chemical change occurs as bacteria in the milk convert lactose into lactic acid. With deep-frying chicken, the heat causes a chemical reaction that changes the composition of the chicken. Therefore, the commonality between these two changes is that they are both chemical changes, not physical changes, and they are not solely caused by heating or cooling."
	Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Lakeside. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Lakeside?	['The supply probably went up.', 'The supply probably went down.']	1		closed choice	grade8	social science	economics	Supply and demand	Understand overall supply and demand	"Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The number of men's clothing stores in Lakeside reduced from seven to three, which indicates that there are fewer suppliers of men's shirts now. This means the overall supply of men's shirts in the area likely decreased. Thus, it is most probable that the supply of men's shirts in Lakeside went down."
	Which is more flexible?	['ice rink', 'wool hat']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Materials	Compare properties of materials	"Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it."	"Flexible is a property. A flexible material can be bent without breaking easily.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine bending the material shown in each picture."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A wool hat is more flexible than an ice rink. Flexibility refers to the ability of a material to bend without breaking. A wool hat, being made of a soft and pliable material, can easily be bent, folded, and manipulated without damage. On the other hand, an ice rink is rigid and would break or crack if one tried to bend it."

Contractions are not as informal as the other types, but they should be used sparingly in formal writing.
Compare the following sentences. The first is informal. The second is formal.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
"	"The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses slang (flipped out).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the slang, so it is more formal overall."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The first sentence uses the slang phrase ""flipped out"" to describe the mayor's reaction, which is less formal in nature. The second sentence, on the other hand, uses the more formal term ""furious"" to illustrate the same sentiment. Thus, the second sentence is more formal, as it avoids using slang and employs a more sophisticated vocabulary."

	Based on this information, what is Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?	['solid coloring', 'white spots']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Winnee is a cow from this group. Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Winnee's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Winnee's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for white spots. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.
To check this answer, consider whether Winnee's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Winnee's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Winnee's genotype for the coat pattern gene is homozygous recessive (aa), which means she carries two copies of the recessive allele. In this case, the recessive allele is responsible for the phenotype of white spots. Since both of Winnee's alleles are recessive (a), her phenotype will reflect the trait associated with the recessive allele, which is white spots. Therefore, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is white spots."

Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces. But each piece is still made of paper.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Both the changes mentioned are physical changes. Mixing sand and gravel doesn't form a new substance, it just creates a mixture. Similarly, tearing a piece of paper doesn't create a new substance, it just changes the form of the existing paper. Hence, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes. Neither heating nor cooling is involved in these changes."

fixed crystal structure
solid
found in nature
not made by living things
pure substance"	yes or no	grade6	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Potassium feldspar has all the properties of a mineral. So, potassium feldspar is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because potassium feldspar meets all the requirements to be classified as a mineral. It has a fixed crystal structure, it is solid, it is found in nature, it is not made by living things, and it is a pure substance. Hence, according to these characteristics, potassium feldspar is indeed a mineral."
	"Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
Ronald, you drive a beat-up car from the 1980s. For this reason, we can never allow you to be a lifeguard at the community pool."	"['false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist', ""ad hominem: a personal attack against one's opponent""]"	1		closed choice	grade7	language science	writing-strategies	Developing and supporting arguments	Classify logical fallacies	"A strong argument uses valid reasoning and logic in support of a claim. When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim
A logical fallacy may misrepresent the issues at hand:
Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
"	The text argues that people who drive old cars are likely to be poor lifeguards. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to someone's qualifications to be a lifeguard. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text implies that Ronald's ability to perform the duties of a lifeguard is directly related to the condition and age of his car, which is a personal and irrelevant aspect. This is a classic example of an ad hominem fallacy, where an argument is directed against a person rather than the position they are maintaining. Therefore, the logical fallacy used in the text is ad hominem."

Diamond is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	0	Diamond is commonly used to make jewelry but is also used in tools that can cut or polish any material. The chemical formula for diamond is C.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether diamond is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for diamond is C. This formula contains one symbol: C for carbon. So, the formula tells you that diamond is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, diamond is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The chemical formula of diamond is C, which stands for Carbon. This suggests that diamond is made of only one type of atom, which is carbon. Substances made of only one type of atom are referred to as elementary substances. Therefore, diamond is an elementary substance and not a compound."

Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task requires understanding of how magnetic force works. The hint and solution state that the size and distance between magnets affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Given that the magnets in both pairs are of the same size and at the same distance, the magnitude of the magnetic force will be the same in both pairs. The direction of the force (attracting or repelling) does not affect the magnitude, which leads to the conclusion that the answer is choice 1."
	Which brownie has more thermal energy?	['the colder brownie', 'the hotter brownie']	1	Two brownies are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two brownies are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter brownie has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is the total energy of all the particles in a sample of matter. It is related to the temperature of the matter, with hotter substances having more thermal energy due to their particles moving more quickly and having more kinetic energy. Since both brownies are identical in terms of mass and material, the hotter brownie contains more thermal energy because its particles are moving at a faster rate than those in the colder brownie."

The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The act of polishing tarnished silver involves a reaction between the polish and the tarnish (usually silver sulfide) on the silver spoon. This reaction results in the tarnish being converted into different substances which can be easily wiped away. Since this process involves a change in the chemical composition of the tarnish, it is classified as a chemical change."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each humpback whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One humpback whale moved 30 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other humpback whale moved 20 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each humpback whale spent the same amount of time moving. The humpback whale that moved 30 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that humpback whale must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. In this case, both humpback whales moved for the same time period of 10 hours. However, the second humpback whale covered a greater distance of 30 kilometers compared to the first whale that covered 20 kilometers. Therefore, the second humpback whale was moving at a higher speed."

['Greek history', 'ancient legend']	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Scheherazade is ancient legend.
The Arabian Nights presents the ancient legend of how Scheherazade successfully postpones her imminent death by mesmerizing her captor with a thousand and one fascinating tales.
The allusion Scheherazade means a person who uses his or her arts to distract someone and avoid consequences."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The allusion to Scheherazade is derived from an ancient legend, not from Greek history. Scheherazade is a character from the Middle Eastern collection of tales known as ""One Thousand and One Nights"" or ""Arabian Nights"". In the story, Scheherazade tells captivating stories to postpone her execution by her husband, the king. Hence, the reference to Scheherazade in this context implies someone who successfully avoids trouble or consequences through their storytelling or persuasive skills."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. This is because the force between two magnets depends on the distance between them. In Pair 1, the magnets are closer together than in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1, regardless of whether the magnets are attracting or repelling each other."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram."	"The better estimate for the mass of a small candy bar is 40 grams.
40 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A small candy bar is unlikely to weigh 40 kilograms as that is a significant amount of weight, more than many human beings weigh. This weight is comparable to that of a large dog or a small person. Therefore, it is much more reasonable to estimate that a small candy bar weighs 40 grams. This weight aligns more with the size and substance of a candy bar."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One sailboat moved 30 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other sailboat moved 80 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each sailboat spent the same amount of time moving. The sailboat that moved 30 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is calculated by dividing the distance it covers by the time it takes. In this case, both sailboats spent the same amount of time moving, but the sailboat that moved 30 kilometers covered a shorter distance in that time. Therefore, the sailboat that moved 30 kilometers had a lower speed."

As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Hancock's snoring."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text uses the phrase ""as quiet as a jackhammer"" to describe Mr. Hancock's snoring. This is an example of verbal irony because a jackhammer is known for being extremely loud, not quiet. Therefore, despite the literal words suggesting that the snoring is quiet, the intended meaning is that it is actually very loud. This is why the correct choice is ""The snoring is loud."""

Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant."	"Conifers use their cones to make seeds. Seeds grow inside the female cones.
Many conifers have thin pointed leaves called needles. The needles make most of the conifer's food. Needles do not make seeds.
Roots take in water and nutrients from the soil. They do not make seeds."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Conifers are types of trees and shrubs that produce cones, which are structures that contain their seeds. The cones are the reproductive parts of these plants, where seeds are formed and developed. Needles, on the other hand, are the leaves of the conifers and are primarily responsible for photosynthesis, not seed production. Roots are responsible for absorbing water and nutrients from the soil, not for seed production. Therefore, the correct answer is cones (2)."

A metaphor, on the other hand, would imply this comparison without using 'like' or 'as'. Therefore, the sentence uses a simile, not a metaphor."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
bending a paper clip
breaking a rock in half"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	0		closed choice	grade3	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Bending a paper clip is a physical change. After you bend it, the paper clip has a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Breaking a rock in half is a physical change. The rock gets broken into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the original rock.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Both bending a paper clip and breaking a rock in half are considered physical changes. In both cases, the structure of the objects is altered, but their molecular composition remains the same. It means that no new substances are formed during these changes. Thus, they are not chemical changes, nor are they caused by heating or cooling. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes."
	What is the volume of a bathtub?

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a bathtub is 65 gallons.
65 fluid ounces and 65 cups are both too little."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the volume of a bathtub is 65 gallons. This is because a standard bathtub can hold around 42-80 gallons of water. Comparing this to the other options, 65 cups and 65 fluid ounces are both significantly less than the capacity of a typical bathtub. Therefore, 65 gallons is the most reasonable estimate."

['the Bible', 'British history']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Luddite is British history.
In the early nineteenth century, factories were replacing the jobs of craftsmen. Some of these craftsmen banded together to destroy the new machinery; those who did so were called Luddites.
The allusion Luddite means a person opposed to new technology."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The term 'Luddite' originates from British history and not the Bible. During the early 19th century, a group of craftsmen, known as Luddites, protested against the rise of machinery that threatened their jobs. They were known for destroying these machines. In modern usage, a Luddite is someone who is resistant to new technology or innovations, which fits the context of Mr. Cline not owning a cell phone."

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. It has been replaced with the blouse.
If Emily's skirt doesn't match the blouse, she will have to exchange the blouse for another item."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct option is 1 because the pronoun ""it"" in the sentence ""If Emily's skirt doesn't match the blouse, she will have to exchange it for another item"" is vague. It is not clear if ""it"" refers to the skirt or the blouse. Therefore, this sentence contains a vague pronoun reference which can cause confusion for the reader. The first option is clear and direct, making it the incorrect choice for this task."
	Which object has more thermal energy?

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 40Â°C bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 25Â°C bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy refers to the internal energy present in a system due to its temperature. It is the total internal kinetic energy of an object due to the random motion of its atoms and molecules. Therefore, higher the temperature, higher will be the thermal energy. Since the bowl of oatmeal at 40Â°C is hotter than the one at 25Â°C, it has more thermal energy."

Carbon monoxide is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	1	Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is produced by volcanic eruptions and wildfires. The chemical formula for carbon monoxide is CO.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms."	"You can tell whether carbon monoxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for carbon monoxide, CO, contains two atomic symbols: C for carbon and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that carbon monoxide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since carbon monoxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon monoxide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The chemical formula for carbon monoxide is CO, which indicates it is composed of two different elements, carbon (C) and oxygen (O). An elementary substance consists of only one type of atom, while a compound is made up of two or more different elements bonded together. Therefore, carbon monoxide, being made up of two different elements, is a compound."

"	"A red kangaroo's scientific name is Macropus rufus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus.
Lepus americanus is in the genus Lepus. The first word of its scientific name is Lepus. So, Lepus americanus and Macropus rufus are not in the same genus.
Lynx rufus and Macropus rufus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Lynx rufus and Macropus rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx, and Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus.
Macropus giganteus is in the genus Macropus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. So, Macropus giganteus and Macropus rufus are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 2

Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 440 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The speed of a motorboat is determined by the distance it covers over a given period of time. In this case, all three motorboats moved for the same amount of time, 10 hours. Therefore, the motorboat that covered the greatest distance moved at the highest speed. Thus, the motorboat that moved 440 miles south in 10 hours was moving at the highest speed."

Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans are not born knowing how to drive a car. Instead, many people learn how to drive when they are older. So, driving is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The ability to drive a car is not something that is biologically passed down from parent to child, so it is not an inherited trait.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a black coat, and the allele a is for a spotted coat.
Freya, a jaguar from this group, has a black coat. Freya has two alleles for a black coat."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Freya's observable version of the coat pattern trait is a black coat. So, Freya's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is a black coat.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Freya's phenotype is the observable characteristic which is a black coat in this case. The question asks for Freya's phenotype, which is the visible expression of her genetic makeup. Since Freya has a black coat, the correct answer is 'a black coat' (option 1). The presence of two alleles for a black coat just confirms her genetic predisposition for this phenotype."

The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype BB for the body color gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The fruit fly's genotype for the body color gene is BB. The fruit fly's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a gray body. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body.
To check this answer, consider whether the fruit fly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The fruit fly's genotype for the body color gene is BB, which is homozygous dominant. This indicates that the fly carries two copies of the dominant allele (B) for a gray body color. As dominant traits are expressed when at least one dominant allele is present, the fly's phenotype for the body color trait is a gray body, hence the answer is 0."

"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Where Sarah lives, winter is the rainiest season of the year.
This passage tells you about the usual precipitation where Sarah lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text provides information about the general weather pattern in Sarah's living area, specifically during the winter season. It states that winter is the rainiest season of the year, but does not specify the weather conditions of a particular day. This pattern of weather over a period of time refers to the climate.

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a floor lamp is 9 pounds.
9 ounces is too light and 9 tons is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A floor lamp typically weighs around 9 pounds, which makes it stable enough to stand on its own without being too heavy to move around. The option of 9 ounces is too light, as it would not provide enough stability for the lamp. On the other hand, 9 tons is excessively heavy for a household item like a floor lamp. Therefore, the most plausible choice is 9 pounds."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Based on the hint and solution provided, the strength of the magnetic force is dependent on the distance between magnets. If the magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker. Given this information, Pair 1 has a weaker magnetic force than Pair 2 because the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart from each other. Therefore, the correct answer is option 2, ""The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1""."

The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.

['spores', 'an adult moss plant']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a moss.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again."	"An adult moss plant produces eggs and sperm.
Spores may germinate and grow into an adult moss plant, but spores do not produce eggs and sperm themselves."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The adult moss plant is responsible for producing both eggs and sperm in its life cycle. This is a fundamental part of sexual reproduction in moss, which involves the fusion of both sperm and egg to produce a zygote. On the other hand, spores, which are produced by the moss in a different phase of its life cycle, do not produce eggs or sperm themselves but can grow into new moss plants."

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.

A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

Limestone is a rock that forms from ocean sediment. The sediment in limestone is made mostly of the shells of marine organisms. But the rock itself is not made by organisms. It forms deep below Earth's surface when layers of sediment are pressed together to form rock.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Limestone is a rock, not a mineral. This is because it is a composite material made mostly of calcite, a mineral, and it forms from the sediment of oceanic shells. Its formation process involves the compression of these sediments deep below the Earth's surface over a long period of time. Therefore, limestone is classified as a sedimentary rock."

My family arrives at the airport on time."	['future tense', 'present tense', 'past tense']	1		closed choice	grade3	language science	verbs	Verb tense	Is the sentence in the past, present, or future tense?	"Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in present tense. You can tell because it uses a present-tense verb, arrives. The verb ends in -s and tells you about something that is true or happening now.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""My family arrives at the airport on time"" is in present tense. This can be identified from the verb ""arrives"" which is in the present tense form. In English language, the present tense is used to talk about things that are happening right now, or things that are ongoing. Therefore, the correct answer is 1, which represents the present tense."

['sample A', 'sample B', 'neither; the samples have the same temperature']	1	The diagrams below show two pure samples of gas in identical closed, rigid containers. Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The question asks us to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in each sample and determine which sample has the higher temperature. According to the information provided, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A, because they have more mass. The temperature of a gas is directly proportional to its average kinetic energy, so sample B with the higher average kinetic energy must have the higher temperature. Thus, the answer is 1 - sample B."
	"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The alarm () the burglar, scaring him away."	['blared at', 'screamed at']	1		closed choice	grade8	language science	writing-strategies	Creative techniques	Use personification	"Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase screamed at. It describes the alarm as if it were a screaming person.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct choice is ""screamed at"" because personification is a figure of speech that gives human qualities to non-human objects or abstract ideas. While alarms can blare, they can't literally scream as this is a human trait. Therefore, the phrase ""screamed at"" personifies the alarm, making the sentence more vivid and expressive."

['repel', 'attract']	0	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
Both poles of each magnet line up with both poles of the other magnet. The north pole of each magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: It is stated that the north pole of each magnet is closest to the north pole of the other. As per the fundamental principles of magnetism, like poles repel each other. Therefore, these magnets will repel each other. Hence, the answer is 0, indicating ""repel""."

The words tip and lake don't rhyme. They end with different sounds."	"The words duck and truck rhyme. They both end with the uck sound.
The word hate does not rhyme. It ends with a different sound."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The words ""truck"" and ""duck"" both end with the ""uck"" sound, making them rhymes. On the other hand, the word ""hate"" ends with the ""ate"" sound which is different from the ""uck"" sound, making it not rhyme with the other two words. Therefore, the word that does not rhyme is ""hate""."

	Based on this information, what is Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait?	['green body feathers', 'blue body feathers']	1	"In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
Tiki is a budgerigar parakeet from this group. Tiki has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Tiki's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb. Tiki's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for blue body feathers. So, Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.
To check this answer, consider whether Tiki's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Tiki's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Tiki's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb. Each b allele is for blue body feathers, and Tiki has two of these b alleles. The b alleles are recessive, but since Tiki has two of them, there is no dominant allele present to override the recessive trait. This means Tiki's phenotype will reflect the recessive trait, which is blue body feathers."

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mom will open the jar of jelly"" is in the future tense. This is indicated by the use of the auxiliary verb ""will"" before the main verb ""open"". This construction is typically used in English to express an action that will happen in the future. Therefore, the correct answer is 1 - future tense."
	Select the part whose main job is to use energy from sunlight to make sugar in a plant cell.	['chromosomes', 'chloroplasts', 'cell membrane', 'vacuole']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Cells	Identify functions of plant cell parts	"Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts."	"Chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. First, chloroplasts capture energy from sunlight. Then, they use this energy to turn water and carbon dioxide gas into sugar, the plant cell's food.
A plant cell may have many chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose answer number 1 because chloroplasts are the part of a plant cell responsible for photosynthesis. They are the organelles that capture sunlight and use it to convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose, a type of sugar that the plant uses for food. This process is essential for the life cycle of the plant, and it wouldn't be possible without chloroplasts."

['dinosaur footprint', 'fern']	1	This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Fossils	Compare ages of fossils in a rock sequence	"A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The fern fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the dinosaur footprint fossil. So, the fern fossil is most likely younger than the dinosaur footprint fossil."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The fern fossil is likely younger according to the principle of superposition in geological strata. This principle states that in an undisturbed sequence of rocks, the youngest rocks are on top and the oldest are on the bottom. In the given hint, it was mentioned that the fern fossil is in a shallower layer than the dinosaur footprint fossil, indicating it is in a higher or more recent layer, thus it is younger."

11 pounds and 11 tons are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the mass of a can of soup is 11 ounces. This is because cans of soup typically weigh around this amount. In comparison, 11 pounds and 11 tons are both significantly heavier than a typical can of soup, suggesting that these choices are not correct. Therefore, the most appropriate option is 11 ounces."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two blocks of iron have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 95Â°F block is hotter than the 70Â°F block, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy the object possesses. Since both blocks have the same mass and are made from the same material, the only difference is their temperature. Therefore, the block with the higher temperature, in this case, the 8-kilogram block of iron at 95Â°F, has more thermal energy."
	Which block of steel has less thermal energy?	['the hotter block of steel', 'the colder block of steel']	1	Two 4-kilogram blocks of steel are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy."	The two blocks of steel are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder block of steel has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy it has. Therefore, between a hotter and colder block of steel, the colder one will have less thermal energy. This is especially true in this case as both blocks are identical in every other aspect, hence only the temperature will affect their thermal energy."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Scheherazade is ancient legend.
The Arabian Nights presents the ancient legend of how Scheherazade successfully postpones her imminent death by mesmerizing her captor with a thousand and one fascinating tales.
The allusion Scheherazade means a person who uses his or her arts to distract someone and avoid consequences."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The name Scheherazade is derived from the ancient legend ""Arabian Nights,"" not the Bible. Scheherazade is a character known for her storytelling abilities, used to captivate her captor and delay her execution. Thus, in the context given, Wanda's friends are humorously comparing her lengthy explanation to Scheherazade's tales, suggesting she's using her words to evade a situation or consequence."

There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage."	"At the current price, there are not enough cookies for sale. There are 20 boxes for sale, but 35 people want to buy a box.
So, there is a shortage of cookies."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the supply and demand of a product, in this case, chocolate chip cookies. The information provided states that there are 20 boxes of cookies available for sale, but there are 35 potential buyers, indicating a higher demand than supply. Therefore, the answer is a shortage (option 1) of chocolate chip cookies."

A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"

Hematite is a mineral.
A skull is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
A skull is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, a skull is not a mineral.
Quartz is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Minerals are defined by several characteristics, including being naturally occurring, inorganic, solid, with a definite chemical composition and an ordered internal structure. In this case, the skull is not a mineral because it is made by a living thing (organic) and it is not a pure substance. On the other hand, hematite and quartz meet all the characteristics of a mineral, hence they are minerals. Therefore, the skull (option 2) is the substance that is not a mineral."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The key factor determining the magnitude of the magnetic force is the size of the magnet. Although magnets in both pairs are made of the same material, the size of Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2, while the size of Magnet A remains the same in both pairs. This means that Pair 1 has a greater magnetic force than Pair 2. Regardless of whether the magnets attract or repel, the magnitude of the magnetic force depends on the size of the magnets."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

8 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The volume of a bathroom sink cannot be 8 milliliters because it is too small. A milliliter is a unit used to measure very small volumes like medicine doses. A bathroom sink, on the other hand, is much larger and so its volume would be measured in liters. Therefore, 8 liters is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a bathroom sink."

['a gas', 'a solid', 'a liquid']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"Ocean water is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour some ocean water into a bucket, the ocean water will take the shape of the bucket. But the ocean water will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Ocean water is a liquid according to the states of matter. It is not a solid because it does not have a fixed shape; rather, it takes the shape of whatever container it is put into. Also, it is not a gas because it does not have the ability to expand indefinitely and occupy the space it is given. In a liquid state, substances have a definite volume but no definite shape."

Bleaching hair is a ()."	['chemical change', 'physical change']	0		closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Bleaching hair is a chemical change. Hair contains colorful matter called pigment. The bleach reacts with the pigment and turns it into a different type of matter. The new matter gives the hair a lighter color than before.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Bleaching hair is a chemical change because it involves a reaction that alters the chemical structure of the hair's pigment. The bleach reacting with the pigment is a chemical process that changes the pigment into a different type of matter, which results in a lighter hair color. Unlike a physical change, this process is not easily reversible as it alters the hair's original state at a molecular level."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury"	The ad appeals to ethos, or character. It includes a recommendation from a respected organization.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The answer is ethos, or character, because the ad utilizes a recommendation from a respected organization to gain credibility and trust. Ethos is all about using credibility and authority to persuade. By using a respected organization's recommendation, the ad is appealing to the audience's sense of trust in that organization. This strategy leverages the character and credibility of the organization to make the ad more persuasive."

All three meatballs have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 17Â°C meatball is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly proportional to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the more thermal energy an object possesses. Since all the meatballs are identical and the only difference is their temperature, the meatball with the lowest temperature, which is 17Â°C, has the least thermal energy."

The chemical formula for 2-chloroethanol is C2H5ClO.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms."	"You can tell whether 2-chloroethanol is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for 2-chloroethanol, C2 H5 ClO, contains four atomic symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, Cl for chlorine, and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that 2-chloroethanol is composed of four chemical elements bonded together.
Since 2-chloroethanol is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, 2-chloroethanol is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: 2-Chloroethanol is considered a compound because it is made up of more than one type of element. The atomic symbols in its chemical formula, C2H5ClO, represent carbon, hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen. These four elements are bonded together to form 2-Chloroethanol, which is the defining characteristic of a compound. Therefore, the answer is option 0, a compound."

The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The magnetic force is dependent on the distance between the two magnets. The farther apart the magnets are, the weaker the magnetic force between them. In this scenario, Pair 2 magnets are further apart compared to Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2."

""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion turn the other cheek is the Bible.
In the Bible, Jesus counsels his followers to resist retaliation. He says that if they are struck on the right cheek, they shouldn't lash out; instead, they should turn the other cheek toward their attacker.
The allusion turn the other cheek means to respond without aggression."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The phrase ""turn the other cheek"" is a well-known allusion from the Bible, specifically from the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew. Jesus advises his followers to avoid retaliation and to offer the other cheek if they are slapped on one. In this context, it means to respond without aggression or to refrain from revenge, which is why the answer is 1, the Bible."

['a liquid', 'a solid', 'a gas']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

	Which watermelon has less thermal energy?	['the colder watermelon', 'the hotter watermelon']	0	Two watermelons are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy."	The two watermelons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder watermelon has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature of an object, the more thermal energy it possesses because the particles are moving more quickly and colliding more frequently. Hence, a hotter watermelon has more thermal energy than a colder one. Therefore, the correct answer is the colder watermelon (choice 0)."

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal."	"Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The diagram and description indicate that initially, there were more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than on the left.

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

SOLUTION: A marble is not a mineral because it is made by humans. Minerals, by definition, are naturally occurring substances that are not made or significantly altered by human activity. Therefore, despite being a solid, a marble does not fit the criteria to be classified as a mineral due to its human-made origin.

A shopping bag holding 9 pounds of food is heavier than a shopping bag holding 7 pounds of food. So, the bag holding 9 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other bag."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The force required to lift an object is directly proportional to its weight. This means that a heavier object requires a larger force to lift it. Given that the shopper lifts each bag at the same speed, the bag holding 9 pounds of food requires a larger force to lift than the bag holding 7 pounds of food. Therefore, the correct answer is the bag holding 9 pounds of food."

"	"The text argues that we must invite the manager because we can't not invite her. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The text presents a circular reasoning fallacy. The claim being made is that the manager must be invited to the party, and the evidence provided to support this claim is essentially a reiteration of the claim itself: that not inviting her isn't a valid option. There's no new or independent evidence provided to support the necessity of her invitation. The argument simply restates the claim in different words, which is the definition of circular reasoning."
	Which expression of thanks is more formal?	['Thank you for taking the time to speak with me.', 'It was super nice talking with you. Thanks for fitting me in!']	0		closed choice	grade11	language science	writing-strategies	Audience, purpose, and tone	Which text is most formal?	"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The first expression of thanks is more formal. It avoids imprecise, conversational language (super nice, fitting me in).	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The expression ""Thank you for taking the time to speak with me"" is more formal than the second one. This is because it uses precise and business-like language which is commonly found in formal settings. On the other hand, the second expression ""It was super nice talking with you. Thanks for fitting me in!"" uses casual and informal language which is often used in relaxed and informal contexts. Therefore, the first expression is more formal."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies

Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of shale match the properties of a rock. So, shale is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Shale is a type of sedimentary rock, not a mineral. While it is solid, not made by organisms, and found in nature, similar to minerals, it differs from minerals in that it does not have a fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance. It is composed of fine sediment grains, which is a characteristic of rocks, specifically sedimentary rocks."

Millie, a cat from this group, has agouti fur. Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur (A). So, Millie's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage clearly states that Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur, denoted as 'A'. In genetics, the combination of alleles that an organism has for a particular trait is its genotype. Therefore, having two 'A' alleles, Millie's genotype for the agouti fur gene would be 'AA'.

98.6Â°F | Body temperature | 37Â°C
68Â°F | Room temperature | 20Â°C
32Â°F | Water freezes | 0Â°C
"	"The better estimate for the temperature of the air on a hot day is 38Â°C.
38Â°F is too cold."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: In the context of describing a hot day, 38Â°C fits better. This is because 38Â°C is equivalent to about 100Â°F, which is considered hot in most climates. On the other hand, 38Â°F is just above freezing and would not be described as hot. Therefore, the correct choice is 1, which represents 38Â°C."

['yes', 'no']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.	yes or no	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	Ferns do not produce seeds. Mature ferns produce spores, and heart-shaped plants produce eggs and sperm.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The correct answer is 'no'. Ferns do not produce seeds, which is a characteristic of gymnosperms and angiosperms. Instead, ferns reproduce through a process involving spores. These spores grow into heart-shaped plants that produce eggs and sperm, which eventually develop into mature ferns. This is a unique aspect of the fern life cycle."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The hint and solution indicate that distance impacts the strength of the magnetic force between magnets, with a greater distance resulting in a weaker force. As there is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2, the magnetic force would be weaker in Pair 1. This aligns with choice 2, stating that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1."
	Which is a compound sentence?

"A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.

Monica can eat the leftover tomato soup, or she can make herself a tuna sandwich."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A compound sentence is defined as a sentence that has at least two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). The first sentence ""Monica can eat the leftover tomato soup, or she can make herself a tuna sandwich."" fits this definition as it has two independent clauses: ""Monica can eat the leftover tomato soup"" and ""she can make herself a tuna sandwich"" which are joined by the coordinating conjunction 'or'. Therefore, it is the compound sentence."

Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. The paper changes into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	Breaking a pencil is a physical change. The pencil gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Breaking a pencil is a physical change because it doesn't change the substance's identity. The pieces are still made of the same matter that the pencil was originally made of. A chemical change, on the other hand, would involve a change in the substance's composition or identity. Therefore, the correct answer is 0 - physical change."

The rock hyrax has short legs. It is not adapted for flight."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The gray-headed albatross is the animal that is also adapted for flight. This is because, as stated in the text, the albatross has long, powerful wings, a characteristic similar to the great blue heron, which is known to be adapted for flight. On the other hand, the rock hyrax has short legs and is not adapted for flight, making the albatross the correct choice."
	Which meatball has more thermal energy?	['the hotter meatball', 'the colder meatball']	0	Two meatballs are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two meatballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter meatball has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to temperature, meaning the hotter an object is, the more thermal energy it has. Since the two meatballs are identical in every way except for their temperature, the hotter meatball possesses more thermal energy. This is because it has more kinetic energy from the movement of its particles due to its higher temperature."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two blocks of steel have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 300Â°F block is colder than the 335Â°F block, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly proportional to temperature. This means that an object with a higher temperature will have more thermal energy than an object with a lower temperature, assuming other factors like mass and material are constant. In this case, both blocks are made of steel and have the same mass, but the block at 300Â°F is at a lower temperature than the block at 335Â°F. Therefore, the 9-kilogram block of steel at a temperature of 300Â°F has less thermal energy."

"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
It has not rained in over a week at Lindsey's house.
This passage tells you about the precipitation last week at Lindsey's house. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The passage describes a specific instance of weather conditions at Lindsey's house, stating that ""it has not rained in over a week."" This information pertains to a particular time, which aligns with the definition of weather. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere over short periods of time, unlike climate which refers to the average weather conditions over a long period.

['Antarctica', 'South America', 'North America']	0		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0Â° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180Â°E and 180Â°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0Â° longitude. It intersects Antarctica. It does not intersect South America or North America.	"ANSWER: (0)
SOLUTION: The Prime Meridian, a line of longitude marked as 0 degrees, passes through Greenwich, London in the UK. When looking at the world map, it vertically runs from the North Pole to the South Pole, passing through Europe and Africa, and finally intersecting Antarctica. It does not pass through either South or North America, hence option 0 is the correct choice."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of purple particles."	"ANSWER: (2) Solution B
SOLUTION: Based on the given hint and solution, it is clear that the concentration of a solution is determined by the number of solute particles present in each milliliter of the solvent. In this case, the purple particles represent the solute. The task states that Solution B has more purple particles per milliliter, indicating that it has a higher concentration of purple particles.

Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The scar on Kyle's right hand is an acquired trait. This is because scars are generally the result of injuries or accidents that occur during a person's lifetime, not something passed down genetically from parents to children. Therefore, the scar would be considered an environmental influence, making it an acquired trait."

Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One duck moved 755 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other duck moved 970 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each duck spent the same amount of time moving. The duck that moved 755 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The speed of an object is simply the distance it has traveled divided by the time it took to travel that distance. Both ducks traveled for the same amount of time, 10 hours, but the first duck only managed to cover 755 kilometers while the other covered 970 kilometers.

Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:

SOLUTION: In the first sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is clearly referring to the sedan that Dave found in the classified ads. However, in the second sentence, the pronoun ""it"" is vague and could be referring to either the sedan or the Bluetooth. As the Bluetooth cannot be ""fixed"", logically it should refer to the sedan, but grammatically it is unclear. This makes the pronoun reference vague and the sentence potentially confusing."

Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine touching the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the plastic bag is smoother. If you touch a plastic bag, it will not feel rough."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A plastic bag is chosen as smoother because, by its nature, plastic is a material that is typically slick and without texture, thereby providing a smooth surface. On the other hand, burlap sack is made of a coarse material that is woven, creating a rough texture. Therefore, when comparing a plastic bag to a burlap sack, the plastic bag is smoother."

['Australia', 'South America', 'Africa']	2		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0Â° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180Â°E and 180Â°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0Â° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or South America.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The Prime Meridian, also known as the 0-degree longitude, passes through Greenwich, London, UK, and continues through both the northern and southern hemispheres, intersecting with the African Continent. It does not go through Australia or South America, which are located in the eastern and western hemispheres, respectively. Therefore, the correct answer is Africa."

"	The text argues that Senator Pena hates children, because she wants to cut education funding. However, the fact that Senator Pena wants to cut education funding doesn't necessarily suggest that she hates children. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text misrepresents Senator Pena's position of cutting funding to early childhood education programs as a sign of her hating children. It exaggerates her stance to make it easier to argue against, which is the definition of a straw man fallacy.

<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=355x307 at 0x313328830>	"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	['false', 'true']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The statement is false. The calculation shows that Jupiter's volume is not more than 10,000 times the volume of Mars. In fact, when we calculate 10,000 times the volume of Mars (1.63 x 10^15 km^3), it is larger than the volume of Jupiter (1.43 x 10^15 km^3). Therefore, the given statement is incorrect."

SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the average kinetic energies of gas particles in two samples and determining which sample has a higher temperature. The solution states that the particles in sample B have a higher average speed, and thus, a higher average kinetic energy than those in sample A. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles, it follows that sample B, with the higher average kinetic energy, has a higher temperature.

A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a hiking trail is 3 kilometers.
3 millimeters, 3 centimeters, and 3 meters are all too short."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the length of a hiking trail is 3 kilometers. A hiking trail would be expected to be a considerable distance, as hiking involves prolonged walking typically on country or forest paths. Therefore, options suggesting the length as 3 millimeters, 3 centimeters, and 3 meters are all far too short for a hiking trail. Thus, the only appropriate choice is 3 kilometers."

A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"An axolotl's scientific name is Ambystoma mexicanum. The first word of its scientific name is Ambystoma.
Lissotriton helveticus is in the genus Lissotriton. The first word of its scientific name is Lissotriton. So, Lissotriton helveticus and Ambystoma mexicanum are not in the same genus.
Ambystoma texanum is in the genus Ambystoma. The first word of its scientific name is Ambystoma. So, Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma mexicanum are in the same genus.
Taricha torosa is in the genus Taricha. The first word of its scientific name is Taricha. So, Taricha torosa and Ambystoma mexicanum are not in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying the organism in the same genus as the axolotl. The scientific name of the axolotl is Ambystoma mexicanum, and the first part of the name, Ambystoma, denotes the genus.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task is about the behavior of magnets when placed close to each other. Magnets attract when opposite poles (north and south) are close to each other. As the hint indicates, the north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other, meaning the poles are different. Therefore, these magnets will attract each other."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each mountain biker moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One mountain biker moved 135 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other mountain biker moved 105 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 135 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by dividing the distance travelled by the time it took to travel that distance. Both bikers travelled for the same amount of time, thus the biker who travelled a greater distance would have a higher speed. In this case, the mountain biker who moved 135 kilometers in 5 hours travelled a greater distance than the one who moved 105 kilometers in the same amount of time, thus they were moving at a higher speed."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of particles in a gas is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Since each particle in the two samples has the same mass, the average kinetic energy can be determined by the speed of the particles. As stated, the particles in sample A have a higher average speed, hence, a higher kinetic energy. Therefore, sample A must have the higher temperature."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

Jupiter is made mainly of gas. So, the largest planet is made mainly of gas."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The statement is false. The largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter, which is primarily composed of gas, not ice. This is based on the comparison of volumes given in the context, where Jupiter's volume has the highest exponent, signifying it as the largest planet.

You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.

Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Chanel's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body. So, Chanel's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the concept of phenotype which refers to the physical characteristics or traits of an organism as a result of its genetic makeup. In this case, Chanel's phenotype is identified by the physical trait of having a hairless body. This is an observable characteristic, hence, the answer is 'a hairless body' which corresponds to choice 0. The genetic makeup (bb) is not the phenotype, but the genotype, which is why choice 1 is incorrect."

false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences
straw man | a misrepresentation of an opponent's position that makes it easier to argue against
"	"The text argues that Mr. Harding can quit smoking because he is able to stop. However, the ""evidence"" is just a restatement of the claim itself. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as circular reasoning."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The text claims that Mr. Harding can quit smoking because he has the ability to stop. This argument is a perfect example of circular reasoning because the supporting evidence is merely a reiteration of the initial claim. This kind of logical fallacy restates the argument rather than actually providing valid proof. Hence, the logical fallacy used here is circular reasoning."

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.

A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web.

The only arrow pointing from the orca leads to the sea cucumber. No arrows point from the sea cucumber to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the orca to the bat star..	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because based on the information provided, matter can move from the black rockfish to the bat star via the kelp bass in the food web. The orca, on the other hand, does not have a direct or indirect path to the bat star. The matter from the orca only moves to the sea cucumber and there are no subsequent arrows from the sea cucumber to any other organism, including the bat star."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion by the skin of his teeth is the Bible.
In the Bible, Job complains to God about his hardships, saying that both strangers and those he loves have turned against him. He says, ""My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth."" Scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the phrase, but many claim that Job is saying that he narrowly escaped death.
The allusion by the skin of his teeth means just barely."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phrase ""by the skin of his teeth"" is an allusion to the Bible, specifically the Book of Job. This is a well-known phrase in English that means barely or narrowly escaping a situation. In the context given, Baldwin narrowly escaped from the mountain, hence the allusion to the Bible. Hence, option 0 is the correct answer."

['the cup of black tea with more thermal energy', 'the cup of black tea with less thermal energy']	1	Two 250-gram cups of black tea are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two cups of black tea are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The temperature of an object is determined by the average kinetic energy of its particles, which is related to its thermal energy. If two objects are identical in every aspect except for their thermal energies, the one with less thermal energy will have a lower average kinetic energy and therefore a lower temperature. Thus, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature."

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in past tense. You can tell because it uses a past-tense verb, signed. The verb ends in -ed and tells you about something that has already happened.	"ANSWER: (2) past tense
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mr. Cho signed his name on the letter"" is written in the past tense. This is determined by the verb 'signed' which is in the past form. The past tense is commonly identified by the -ed ending in regular verbs, indicating actions that have already occurred. Therefore, the sentence refers to an event that happened in the past."
	Based on this information, what is Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait?	['having horns', 'not having horns']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Zelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Zelda's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Zelda's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Zelda's genotype Hh consists of one dominant allele (H) and one recessive allele (h). In this scenario, the gene for not having horns (H) is dominant over the gene for having horns (h). Therefore, even though Zelda carries the gene for horns, the dominant gene for not having horns will determine her phenotype. Thus, Zelda's phenotype is 'not having horns'."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.

60 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The better estimate for the mass of a dinner fork is 60 grams because a typical dinner fork is very light, and thus, it would not weigh 60 kilograms, which is a weight more appropriate for heavier objects like a small car or a large animal. Therefore, the other option of 60 kilograms is highly impractical and unrealistic for the weight of a dinner fork."

Splash, a betta from this group, has mostly plain scales. Splash has two alleles for mostly plain scales."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Splash has two alleles for mostly plain scales (i). So, Splash's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is ii.	"ANSWER: 0

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them.

But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The answer is 2 because according to the solution, the magnitude of the magnetic force is dependent on the distance between the magnets. The closer the magnets are to each other, the stronger the magnetic force between them. In Pair 2, the magnets are closer together than in Pair 1, therefore the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. The fact that the magnets in Pair 1 repel and those in Pair 2 attract does not affect the magnitude of the force, only the direction."

A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The browning of a banana is a chemical change because it involves a reaction with oxygen in the air, which leads to a transformation in the chemical properties of the banana. It's not merely a change in the physical state of the banana, but a change in its chemical composition. A physical change would involve a change in the state or form of the matter, without altering the chemical nature of the substance. Therefore, the answer is 0 - chemical change."

An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the bear sedge.
The grizzly bear has two arrows pointing to it. One arrow starts from the bilberry. The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. The other arrow pointing to the grizzly bear starts from the barren-ground caribou. The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the grizzly bear.
The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bear sedge to the bilberry.There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the short-tailed weasel: bear sedge->brown lemming->short-tailed weasel. There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the Arctic fox: bear sedge->brown lemming->Arctic fox. There is one path matter can take from the bear sedge to the rough-legged hawk: bear sedge->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk."	"ANSWER: (2) short-tailed weasel
SOLUTION: The matter that was once part of the bear sedge can move to the short-tailed weasel through the food chain. In the food web, the bear sedge is eaten by the brown lemming, which is then eaten by the short-tailed weasel. Therefore, the matter from the bear sedge can ultimately end up in the short-tailed weasel.

SOLUTION: The text is an example of circular reasoning because it uses the claim to support the same claim. The argument is that Senator Robinson isn't lying about caring for her constituents because she doesn't lie to people she cares about.

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"An eastern gray kangaroo's scientific name is Macropus giganteus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus.
Equus grevyi is in the genus Equus. The first word of its scientific name is Equus. So, Equus grevyi and Macropus giganteus are not in the same genus.
Equus quagga is in the genus Equus. The first word of its scientific name is Equus. So, Equus quagga and Macropus giganteus are not in the same genus.
Macropus agilis is in the genus Macropus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. So, Macropus agilis and Macropus giganteus are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the question asked for the organism in the same genus as the eastern gray kangaroo. Given the scientific name of the eastern gray kangaroo, Macropus giganteus, we know that the genus is Macropus. Therefore, the organism that shares the same genus is Macropus agilis, which is choice number 1. The other two choices, Equus quagga and Equus grevyi, belong to the genus Equus, not Macropus."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description

"	The text argues that Marie must watch reality television, because her sister watches reality television. However, even though Marie's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Marie does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text assumes that Marie watches reality television just because her sister does. This is an example of guilt by association, where the actions or characteristics of one person are applied to another simply because they are related or connected in some way. The argument doesn't provide any direct evidence about Marie's viewing habits, but rather tries to discredit her claim by associating her with her sister's habits."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of siltstone match the properties of a rock. So, siltstone is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Siltstone is categorized as a rock due to its solid structure and the fact that it is composed of fine sediment grains. It lacks a fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance, which is typical of rocks. Additionally, it is naturally occurring and not made by living organisms, further supporting it being classified as a rock."

The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of an adult alligator is 14 feet.
14 inches is too short."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: An adult alligator can reach up to 14 feet in length. This is a well-known fact in the field of herpetology and can be easily verified through a quick online search or a visit to a nearby zoo or wildlife reserve. Alligators are large, powerful reptiles and 14 inches is far too small to be the length of a fully grown specimen. Therefore, the better estimate for the length of an adult alligator is 14 feet."
	Which is a simple sentence?	['Albert stacked a crate of oranges on top of the crate of lemons and checked both crates off his order sheet.', 'Brennan walked through Paris in a daze because he was still suffering from jet lag.']	0		closed choice	grade5	language science	grammar	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence simple, compound, or complex?	"A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.

Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw a flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard the rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction such as after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, or while.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids."	"The second sentence is the simple sentence. It is a single independent clause.
Albert stacked a crate of oranges on top of the crate of lemons and checked both crates off his order sheet."	"ANSWER: None
SOLUTION: Neither of the provided sentences is a simple sentence. A simple sentence is a sentence that consists of one independent clause and no dependent clause. The first sentence has two actions - stacking and checking, connected by 'and'. The second sentence is a complex sentence because it has an independent clause and a dependent clause ('because he was still suffering from jet lag').

['Lynx lynx', 'Macropus rufus', 'Halichoeres hortulanus']	0	This organism is a bobcat. Its scientific name is Lynx rufus.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx.
Halichoeres hortulanus is in the genus Halichoeres. The first word of its scientific name is Halichoeres. So, Halichoeres hortulanus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.
Lynx lynx is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx lynx and Lynx rufus are in the same genus.
Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Macropus rufus and Lynx rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus, and Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The answer is Lynx lynx because it is in the same genus as the bobcat, Lynx rufus. In scientific nomenclature, the first word in an organism's name denotes the genus. Therefore, Lynx lynx and Lynx rufus belong to the same genus, Lynx. The other options, Macropus rufus and Halichoeres hortulanus, belong to different genera and are therefore not in the same genus as the bobcat."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The correct answer is ""physical change"". This is because when a ceramic plate is broken, it changes its shape and size but its molecular structure remains the same. In a physical change, an object's physical properties may alter, but its chemical makeup does not. In other words, it is still ceramic even after being broken. A chemical change, on the other hand, would involve a change in the object's chemical composition, which is not the case here."

If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

Someone had better turn on the heat ironically suggests that the temperature was too warm. Sasha did not think that more heat was needed; she was already sweating."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The text uses verbal irony to imply that the temperature is already too warm, contrary to what Sasha literally says. Her statement about needing more heat is ironic because she is already sweating, which is a sign of being hot. Therefore, she is implying that the temperature is too high, not too low.

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	In this experiment, Hansen investigated whether adding salt to water affects how quickly spaghetti cooks. The pots with pure water did not have salt. So, they were part of a control group.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: In scientific experiments, a control group refers to a group in which no factors are altered in order to provide a standard of comparison for the experimental group where the variable being tested is changed. In this case, the pots with pure water were not altered with the addition of salt, thereby serving as the control group.

The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large frilled neck might help an animal appear dangerous to its predators. A long neck might help an animal get food from tall trees."	"Look at the picture of the spectacled cobra.
When frightened, the spectacled cobra can spread out its hood to appear larger and more dangerous. If a predator is nearby, the hood can help scare it away.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: Cutting an apple and shaking up salad dressing are both physical changes. This is because they do not result in the formation of new substances. In other words, the changes only affect the form or state of the substances involved, not their composition. Therefore, the answer is ""(3) Both are only physical changes."""
	Which word does not rhyme?	['cop', 'top', 'mad']	2		closed choice	grade1	language science	phonological-awareness	Rhyming	Which word does not rhyme?	"Rhyming words are words that end with the same sound.
The words tip and slip rhyme. They both end with the ip sound.
The words lake and make rhyme. They both end with the ake sound.
The words tip and lake don't rhyme. They end with different sounds."	"The words top and cop rhyme. They both end with the op sound.
The word mad does not rhyme. It ends with a different sound."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying the word that does not rhyme with the others. Rhyming words typically have the same ending sound. In this case, the words 'cop' and 'top' both end in the 'op' sound, thus they rhyme. On the other hand, the word 'mad' ends with the 'ad' sound, which makes it different from the other two. Therefore, the word 'mad' does not rhyme with 'cop' and 'top'."

	Is flying a plane a good or a service?	['a service', 'a good']	0		closed choice	grade2	social science	economics	Economics	Goods and services	"Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.
A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether flying a plane is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is flying a plane something you can touch? No.
Is flying a plane a job you might pay someone else to do? Yes.
So, flying a plane is a service."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Flying a plane is considered a service because it involves expertise and skills provided by a person, usually a pilot, in exchange for payment. It's not a physical product or commodity that you can touch or receive, like a good. Therefore, the act of flying a plane is a service."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task is assessing the understanding of the relationship between kinetic energy, mass, speed, and temperature in gas particles. It is stated that each particle in sample A has more mass and a higher average speed than each particle in sample B, thus resulting in higher kinetic energy. Since the average kinetic energy of a sample's particles is directly proportional to its temperature, sample A must have a higher temperature."

Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to watch a movie at the theater is 3 hours.
3 minutes is too fast."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The typical runtime for a movie at the theater is around 1.5 to 3 hours, depending on the specific film. Therefore, 3 hours is a reasonable estimate for the time it takes to watch a movie at the theater. On the other hand, 3 minutes is far too short for any movie, making it an unrealistic estimate.

The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

a copper statue turning green"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Both the browning of a banana slice and the greening of a copper statue are examples of chemical changes. This is because in both instances, the original material reacts with oxygen (a process known as oxidation) to form a new substance. This new substance has different properties from the original, hence indicating a chemical change. Thus, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

	Which cotton ball has more thermal energy?	['the hotter cotton ball', 'the colder cotton ball']	0	Two cotton balls are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70Â°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70Â°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two cotton balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter cotton ball has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature. Since both cotton balls have the same mass and are made of the same material, the one with the higher temperature will have more thermal energy. Therefore, the hotter cotton ball has more thermal energy than the colder one."

Nico has one allele for a hairy body and one allele for a hairless body."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Nico has one allele for a hairy body (B) and one allele for a hairless body (b). So, Nico's genotype for the body hair gene is Bb.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Nico's genotype for the body hair gene is Bb. This answer is derived from the information given that Nico has one allele for a hairy body (B) and one allele for a hairless body (b).

A cart holding 82 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 59 pounds. So, the cart holding 82 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other cart."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The force required to move an object is directly proportional to its mass. Therefore, a heavier object requires more force to move it than a lighter one. In this case, a cart holding 82 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 59 pounds. Thus, the cart holding 82 pounds requires a larger force to move it at the same speed."

It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Gypsum is a mineral.
An antler is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, an antler is not a mineral.
Baryte is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: An antler is not a mineral because it is not a pure substance. Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic, solid substances with a specific chemical formula and atomic structure. Baryte and Gypsum, on the other hand, fit these criteria, thus they are classified as minerals. Therefore, the substance that is not a mineral is an antler."
	Which is a run-on sentence?	['Beavers build a dam, they use sticks and branches.', 'Our cabin has bunk beds for the kids.']	0		closed choice	grade3	language science	writing-strategies	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is it a complete sentence or a run-on?	"A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside."	Beavers build a dam, they use sticks and branches is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined by just a comma: Beavers build a dam and They use sticks and branches.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: I chose this response because a run-on sentence is a common error that occurs when two independent clauses are combined without a proper conjunction or punctuation. In the sentence ""Beavers build a dam, they use sticks and branches,"" it contains two independent thoughts or sentences that are joined by a mere comma, making it a run-on sentence. The other sentence is structured correctly, making choice 0 the right answer."
	What is the mass of an eraser?	['1 ounce', '1 pound', '1 ton']	0	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of mass	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of an eraser is 1 ounce.
1 pound and 1 ton are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The mass of an eraser is not standard as it depends on the size and material of the eraser. However, in general, an eraser is a small object and is not likely to weigh 1 pound or 1 ton. These weights are more suited for larger or denser objects. Given the options, 1 ounce is the most reasonable estimate for the mass of an eraser."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	['After Mr. Vance finished performing with Mr. Patton, Mary went up and thanked him.', 'Mary went up and thanked Mr. Vance after he finished performing with Mr. Patton.']	0		closed choice	grade7	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns and antecedents	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun him could refer to Mr. Vance or Mr. Patton.
After Mr. Vance finished performing with Mr. Patton, Mary went up and thanked him.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Mary went up and thanked Mr. Vance after he finished performing with Mr. Patton."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first sentence contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun ""him"" could refer to either Mr. Vance or Mr. Patton, making it unclear whom Mary thanked. In contrast, the second sentence clears up the ambiguity by directly associating the pronoun 'he' with Mr. Vance, leaving no room for confusion."
	How long is a hummingbird's beak?	['2 centimeters', '2 kilometers']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a hummingbird's beak is 2 centimeters.
2 kilometers is too long."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The better estimate for the length of a hummingbird's beak is 2 centimeters. This is because hummingbirds are very small birds and their beaks are typically around 1 to 2 centimeters in length, depending on the species. A length of 2 kilometers is an unrealistic size for any bird's beak, let alone a hummingbird's. Therefore, the correct choice is 2 centimeters."

Figure: spotted deer."	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: beaks, mouths, and necks	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the spotted deer.
The spotted deer has long jaws and flat teeth. Its mouth is adapted to eat plant matter. The long jaws can help the spotted deer reach grass. The flat teeth can help it cut and grind up the food into soft pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The giraffe has long jaws and flat teeth. Its mouth is adapted to eat plant matter.
The cougar has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is not adapted to eat plant matter. The cougar uses its mouth to eat other animals."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The giraffe is the correct answer because, like the spotted deer, it has long jaws and flat teeth which are adaptations for eating plant matter. This is stated in the text. In contrast, the cougar has a large mouth and sharp teeth which are adaptations for eating other animals, not plant matter. Therefore, the giraffe's mouth is more closely adapted to eating plant matter."

Zinc is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	0	Zinc is a metal that is used to make batteries and musical instruments. The chemical formula for zinc is Zn.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether zinc is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for zinc is Zn. This formula contains one symbol: Zn. So, the formula tells you that zinc is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zinc is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The explanation is straightforward. The chemical formula for zinc is Zn, which only contains one symbol, indicating that it is composed of one chemical element. Substances made of a single chemical element are classified as elementary substances. Thus, zinc is an elementary substance, not a compound."
	What can a fertilized egg become?	['a cone', 'a seed', 'pollen']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Plants	Describe and construct conifer life cycles	"Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant."	"Fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
A seed can grow into a new plant, which can grow pollen and cones. But a fertilized egg does not become pollen or a cone."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: A fertilized egg in plants, also known as a zygote, develops into a seed. This is a basic principle of plant reproduction. While pollen is involved in the fertilization process, it is not the end product. Cones, on the other hand, are structures in some plants that aid in reproduction but are not a direct result of a fertilized egg. Therefore, the correct answer is a seed."

['a liquid', 'a solid', 'a gas']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"Gasoline is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour gasoline into a different container, the gasoline will take the size and shape of that container."	"ANSWER: (0)
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because gasoline is indeed a liquid. It is not a solid as it does not have a fixed shape and volume, and it is not a gas as it does not expand to fill its container. When you pour gasoline, it takes the shape of the container, which is a characteristic of a liquid. It also has distinct liquid properties such as being able to flow and having a fixed volume."

It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Turquoise has all the properties of a mineral. So, turquoise is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task is asking whether turquoise is a mineral or not. By analyzing the hint provided, we can see that turquoise meets all the criteria of a mineral. It is a pure substance, it is found in nature, it's not made by organisms, it's solid, and it has a fixed crystal structure. Thus, the answer is ""yes"", turquoise is a mineral."

['C', 'C2', 'CCl4', 'CCl5']	2		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Match chemical formulas to ball-and-stick models	"Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.
Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.
In chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.
The symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance."	"C is the symbol for carbon. Cl is the symbol for chlorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms.
The chemical formula will contain the symbols C and Cl. There is one carbon atom, so C will not have a subscript. There are four chlorine atoms, so Cl will have a subscript of 4.
The correct formula is CCl4.
The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above."	"ANSWER: (2)
SOLUTION: The task involves determining the chemical formula of a molecule. The molecule is described as having one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms. Therefore, the formula would be CCl4. This corresponds to choice (2). The other choices do not correctly represent the composition of the molecule as described."

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of a gas particle is directly proportional to its temperature. The hint indicates that each particle in sample B has a greater mass and average speed compared to those in sample A which suggests that they have a higher average kinetic energy. Since temperature is directly correlated with the average kinetic energy of particles, sample B must have a higher temperature."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The size of the magnets influences the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Given that both magnets are made of the same material, the smaller the magnets, the smaller the force. Since Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is smaller than in Pair 2.

You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	In this experiment, Ellen investigated whether spraying air plants affects their growth. The plants that were only soaked in water were not sprayed. So, they were part of a control group.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The control group in an experiment is the group that does not receive the experimental treatment and is used as a benchmark to measure how the other tested subjects do. In this experiment, Ellen wanted to test if spraying air plants would affect their growth. The plants that were only soaked in water and not sprayed every day formed the control group.

Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two mugs of cider have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 35Â°C mug of cider is colder than the 55Â°C mug of cider, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to temperature. The higher the temperature of an object, the greater its thermal energy. In this task, both mugs have the same mass and are made of the same material but differ in temperature. Therefore, the mug with a lower temperature, the 35Â°C mug of cider, has less thermal energy."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.

It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The first holiday greeting is more formal. It uses more ceremonious language (may your Thanksgiving be filled). The other holiday greeting uses slang (your gang, have a blast) and sounds more casual.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first holiday greeting is more formal, as it utilizes a more dignified and traditional language. Phrases like ""may your Thanksgiving be filled"" suggest a formal and respectful tone. On the other hand, the second greeting uses informal language and colloquial terms such as ""your gang"" and ""have a blast"", which makes it sound more casual and informal."
	Which word is not like the others?	['fly', 'bee', 'pig', 'ant']	2		closed choice	grade1	language science	vocabulary	Categories	Which word is not like the others?	"Some words are alike. They go together in a group.
Red, blue, and green go together. They are colors.
Mom, dad, grandma, and grandpa go together. They are people in a family."	Bee, ant, and fly go together. They are bugs. Pig is not a bug, so it is not like the other words.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The words bee, ant, and fly are all related as they refer to insects. In contrast, the word pig refers to a mammal which is an entirely different category of animal. Therefore, the word ""pig"" is not like the others."
	"Does this passage describe the weather or the climate?

Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Pedro put on an extra pair of socks this morning because it was so cold.
This passage tells you about the temperature this morning where Pedro lives. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The passage describes a specific instance of Pedro experiencing cold weather, which is a daily atmospheric condition. Climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a specific area. Therefore, the passage is describing the weather, not the climate."
	"Which word would you find on a dictionary page with the following guide words?

The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The girl's dad pushes the bike away from himself. So, the girl rides forward. The direction of the push is away from the dad's hands.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The dad is pushing the girl's bike, causing it to move forward. This indicates that the force exerted by the dad is directed away from his hands. The direction of movement of an object is always along the direction of the force applied. Therefore, the direction of the push is away from the dad's hands."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
roasting a marshmallow over a campfire
grilling a hamburger"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Grilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both roasting a marshmallow over a campfire and grilling a hamburger involve the application of heat which leads to a chemical change in the substances - marshmallow and meat, respectively. The heat causes the transformation of the raw or original state of these substances into a new, altered state which is evident in the changes in color, texture, and flavor. So, the correct answer is that both are caused by heating."

['a liquid', 'a gas', 'a solid']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A marble is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A marble can be made of clear or colored glass."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: A marble is a solid because it retains its shape and volume regardless of its environment and it doesn't flow like a liquid or spread out like a gas. Solids have a definite shape and volume, and they are not easily compressible. Moreover, marbles are typically made from materials like glass, which is a solid substance."

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses ironic in its traditional sense: contrary to what was intended, often in an amusing way. It's ironic because Terrence tried to get away from the snow but found himself in a snowstorm regardless.
Last winter, Terrence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, a rare snowstorm happened to hit Florida that week.
The first text uses ironic in its nontraditional sense: marked by coincidence. It was a coincidence that Terrence's friends were in Florida the week before.
Last winter, Terrence took a vacation to Florida to escape Boston's cold, snowy weather. In an ironic twist, he just missed a few of his college friends, who had been in Florida the previous week.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word ironic because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The first text uses the term 'ironic' in its traditional sense. Traditionally, irony refers to a situation that is strange or funny because things happen in a way that seems to be the opposite of what you expected. In the first text, Terrence went to Florida to escape the cold weather in Boston, but ironically, he encountered a snowstorm in Florida, which is what he was trying to avoid. This is contrary to what was expected, making it an example of irony."

SOLUTION: The metal horseshoe is the hardest among the options. This is because hardness is a property of a material that indicates its ability to resist deformation. Metal, particularly the type used in horseshoes, is known for its hardness and durability. It retains its shape even when force is applied, unlike a burlap sack or rubber gloves which are more flexible and easily deformable."
	Which sentence uses a simile?	['The baby fish in the aquarium are as tiny as specks.', 'The baby fish in the aquarium are tiny specks.']	0		closed choice	grade4	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"This sentence uses a simile:
The baby fish in the aquarium are as tiny as specks.
The words baby fish and specks are compared using the word as.
This sentence uses a metaphor:

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the relationship between the mass of particles, their kinetic energy, and the resultant temperature of the sample. Given that the particles in both samples have the same speed, the sample with particles of higher mass (Sample A) will have a higher average kinetic energy. The sample with higher average kinetic energy will have a higher temperature, hence, the answer is sample A."

Fawkes, a cockatiel from this group, has pale orange cheeks. Fawkes has two alleles for pale orange cheeks."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Fawkes's observable version of the cheek color trait is pale orange cheeks. So, Fawkes's phenotype for the cheek color trait is pale orange cheeks.	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The phenotype of an organism refers to the observable physical properties such as its appearance, development, etc. Here, Fawkes is described as having pale orange cheeks, which is his observable physical trait. Therefore, the phenotype for the cheek color trait of Fawkes is pale orange cheeks, making option 0 the correct choice."

	The donkeys move the carts at the same speed. Which cart is pulled with a larger force?	['a cart holding 63 pounds', 'a cart holding 76 pounds']	1	Two donkeys pull carts from the farmhouse to the yard. The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the cart that is heavier.
A cart holding 76 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 63 pounds. So, the cart holding 76 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other cart."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: If the carts are being moved at the same speed, the cart with a larger mass (in this case, weight) will require a larger force to achieve that speed. This is according to Newton's second law of motion which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. In this scenario, the cart holding 76 pounds is heavier than the cart holding 63 pounds, and thus requires a larger force to move at the same speed."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0Â° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each bird moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bird moved 35 miles in 10 hours.
The other bird moved 50 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each bird spent the same amount of time moving. The bird that moved 35 miles moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bird must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Speed is calculated by the distance traveled divided by time. In this case, both birds traveled for the same amount of time (10 hours). However, the first bird only covered a distance of 35 miles, while the second bird covered a distance of 50 miles. Hence, the first bird, which covered a shorter distance in the same amount of time, was moving at a lower speed."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The solution explains that the magnitude of the magnetic force is dependent on the distance between the magnets. In Pair 2, the magnets are closer together than in Pair 1, and therefore, the magnitude of the force is greater in Pair 2. Whether the magnets attract or repel does not affect the magnitude of the force, only its direction. Thus, the correct answer is choice 0 - ""The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2."""
	How long does it take to mow the lawn?	['33 minutes', '33 hours']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to mow the lawn is 33 minutes.
33 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: (0) 33 minutes
SOLUTION: The time it takes to mow a lawn can vary greatly depending on the size of the lawn and the type of mower used. However, 33 hours would be an extremely long time to mow a typical residential lawn, even if it was quite large and the person was using a push mower. Therefore, 33 minutes is a more reasonable estimate for this task."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.

['attract', 'repel']	1	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The question is about the interaction between two magnets. As stated in the hint, the south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. According to the basic principles of magnetism, like poles repel each other. Therefore, the magnets in question will repel each other, which corresponds to choice 1."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Both a copper statue turning green and a piece of avocado turning brown are examples of chemical changes. In these instances, the substances react with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter - copper oxide in the case of the statue, and a brown compound in the case of the avocado. Neither change is caused by heating or cooling, and they are not mere physical changes, because the original substances are transformed into something different.

All three bath towels have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 18Â°F towel is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. The higher the temperature, the greater the thermal energy. Therefore, the bath towel with the lowest temperature would have the least thermal energy. In this case, the 350-gram bath towel at a temperature of 18Â°F is the coldest and thus has the least thermal energy."

Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.

Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene.

So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Toby's genotype for the fur length gene is ff. Toby's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for long fur. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Toby's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Toby's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Toby's genotype is given as 'ff' which corresponds to the recessive allele for long fur.

On the other hand, there is no evidence in the text that suggests Anna's hummingbirds are photosynthetic. Therefore, the azalea plant is the photosynthetic organism."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
rust forming on a metal gate
burning a piece of wood"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Burning a piece of wood is a chemical change. When the wood burns, the type of matter in it changes. The wood turns black and gives off smoke.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But rust forming on a metal gate is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both rust forming on a metal gate and burning a piece of wood are chemical changes. In both cases, the original material is altered into a different form. The rusting process transforms the metal into rust, and burning transforms wood into ash and smoke. Thus, the correct choice is (1) Both are chemical changes."

He would prefer to watch a comedy. But he also wants to watch a movie with his sister. Steve's sister will only watch an action movie.	closed choice	grade4	social science	economics	Basic economic principles	Costs and benefits	"Before you decide to do something, it is often helpful to list costs and benefits.
Costs are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.
Benefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need."	"This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Steve wants or needs:
Steve will give up the chance to watch a movie with his sister."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The cost of Steve's decision to watch the comedy is that he misses out on the opportunity to watch a movie with his sister. This means he is giving up something he values or wants, which in this case is spending time with his sister. The cost of a decision is what you give up to get what you want. Therefore, option 0 is the correct answer."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. The paper changes into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	Food burning on a stove is a chemical change. The type of matter in the food changes. The food turns black and gives off smoke.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The process of burning food on a stove is a chemical change. This is because when food is burnt, new substances are formed such as char and smoke. The original properties of the food, such as its taste and nutritional content, are altered. These changes are irreversible, further confirming that it is a chemical change."

A football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long."	"The best estimate for the length of a hiking trail is 2 miles.
2 inches, 2 feet, and 2 yards are all too short."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: A hiking trail is typically measured in miles, not in inches, feet, or yards. This is because hiking trails are typically long paths that take a significant amount of time to traverse. An average hiking trail could be anywhere from a few miles to several miles long. Therefore, the best estimate for the length of a hiking trail from the given options is 2 miles."

The Chinese New Year celebration lasts for fifteen days.
It can be proved by looking up information about the Chinese New Year.
The second sentence states an opinion.
Fifteen days is a long time to celebrate a holiday.
Long time shows what a person believes, thinks, or feels. Another person might have a different opinion about what is a long time."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The sentence ""The Chinese New Year celebration lasts for fifteen days"" is a fact because it can be verified or proven to be true by looking up information about the duration of the Chinese New Year celebration. On the other hand, the sentence ""Fifteen days is a long time to celebrate a holiday"" is an opinion, as it reflects a personal view or belief about what constitutes a ""long time,"" and can vary from person to person."

['4 meters', '4 kilometers', '4 centimeters', '4 millimeters']	1	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance, mass, and volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a bus route across a small town is 4 kilometers.
4 millimeters, 4 centimeters, and 4 meters are all too short."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the length of a bus route across a small town is 4 kilometers. This is because 4 millimeters, 4 centimeters, and 4 meters are all too short to be the length of a bus route. Even in a small town, a bus route would need to be several kilometers long to cover the necessary distance. Therefore, the best choice is 4 kilometers."
	How long does it take to paint the walls in a bedroom?	['3 hours', '3 minutes']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to paint the walls in a bedroom is 3 hours.
3 minutes is too fast."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: Painting a bedroom typically takes several hours, including prep time, painting, and cleanup. The exact timing can vary depending on the size of the room, the number of coats needed, and the type of paint used. However, it is highly unlikely that the entire process could be completed in as little as 3 minutes. Therefore, 3 hours is a more realistic estimate."

Arms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly."	"Look at the picture of the harbor seal.
The harbor seal uses its flippers to push itself through water. The flippers can also help it change direction while swimming.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The humpback whale has flippers. Its limbs are adapted for swimming.
The ostrich has short wings and long, thin legs. Its limbs are not adapted for swimming. The ostrich uses its limbs to walk and run on land."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The humpback whale is the correct answer because, like the harbor seal, it has flippers that are adapted for swimming. The hint discusses the harbor seal's adaptation for swimming, and the text says that the humpback whale also has this adaptation. On the other hand, the ostrich uses its limbs to walk and run on land, indicating that its limbs are not adapted for swimming."

	The donkeys move the carts at the same speed. Which cart is pulled with a larger force?	['a cart holding 68 pounds', 'a cart holding 84 pounds']	1	Two donkeys pull carts from the farmhouse to the yard. The carts are the same. Each cart is holding different tools.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the cart that is heavier.
A cart holding 84 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 68 pounds. So, the cart holding 84 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other cart."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The force required to move an object is directly proportional to its mass. Therefore, the heavier the object, the greater the force required to move it. In this case, the cart holding 84 pounds is heavier than the one holding 68 pounds. Hence, the donkey pulling the 84-pound cart is exerting a larger force."
	Which is harder?	['nylon swim shorts', 'chalk']	1		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Materials	Compare properties of materials	"Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells."	"Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the chalk is harder. If you squeeze a piece of chalk, it will not change shape."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The hardness of a material depends on its ability to maintain its shape when force is applied. Chalk is a hard material because if you apply pressure to it, it will keep its shape unless an excessive amount of force is used. On the other hand, nylon swim shorts are made of a softer material which easily changes its shape when pressure is applied, making it less hard than chalk. Therefore, chalk is the harder material."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The task is to determine which sample of gas has a higher temperature based on the average kinetic energy of the gas particles. The particles in sample A have a higher average speed and a higher mass, which means they have a higher average kinetic energy. Since temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles, sample A has the higher temperature."

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 5 hours. The motorboat that moved 120 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: All three motorboats moved for the same amount of time, which is 5 hours. Therefore, to find out which motorboat was moving at the lowest speed, we just need to look at the distance each motorboat moved. The motorboat that moved 120 kilometers moved the shortest distance in 5 hours. Hence, that motorboat must have been moving at the lowest speed."

SOLUTION: The first text uses the term 'literally' correctly as it refers to an actual fact that the Rialto Bridge is hundreds of years old. This use is aligned with the traditional sense of the word, which means in a literal, factual, or exact manner. On the other hand, the second text exaggerates the age of the bridge, thus using 'literally' in a non-traditional, figurative sense. The bridge cannot be a million years old as human-made structures of that age do not exist."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: The answer is sample A because temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. From the solution, it is clear that particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy because they have more mass and a higher average speed than particles in sample B. Therefore, sample A has a higher temperature than sample B."

	Which statement describes the motorcycle's motion?	['The motorcycle has a constant velocity.', 'The motorcycle is accelerating.']	1	A motorcycle is swerving to the right to avoid a pothole.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Identify whether objects are accelerating	"An object's velocity describes its speed and its direction.
An object has a constant velocity when neither its speed nor its direction is changing. So, an object has a constant velocity when the object is:
moving in a straight line at a constant speed, or
remaining motionless.
If an object does not have a constant velocity, the object is accelerating. An object is accelerating when either its speed or its direction is changing. So, an object is accelerating when the object is:
speeding up,
slowing down, or
changing direction."	The motorcycle is changing direction. So, the motorcycle is accelerating.	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The motorcycle was swerving to avoid a pothole, which involves a change in direction. According to the laws of motion, any change in velocity (which includes speed and direction) is considered acceleration. Therefore, the motorcycle is not moving at a constant velocity, but is instead accelerating."

The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 2
SOLUTION: The solution explains that the direction of the magnetic force (attracting or repelling) does not affect the magnitude of the force. Since the magnets in both pairs are of the same size and distance apart, the magnitude of the magnetic force in both pairs is the same. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 2 - The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."
	Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the thorns trait?	['having thorns', 'not having thorns']	1	"In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype rr for the thorns gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color geneâ€”one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The rose plant's genotype for the thorns gene is rr. The rose plant's genotype of rr has only r alleles. The r allele is for not having thorns. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be not having thorns.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of rr has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be not having thorns."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The rose plant's genotype for the thorns gene is rr which is the recessive allele for not having thorns. Since the plant has only recessive alleles for this trait, its phenotype will express the characteristic associated with the recessive allele. Therefore, the plant's phenotype for the thorns trait is not having thorns."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram."	"The better estimate for the mass of an elephant is 6,730 kilograms.
6,730 grams is too light."	"ANSWER: 0

There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.

48 ounces and 48 pounds are both too light."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The best estimate for the mass of a passenger airplane is 48 tons. An airplane is a large and heavy piece of machinery, designed to carry many passengers and luggage, therefore it cannot be 48 ounces or 48 pounds as these measurements are far too light. A ton, on the other hand, is a large unit of weight and 48 tons give a reasonable estimate of an airplane's mass."

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

As the log breaks down, the type of matter in it changes. Over time, the log becomes softer and has a different smell."	"ANSWER: 0
SOLUTION: A log decomposing in the woods is a chemical change because decomposition involves breaking down the substances at a molecular level, which is a characteristic of a chemical change. A chemical change is a process where one or more substances are altered into one or more new and different substances. In this case, the log gradually breaks down into simpler substances due to the action of microorganisms, fungi, insects, weather, etc. Hence, the answer is chemical change."

The volume of Mars is more than ten times as large as Mercury's."	['false', 'true']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 Â· 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 Â· 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Mars. The volume of Mars is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3, which is less than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Mars is less than ten times as large as Mercury's."	"ANSWER: (0) false
SOLUTION: The volume of Mars is 1.63 x 10^11 km^3, while ten times the volume of Mercury is 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. Therefore, the volume of Mars is not more than ten times larger than the volume of Mercury. This makes the original statement false."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
a puddle freezing into ice on a cold night
cutting an orange"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it reÂ­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.
Cutting an orange is a physical change. The orange gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut orange.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
A puddle freezing is caused by cooling. But cutting an orange is not."	"ANSWER: (2) 
SOLUTION: Both a puddle freezing into ice on a cold night and cutting an orange are physical changes. Physical changes involve alterations to the physical properties of a substance without any change to its molecular composition. In these instances, the water in the puddle and the orange retain their original properties, just their forms change, hence the answer is (2) Both are only physical changes."

['Lepus timidus', 'Lepus arcticus']	1	The Arctic hare lives in very cold parts of Canada and Greenland. Its thick fur helps it live in the cold. The Arctic hare's scientific name refers to the environment it lives in.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Origins of scientific names	"When a scientist identifies a new organism, he or she chooses its scientific name.
Sometimes, an organism is named after the place where it was first found. Other times, an organism is named after the scientist who first identified it. Or, the scientific name might describe the organism's physical traits.
Many of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek. Sometimes, English words are changed to make them sound more like Latin or Greek. The new words are then used in an organism's scientific name."	"This organism's scientific name refers to the Arctic, the environment it lives in.
The word arcticus refers to the Arctic. So, the Arctic hare's scientific name is Lepus arcticus."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: The hint given in the problem statement refers to the Arctic hare's habitat, which is the Arctic region. Considering this, the scientific name of the Arctic hare is more likely to include the term 'arcticus', which refers to the Arctic. Therefore, the correct choice is 'Lepus arcticus'."

Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But a sandwich rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1
SOLUTION: Both cooking a pancake and a sandwich rotting are examples of chemical changes. In the process of cooking, the pancake batter undergoes a chemical reaction due to heat, turning it into a cooked pancake. Similarly, a sandwich rotting is also a chemical change, where the organic matter in the sandwich breaks down over time. Hence, both these changes involve a transformation of substances into new substances, indicating they are chemical changes."

Wendy is a competitive horseback rider, and she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games, which are held every four years."	['simple', 'compound', 'complex', 'compound-complex']	3		closed choice	grade10	language science	grammar	Phrases and clauses	Is the sentence simple, compound, complex, or compound-complex?	"A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause (or subordinate clause) is not a complete thought and cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw the flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard a rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause in a complex sentence usually begins with a subordinating conjunction or relative pronoun. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, or whose.

Wendy is a competitive horseback rider, and she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games, which are held every four years."	"ANSWER: 3
SOLUTION: The sentence given is a compound-complex sentence. This is because it is composed of two independent clauses: ""Wendy is a competitive horseback rider"" and ""she will be competing in the next World Equestrian Games"", which can stand alone as sentences. Additionally, it contains a dependent clause, ""which are held every four years,"" that cannot stand alone as a complete thought. Thus, the sentence combines the features of both compound and complex sentences, making it a compound-complex sentence."
