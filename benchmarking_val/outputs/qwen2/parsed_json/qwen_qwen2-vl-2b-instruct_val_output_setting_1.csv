The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.

Covering its eggs with its body increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: [""the leech's eggs will hatch"", 'the leech will not eat for up to a week', 'the leech will fight a water snail']
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After  reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream. The leech then flattens its body over its eggs to protect them. The leech protects its eggs until they hatch, which takes four to seven days. During this time, the leech does not leave the eggs or eat.
Water snails are predators that eat leech eggs. The snails easily eat eggs that are not covered by an adult leech. But snails cannot easily get to eggs that are covered by a leech.

1529	1529	"Question: Based on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: [""It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age."", 'It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles.', ""It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure."", 'It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.']
 Hint: Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['FliG protein . . . FliG gene', 'FliG gene . . . FliG protein']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Certain types of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria have long, thin structures called flagella. The flagella on these bacteria can spin. This motion propels the bacteria and allows them to move through their environments.
Flagella are assembled from many different proteins that stick to each other. Parts of the E. coli flagella are made up of a protein called FliG. The FliG protein is encoded by the FliG gene.
Scientists discovered some E. coli cells that had no flagella. These bacteria had a mutation in the FliG gene. Compared to the FliG gene without a mutation, the mutated FliG gene encoded a form of the FliG protein with a different structure.
This different form of the FliG protein could not stick to other flagella proteins.

Epiphytic orchids are flowering plants that can grow in tropical forests. An orchid can grow on tree branches in the canopy, or upper layer of the forest.
In the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight than it would in the shadowy lower parts of the forest. The additional sunlight allows the orchid to perform more photosynthesis. There is also more wind in the canopy, which helps the orchid spread its seeds to other branches.
The orchid does not damage the tree it grows on, but it also does not provide resources to the tree.

 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Common carp are a type of fish that have scales on their bodies. The pattern of scales on a common carp is established while the fish is developing inside its egg. During this time, a protein called Fgfr1a1 sends signals to the fish's body that direct the shape and spacing of the fish's scales. The signals from the Fgfr1a1 protein result in common carp with small, evenly spaced scales.
The Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene.
A certain carp had large, patchy scales because of a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene. Compared to the fgfr1a1 gene without a mutation, the mutated fgfr1a1 gene encoded a form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure.

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Acacia ants spend most of their lives on bullhorn acacia trees. Up to 30,000 ants can live together in a colony on one acacia tree!
The ants eat nectar produced by the tree and build nests inside hollowed-out thorns on the tree's branches. The ants also attack insects and other animals that try to eat the tree's leaves. Sometimes the ants leave the tree and destroy nearby plants. This creates open space around the tree. The open space makes it easier for the acacia tree to get resources such as sunlight and water.

 Choices: ['CmACO1 gene . . . CmACO1 protein', 'CmACO1 protein . . . CmACO1 gene']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

In plants such as the European cantaloupe, fruit ripening is affected by a substance called ethylene (ETH-uh-leen). Ethylene is made inside a plant's cells with the help of a protein called CmACO1. The CmACO1 protein is encoded by the CmACO1 gene.
A certain European cantaloupe plant had a mutation in its CmACO1 gene. Compared to the CmACO1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CmACO1 gene encoded a form of the CmACO1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the CmACO1 protein could make only a small amount of ethylene. The fruits of this plant took longer to ripen than fruits from plants containing more ethylene. Farmers found this mutation useful because the fruit stayed good for a longer period of time after harvest.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in', ""the male's offspring will become adults"", 'the male will spend more energy while waving his fins']
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time. This behavior is called fanning.
By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch.
