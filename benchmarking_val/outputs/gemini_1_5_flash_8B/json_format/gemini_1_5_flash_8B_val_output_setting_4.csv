5	5	"Question: Based on this information, what is Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.
 Solution: Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Daffodil's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Daffodil's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 4:0 (3) 3:1 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black eyes. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red eyes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) compare-contrast (1) problem-solution
 Hint: Read the text.
In the 1970s, architect I. M. Pei took on the difficult assignment of renovating and updating the beautiful Louvre Palace in Paris without overpowering the original building. The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances. It also needed more restrooms and a bigger cafeteria. Pei designed a large central underground entrance and visitor center. He then added a glass pyramid above the entryway. Although Pei's design faced initial criticism, today the pyramid is considered a brilliant success—a landmark that complements the old palace without interfering with it.
 Solution: The text uses a problem-solution structure to show how architect I.M. Pei modernized the Louvre with an entrance that complemented the existing building. In the text, certain words and phrases help to organize ideas in a problem-solution structure. Notice the phrases difficult assignment and brilliant success.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) short fur (1) long fur
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Chanel is a cat from this group. Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene.
 Solution: Chanel's genotype for the fur length gene is FF. Chanel's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for short fur. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chanel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chanel's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.

65	65	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 3:1 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two summer squash plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with fuzzy leaves or smooth leaves, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for fuzzy leaves, is dominant over the l allele, which is for smooth leaves.
Fuzzy leaves is the dominant allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the dominant version of the leaf texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy leaves must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
Smooth leaves is the recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the recessive version of the leaf texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with smooth leaves must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with fuzzy leaves for every 2 offspring with smooth leaves.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.

The Miranda warning, the reading of rights given to a suspect by police prior to questioning, is not unique to the United States; a number of other countries have equivalent rights, including Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, and Kazakhstan.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Miranda v. Arizona was one of a few Supreme Court cases to have implications for law enforcement, so it was not one of a kind in that respect. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.

 Solution: Kumal's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Kumal's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Kumal's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Kumal's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I).
Mer is a guppy from this group. Mer has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Mer's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Mer's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Mer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Toriel is a horse from this group. Toriel has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Toriel's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Toriel's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Toriel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Toriel's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) copepod (1) rotifer (2) green algae
 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a secondary consumer, so the copepod is a tertiary consumer.
The rotifer has arrows pointing to it from the green algae and the water flea. Neither the green algae nor the water flea is a secondary consumer, so the rotifer is not a tertiary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the rotifer and the shiner. The rotifer and the shiner are secondary consumers, so the black crappie is a tertiary consumer.

273	273	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree.
 Solution: When a megabat eats a fig, the megabat gets the food it needs to survive and grow. So the megabat benefits from its relationship with the fig tree.
Both the fig tree and its seeds have a better chance of surviving when the bat moves the seeds to a new location. So, the fig tree also benefits from its relationship with the megabat.
Since both the megabat and the fig tree benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

283	283	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 3:1 (2) 0:4 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of Channel catfish, some individuals have a brown body and others have a white body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white body (b) is recessive to the allele for a brown body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two Channel catfish.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a white body or a brown body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a white body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a brown body.
A white body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a white body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A brown body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a brown body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a white body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a brown body.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""0"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two Channel catfish, both having the genotype Bb.  The possible genotypes of the offspring are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb.

Offspring with a brown body can have the genotypes BB or Bb. There are 4 boxes with genotypes BB or Bb. Thus, the ratio of white to brown body offspring is 0:4, meaning no white-bodied offspring are expected from this cross.""

 Solution: Look at the picture of the Eurasian lynx.
The Eurasian lynx has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The Eurasian lynx uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The marmot has large front teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The marmot uses its mouth to gnaw on plant matter.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 3:1 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele for white wool (L) is dominant over the allele for black wool (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black wool or white wool, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for white wool, is dominant over the l allele, which is for black wool.
Black wool is the recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the wool color trait must have only recessive alleles for the wool color gene. So, offspring with black wool must have the genotype ll.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ll.
White wool is the dominant allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the wool color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wool color gene. So, offspring with white wool must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black wool. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with white wool.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Little Rock Lake, a freshwater lake ecosystem in Wisconsin.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The black crappie has three arrows pointing to it. These arrows start from the rotifer, the water flea, and the shiner, which are all consumers. So, the black crappie is a consumer but not an omnivore.
The rotifer has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae, which is a producer. The rotifer also has an arrow pointing to it from the water flea, which is a consumer. The rotifer eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the golden algae, which is a producer. The copepod also has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer, which is a consumer. The copepod eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy fleece (1) a woolly fleece
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
Sage is a sheep from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype FF for the fleece type gene.
 Solution: Sage's genotype for the fleece type gene is FF. Sage's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for a hairy fleece. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Sage's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) tokay gecko (1) Siberian tiger
 Hint: Snow leopards live in the snowy mountains of central Asia. The 's feet are adapted for walking on snow and ice.
Figure: snow leopard.
 Solution: Look at the picture of the snow leopard.
The snow leopard has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice. The fur can help keep the snow leopard's feet warm. The large pads help spread its weight over a larger area. This allows it to walk on ice without slipping and to walk on snow without sinking in too deep.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Siberian tiger has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice.
The tokay gecko has wide, sticky toes. Its feet are not adapted to walk on snow and ice. The tokay gecko uses its feet to climb trees and walk on leaves.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the leech's eggs will hatch (1) the leech will not eat for up to a week (2) the leech will fight a water snail
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After  reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream. The leech then flattens its body over its eggs to protect them. The leech protects its eggs until they hatch, which takes four to seven days. During this time, the leech does not leave the eggs or eat.
Water snails are predators that eat leech eggs. The snails easily eat eggs that are not covered by an adult leech. But snails cannot easily get to eggs that are covered by a leech.
Figure: a snail leech.
 Solution: Look for the part of the passage that describes the effect of covering its eggs with its body. Use this information to determine why this behavior can increase the reproductive success of the snail leech.
Choice ""The snail leech is a type of worm that often lives in freshwater streams. After a snail leech reproduces, it attaches its eggs to a rock at the bottom of the stream.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a reddish-brown coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Astro is a horse from this group. Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Astro's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Astro's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 3:1 (2) 4:0 (3) 1:3 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the H allele, which is for not having horns, is dominant over the h allele, which is for having horns.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to offspring that have horns is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have horns. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have horns.

585	585	"Question: Based on this information, what is Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having horns (1) having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene.
 Solution: Cheyenne's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Cheyenne's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.

Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Ice crystals forming on a window is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air can change directly into ice when it touches a very cold window! A change of state from a gas to a solid is called depositing.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But ice crystals forming on a window is not.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Lady is a horse from this group. Lady has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Lady's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Lady's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Bernard noticed that he could make a dome of water on a penny if he added drops of water slowly enough. He wondered if adding soap to the water would allow him to fit more or less water on the penny.
Bernard put equal-sized drops of pure water, one at a time, onto a penny. He recorded the number of drops he could add before the water spilled over the edge of the penny.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

648	648	"Question: Based on this information, what is Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) pale orange cheeks (1) bright orange cheeks
 Hint: In a group of cockatiels, some individuals have bright orange cheeks and others have pale orange cheeks. In this group, the gene for the cheek color trait has two alleles. The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r).
Jack is a cockatiel from this group. Jack has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the cheek color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Jack's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Jack's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks.

 Hint: This passage describes a chemical reaction. Read the passage. Then, follow the instructions below.
Like people on Earth, astronauts living on the International Space Station need oxygen to survive. Since there is no oxygen in space for the astronauts to breathe, they make oxygen using a process called electrolysis. This process uses electricity to break down water into hydrogen gas and oxygen gas. The hydrogen gas can be removed from the space station or recycled, and the oxygen gas is released into the air that the astronauts breathe.
 Solution: Read the underlined text carefully. Look for information about what happens to water in this chemical reaction.

716	716	"Question: Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the eye color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) red eyes (1) brown eyes
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have red eyes and others have brown eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the eye color gene.
 Solution: You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the eye color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 3:1 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the Huntington's disease trait in humans:
Huntington's disease is a condition that causes the death of brain cells over time. This loss of cells interferes with brain function and may lead to uncontrolled movements, difficulty thinking, and changes in behavior.
In a group of humans, some individuals have Huntington's disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Huntington's disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive to the allele for having Huntington's disease (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two humans.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have Huntington's disease, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for not having Huntington's disease, is recessive to the H allele, which is for having Huntington's disease.
Not having Huntington's disease is the recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the recessive version of the Huntington's disease trait must have only recessive alleles for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that do not have Huntington's disease must have the genotype hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
Having Huntington's disease is the dominant allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the dominant version of the Huntington's disease trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that have Huntington's disease must have the genotype HH or Hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype HH or Hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring that do not have Huntington's disease for every 2 offspring that have Huntington's disease.

The bear sedge does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the bear sedge.
The only arrow pointing to the barren-ground caribou starts from the lichen. The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the barren-ground caribou.
The lichen does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bilberry to the lichen.There are four paths matter can take from the bilberry to the earthworm: bilberry->Arctic fox->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->Arctic fox->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->snowy owl->earthworm. bilberry->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk->earthworm. There is one path matter can take from the bilberry to the rough-legged hawk: bilberry->brown lemming->parasitic jaeger->rough-legged hawk.

777	777	"Question: Based on this information, what is Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a reddish-brown coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Dasher is a horse from this group. Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Dasher's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Dasher's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dasher's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Dasher's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the bottles with lids kept on (1) the bottles with lids taken off
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Steve wanted to freeze soda to make popsicles. He knew that soda contains carbon dioxide gas, which forms bubbles as it escapes from the liquid. He wondered if the popsicles would freeze more quickly if he removed the carbon dioxide.
Steve took the lids off three small bottles of soda. He left the lids off overnight so that carbon dioxide could escape from the bottles. He kept the lids on three other bottles to keep the carbon dioxide in. The next morning, Steve placed all six bottles in the freezer. After two hours, he checked whether soda in any of the bottles had frozen.
Figure: soda with carbon dioxide bubbles.
 Solution: In this experiment, Steve investigated whether removing carbon dioxide from soda affects how quickly the soda freezes. So, the bottles with lids taken off were part of an experimental group.
Carbon dioxide was not removed from the bottles with lids kept on. So, they were not part of an experimental group.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Arctic fox (1) bilberry
 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The bilberry does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the bilberry is a producer, not an omnivore.
The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry, which is a producer. The Arctic fox also has an arrow pointing to it from the collared lemming, which is a consumer. The Arctic fox eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.

840	840	"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) fuzzy fruit (1) smooth fruit
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
A certain tomato plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene.
 Solution: The tomato plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is ff. The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for fuzzy fruit. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the tomato plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit.

 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Kraken is a guppy from this group. Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene.

The Japan Trench formed at a () boundary.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) divergent (1) convergent (2) transform
 Hint: Read the passage and look at the picture.
The Japan Trench is a deep-sea trench east of the islands of Japan. The trench formed as the Pacific Plate subducted, or sank, below the Okhotsk Plate. The two plates continue to move toward each other. This movement can cause devastating earthquakes in Japan, such as a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011.
 Solution: To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Japan Trench, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having agouti fur (1) having agouti fur
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A).
Salem is a cat from this group. Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene.
 Solution: Salem's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa. Salem's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for not having agouti fur. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Salem's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Salem's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 1:3 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have thorns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. The question tells you that the R allele, which is for having thorns, is dominant over the r allele, which is for not having thorns.
Having thorns is the dominant allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the thorns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the thorns gene. So, offspring that have thorns must have the genotype RR or Rr.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr.
Not having thorns is the recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the thorns trait must have only recessive alleles for the thorns gene. So, offspring that do not have thorns must have the genotype rr.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype rr.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have thorns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have thorns.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""2"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two plants that are both homozygous recessive (rr) for the trait of not having thorns.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a black body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a black body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a gray body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a black body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A black body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a black body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a black body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a gray body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a black body.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygous gray-bodied fruit flies (Bb).  Analyzing the genotypes of the offspring, all four possible outcomes are Bb.

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the G allele, which is for climbing growth, is dominant over the g allele, which is for bush growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white spots (1) solid coloring
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Ace is a cow from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.

 Task: closed choice

 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a dwarf body or a normal-sized body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a dwarf body.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to offspring with a normal-sized body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a dwarf body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a normal-sized body.

1069	1069	"Question: Based on this information, what is Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) wavy fur (1) straight fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Nutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.
 Solution: Nutmeg's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nutmeg's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.

Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a chemical change. When the flashlight is turned on, the chemicals in the battery react with each other to form new chemicals. This creates electricity, which powers the lightbulb.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) tortoise (1) whale shark (2) African bullfrog (3) emerald tree boa
 Hint: Fish live underwater. They have fins, not limbs.
Fish are cold-blooded. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals depends on their environment.
A piranha is an example of a fish.
 Solution: An emerald tree boa is a reptile. It has scaly, waterproof skin.
Tree boas eat small mammals, birds, lizards, and frogs. Tree boas only need to eat once every few months!
A tortoise is a reptile. It has scaly, waterproof skin.
A tortoise's shell protects it from predators. When a tortoise feels threatened, it can pull its head and legs inside its shell.
An African bullfrog is an amphibian. It has moist skin and begins its life in water.
Frogs live near water or in damp places. Most frogs lay their eggs in water.
A whale shark is a fish. It lives underwater. It has fins, not limbs.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are only physical changes. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Making paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) plainfin midshipman (1) sea urchin (2) phytoplankton (3) kelp
 Hint: Below is a food web from an ocean ecosystem in Monterey Bay, off the coast of California.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not an omnivore.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. The plainfin midshipman also has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. The plainfin midshipman eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton, the plainfin midshipman, and the black rockfish, which are consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.
The sea urchin has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the kelp, which is a producer. So, the sea urchin is a consumer but not an omnivore.

Sulfur dioxide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a compound (1) an elementary substance
 Hint: The model below represents a molecule of sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is a poisonous gas that is released into the atmosphere when volcanoes erupt.
 Solution: Use the model to determine whether sulfur dioxide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.

Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 2:2 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have bumpy fruit and others have smooth fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cucumber plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with bumpy fruit or smooth fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for bumpy fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for smooth fruit.
Bumpy fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with bumpy fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
Smooth fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to offspring with smooth fruit is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with bumpy fruit. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with smooth fruit.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) smooth leaves (1) fuzzy leaves
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype LL for the leaf texture gene.
 Solution: The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is LL. The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for fuzzy leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves.

A certain rose plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Rr for the thorns gene.
 Solution: You need to determine the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the thorns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be having thorns.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are only physical changes. (2) Both are caused by heating. (3) Both are caused by cooling.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 0:4 (2) 3:1 (3) 1:3 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight fur or curly fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for curly fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for straight fur.
Straight fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the dominant version of the fur type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur type gene. So, offspring with straight fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Curly fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the recessive version of the fur type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur type gene. So, offspring with curly fur must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with straight fur to offspring with curly fur is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with straight fur. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with curly fur.

 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.
 Solution: The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

1513	1513	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 0:4 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two budgerigar parakeets.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with blue body feathers or green body feathers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for green body feathers, is dominant over the b allele, which is for blue body feathers.
Blue body feathers is the recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the recessive version of the body feather color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with blue body feathers must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
Green body feathers is the dominant allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the dominant version of the body feather color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with green body feathers must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with blue body feathers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green body feathers.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""1"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygous parents (Bb).  The possible genotypes of the offspring are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb.  Since B (green) is dominant, the genotypes BB and Bb will result in green feathers. The genotype bb results in blue feathers.  There are 0 offspring with blue feathers and 4 offspring with green feathers. Therefore the ratio is 0:4, which simplifies to 0:1, and the closest choice among the options is 0:4.""

1529	1529	"Question: Based on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age. (1) It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles. (2) It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure. (3) It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.
 Hint: Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.
 Solution: Think about these details from the text:
Fossils can show how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Fossil evidence shows that beetles die out less often than any other animal.
Beetles' low extinction rate helps explain the large number of beetle species.
In order to show that beetles die out less often than other animals, scientists must have compared different animals' extinction rates. To do this, they would need to figure out how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Based on these clues, you can guess that fossil evidence let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct animals. This helped them figure out that beetles die out less often than other animals, which explains the huge number of beetle species.

 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Certain types of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria have long, thin structures called flagella. The flagella on these bacteria can spin. This motion propels the bacteria and allows them to move through their environments.
Flagella are assembled from many different proteins that stick to each other. Parts of the E. coli flagella are made up of a protein called FliG. The FliG protein is encoded by the FliG gene.
Scientists discovered some E. coli cells that had no flagella. These bacteria had a mutation in the FliG gene. Compared to the FliG gene without a mutation, the mutated FliG gene encoded a form of the FliG protein with a different structure.
This different form of the FliG protein could not stick to other flagella proteins.

 Hint: Fish live underwater. They have fins, not limbs.
Fish are cold-blooded. The body temperature of cold-blooded animals depends on their environment.
A great white shark is an example of a fish.
 Solution: A green chameleon is a reptile. It has scaly, waterproof skin.
Chameleons eat insects. They use their long, sticky tongues to catch their prey.
A porcupinefish is a fish. It lives underwater. It has fins, not limbs.
Porcupinefish can puff up their bodies with air or water to scare off predators.
A European green toad is an amphibian. It has moist skin and begins its life in water.
Toads do not have teeth! They swallow their food whole.
A zebra is a mammal. It has hair and feeds its young milk.
Zebras eat mostly grass. But they sometimes eat other types of plants, such as shrubs or tree bark.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) solid coloring (1) white spots
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Winnee is a cow from this group. Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene.
 Solution: Winnee's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Winnee's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for white spots. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.
To check this answer, consider whether Winnee's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Winnee's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a gray body (1) a black body
 Hint: In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a black body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the homozygous genotype BB for the body color gene.
 Solution: The fruit fly's genotype for the body color gene is BB. The fruit fly's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a gray body. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body.
To check this answer, consider whether the fruit fly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The swallowtail caterpillar has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree. The persimmon tree is not a primary consumer, so the swallowtail caterpillar is not a secondary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a primary consumer, so the beaver is not a secondary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a secondary consumer.
The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver. The swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver are primary consumers, so the black bear is a secondary consumer.

When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

 Hint: Below is a food web from Shenandoah National Park, a forest ecosystem in Virginia.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.

1841	1841	"Question: Based on this information, what is Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having horns (1) not having horns
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Zelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Zelda's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Zelda's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.

Melted rock below the earth's surface is called magma. Granodiorite forms from magma that contains a lot of silica. As the magma cools, minerals such as feldspar begin to form. When the magma becomes solid, it turns into granodiorite.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the pots with pure water (1) the pots with salted water
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Hansen was a chef's assistant in an Italian restaurant. One of his coworkers told him that adding salt to water would cause the spaghetti to cook faster.
Hansen gathered six pots that were the same size. He filled each pot with the same amount of pure water. He added one tablespoon of salt to each of three pots. He did not add salt to the other three pots. Then, Hansen boiled spaghetti in each pot. He checked how firm the spaghetti was after five minutes of boiling.

1958	1958	"Question: Based on this information, what is Nico's genotype for the body hair gene?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) Bb
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Nico, a cat from this group, has a hairy body. Nico has one allele for a hairy body and one allele for a hairless body.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Nico has one allele for a hairy body (B) and one allele for a hairless body (b). So, Nico's genotype for the body hair gene is Bb.

a copper statue turning green
a piece of avocado turning brown
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by cooling. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
A piece of avocado turning brown is a chemical change. The avocado reacts with oxygen in the air to form a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown part of the avocado, the inside will still be green. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change hasn't happened to that part of the avocado.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) short fur (1) long fur
 Hint: In a group of dogs, some individuals have short fur and others have long fur. In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F).
Toby is a dog from this group. Toby has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur length gene.
 Solution: Toby's genotype for the fur length gene is ff. Toby's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for long fur. So, Toby's phenotype for the fur length trait must be long fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Toby's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for long fur (f) is recessive to the allele for short fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having thorns (1) not having thorns
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have thorns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype rr for the thorns gene.
 Solution: The rose plant's genotype for the thorns gene is rr. The rose plant's genotype of rr has only r alleles. The r allele is for not having thorns. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be not having thorns.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having thorns (r) is recessive to the allele for having thorns (R). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of rr has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be not having thorns.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Hera is a cow from this group. Hera has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene.
 Solution: Hera's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Hera's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Hera's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Hera's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Hera's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.

2149	2149	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with sour fruit to offspring with sweet fruit? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 2:2 (4) 1:3
 Hint: In a group of muskmelon plants, some individuals have sour fruit and others have sweet fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit taste trait has two alleles. The allele for sour fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for sweet fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two muskmelon plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with sour fruit or sweet fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for sour fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for sweet fruit.
Sour fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the dominant version of the fruit taste trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sour fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Sweet fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit taste trait. A muskmelon plant with the recessive version of the fruit taste trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit taste gene. So, offspring with sweet fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with sour fruit to offspring with sweet fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with sour fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with sweet fruit.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": 1,
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two plants that are both heterozygous for the sour fruit trait (Ff).  There are four possible genotypes of offspring: FF, Ff, Ff, and ff.  Of these, FF and Ff both result in sour fruit, while ff results in sweet fruit.  There are four boxes with either FF or Ff and zero boxes with ff. Thus, the ratio of sour fruit to sweet fruit offspring is 4:0.""

 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) a hairless body
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).
Coco is a cat from this group. Coco has the heterozygous genotype Bb for the body hair gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait. First, consider the alleles in Coco's genotype for the body hair gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Coco's genotype of Bb has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Coco's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairy body.

 Hint: N/A
 Solution: Step 1: Think about each change.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Baking a loaf of bread is a chemical change. The type of matter in the dough changes when it is baked. The dough turns into bread!
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.

2342	2342	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when an epiphytic orchid grows on a tree branch in the canopy?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Epiphytic orchids are flowering plants that can grow in tropical forests. An orchid can grow on tree branches in the canopy, or upper layer of the forest.
In the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight than it would in the shadowy lower parts of the forest. The additional sunlight allows the orchid to perform more photosynthesis. There is also more wind in the canopy, which helps the orchid spread its seeds to other branches.
The orchid does not damage the tree it grows on, but it also does not provide resources to the tree.
Figure: epiphytic orchids growing on trees in a tropical forest.
 Solution: When an epiphytic orchid grows on a tree branch in the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight and wind than it would if it grew on the forest floor. So, the orchid benefits from its relationship with the tree.
The tree is not damaged by the orchid, but the tree is not helped, either. So, the tree is not significantly affected by its relationship with the orchid.
Since the orchid benefits and the tree is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when an epiphytic orchid grows on a tree branch in the canopy.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json

  ""answer"": 2,

2359	2359	"Question: What type of rock is dolostone?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) metamorphic (1) sedimentary (2) igneous
 Hint: Dolostone is a rock that forms from ocean sediment. Dolostone is made mostly of the mineral dolomite. This piece of dolostone also contains yellow grains of the mineral sulphur.
Ocean sediment can contain the shells of marine organisms. As many layers of ocean sediment build up, the shells can go through a chemical reaction that forms new minerals, such as dolomite. Dolostone forms when these chemically changed sediments are pressed together to form rock.
 Solution: Dolostone is a sedimentary rock. Like other sedimentary rocks, it forms from layers of sediment.
Ocean sediment builds up in layers. Over time, the sediment can go through a chemical reaction with the water around it. As many layers of the sediment build up, the top layers press down on the bottom layers. Dolostone forms when the bottom layers of the chemically changed sediment are pressed together to form rock.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) air inside a bubble (1) clothespin (2) beans (3) lemonade
 Hint: N/A
 Solution: A clothespin is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. You can open or close a clothespin. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.
A bean is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. If you put many beans into a jar, the group of beans will take the shape of the jar, as a liquid would. But be careful! A bean is not a liquid. Each bean still has a size and shape of its own.
The air inside a bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air inside a bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.
Lemonade is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour lemonade into a cup, the lemonade will take the shape of the cup. But the lemonade will still take up the same amount of space.

 Hint: This is a piece of andesite. It was collected near a volcano in Greece.
Andesite is commonly found near volcanoes that are close to oceans. It forms through the cooling of melted rock. The mineral grains in andesite are usually small in size.
 Solution: Andesite is an igneous rock. Like other igneous rocks, it forms when melted rock cools and hardens.
Melted rock at the earth's surface is called lava. Andesite forms from lava that contains large amounts of iron, magnesium, and silica. As the lava cools, minerals such as feldspar and pyroxene begin to form. When the lava becomes solid, it turns into andesite.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mutualistic (1) parasitic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Pseudoscorpions are small arachnids that often crawl onto the backs of large beetles, such as harlequin beetles.
When a beetle with a pseudoscorpion on its back flies away, the pseudoscorpion rides along. This ride helps the pseudoscorpion disperse, or move to a new location, much faster and farther than it could on its own.
When the pseudoscorpion is carried along, it does not harm the beetle, but it does not help the beetle, either.
Figure: a pseudoscorpion on the back of a harlequin beetle.
 Solution: When a pseudoscorpion is dispersed by a harlequin beetle, the pseudoscorpion is able to move faster and farther than it could on its own. So, the pseudoscorpion benefits from its relationship with the beetle.
The beetle is not harmed by the pseudoscorpion, but the beetle is not helped, either. So, the beetle is not significantly affected by its relationship with the pseudoscorpion.
Since the pseudoscorpion benefits and the beetle is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when a pseudoscorpion is dispersed by a harlequin beetle.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Fgfr1a1 protein . . . fgfr1a1 gene (1) fgfr1a1 gene . . . Fgfr1a1 protein
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Common carp are a type of fish that have scales on their bodies. The pattern of scales on a common carp is established while the fish is developing inside its egg. During this time, a protein called Fgfr1a1 sends signals to the fish's body that direct the shape and spacing of the fish's scales. The signals from the Fgfr1a1 protein result in common carp with small, evenly spaced scales.
The Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene.
A certain carp had large, patchy scales because of a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene. Compared to the fgfr1a1 gene without a mutation, the mutated fgfr1a1 gene encoded a form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the Fgfr1a1 protein could not send signals to the fish's body.
Figure: common carp with large, patchy scales (top), and small, evenly spaced scales.
 Solution: A mutation in a gene may affect the protein it encodes.
So, the mutation in the fgfr1 a1 gene affected the structure and function of the Fgfr1 a1 protein.

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Acacia ants spend most of their lives on bullhorn acacia trees. Up to 30,000 ants can live together in a colony on one acacia tree!
The ants eat nectar produced by the tree and build nests inside hollowed-out thorns on the tree's branches. The ants also attack insects and other animals that try to eat the tree's leaves. Sometimes the ants leave the tree and destroy nearby plants. This creates open space around the tree. The open space makes it easier for the acacia tree to get resources such as sunlight and water.
Figure: acacia ants feeding on nectar of a bullhorn acacia tree.
 Solution: When acacia ants live on a bullhorn acacia tree, the ants get food and shelter. So, the ants benefit from their relationship with the bullhorn acacia tree.
The ants protect the tree and make it easier for the tree to get resources. So, the bullhorn acacia tree also benefits from its relationship with the ants.

2566	2566	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with dark yellow flowers to offspring with light yellow flowers? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of rose plants, some individuals have light yellow flowers and others have dark yellow flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for light yellow flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for dark yellow flowers (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dark yellow flowers or light yellow flowers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for light yellow flowers, is dominant over the f allele, which is for dark yellow flowers.
Dark yellow flowers is the recessive allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the flower color trait must have only recessive alleles for the flower color gene. So, offspring with dark yellow flowers must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
Light yellow flowers is the dominant allele's version of the flower color trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the flower color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the flower color gene. So, offspring with light yellow flowers must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dark yellow flowers to offspring with light yellow flowers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dark yellow flowers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with light yellow flowers.

  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two plants that are heterozygous for the flower color trait (Ff).  The possible genotypes of the offspring are FF, Ff, Ff, and ff.

Therefore, the ratio of light yellow to dark yellow flowers is 4:0.  However, the provided options do not include 4:0.  The correct ratio, taking into account the question is asking for the expected ratio based on the phenotypes displayed, and the Punnett square, should be 3:1 (light yellow to dark yellow).""

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having a graying coat (1) having a graying coat
 Hint: This passage describes the coat graying trait in horses:

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for not having a graying coat (g) is recessive to the allele for having a graying coat (G).
Maverick is a horse from this group. Maverick has the heterozygous genotype Gg for the coat graying gene.
 Solution: You need to determine Maverick's phenotype for the coat graying trait. First, consider the alleles in Maverick's genotype for the coat graying gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for not having a graying coat (g) is recessive to the allele for having a graying coat (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Maverick's genotype of Gg has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Maverick's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be having a graying coat.

 Choices: (0) false (1) true
 Hint: Use the data to answer the question below.
 Solution: To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mercury.
Then compare the result to the volume of Saturn. The volume of Saturn is 8.27 x 10^14 km^3, which is more than 6.08 x 10^14 km^3. So, Saturn's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as Mercury's volume.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rough fur (1) soft fur
 Hint: In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f).
Gruff is a dachshund dog from this group. Gruff has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene.
 Solution: Gruff's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Gruff's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for soft fur. So, Gruff's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Gruff's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for rough fur (F) is dominant over the allele for soft fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Gruff's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Gruff's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be soft fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) CmACO1 gene . . . CmACO1 protein (1) CmACO1 protein . . . CmACO1 gene
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

In plants such as the European cantaloupe, fruit ripening is affected by a substance called ethylene (ETH-uh-leen). Ethylene is made inside a plant's cells with the help of a protein called CmACO1. The CmACO1 protein is encoded by the CmACO1 gene.
A certain European cantaloupe plant had a mutation in its CmACO1 gene. Compared to the CmACO1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CmACO1 gene encoded a form of the CmACO1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the CmACO1 protein could make only a small amount of ethylene. The fruits of this plant took longer to ripen than fruits from plants containing more ethylene. Farmers found this mutation useful because the fruit stayed good for a longer period of time after harvest.
Figure: a European cantaloupe.

2664	2664	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a king coat to offspring with a spotted coat? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 1:3 (2) 4:0 (3) 0:4 (4) 3:1
 Hint: This passage describes the coat pattern trait in cheetahs:
A cheetah with a spotted coat has many small black spots on its body. A cheetah with a king coat has large black splotches on its body and stripes on its back. King cheetahs are rarely seen in the wild. They were once thought to be a different species.
In a group of cheetahs, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a king coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a king coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a spotted coat (A).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cheetahs.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a king coat or a spotted coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for a king coat, is recessive to the A allele, which is for a spotted coat.
A king coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cheetah with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a king coat must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
A spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cheetah with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a king coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a king coat. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a spotted coat.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""3"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two cheetahs with the genotype AA.  Since the allele for a king coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a spotted coat (A), and both parents have the dominant allele, all offspring will have the genotype AA or Aa, resulting in a spotted coat.  Therefore, the ratio of offspring with a king coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 0:4. The provided choices don't include 0:4. The closest and most likely answer is 0:4, which implies no king coats and only spotted coats.  However, given the choices, 0:4 is not a choice.

The choice of 0:4 implies zero king coats and four spotted coats or zero king coats and four spotted coats  There's a critical error in the question; the provided choices are poor; there is no viable answer in the provided choice set.""

Phosphorus tribromide is ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) an elementary substance (1) a compound
 Hint: The model below represents a molecule of phosphorus tribromide. Phosphorus tribromide is used to make certain types of medicine.
 Solution: Use the model to determine whether phosphorus tribromide is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that a molecule of phosphorus tribromide is composed of one phosphorus atom and three bromine atoms bonded together.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a yellow ground spot (1) a white ground spot
 Hint: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:

In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g).
A certain watermelon plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the ground spot color gene.
 Solution: The watermelon plant's genotype for the ground spot color gene is gg. The watermelon plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for a white ground spot. So, the watermelon plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait must be a white ground spot.
To check this answer, consider whether the watermelon plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a yellow ground spot (G) is dominant over the allele for a white ground spot (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The watermelon plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the watermelon plant's phenotype for the ground spot color trait must be a white ground spot.

Many students, parents, and teachers cringe at the idea of sending kids to school year-round, but it would improve academic performance. Lengthy summer vacations were not established to accommodate farming schedules, as most people assume; they were started so that wealthy families could leave the city in the hot summer months and vacation in the country. Studies have shown that as a result of ""summer slide,"" many students returning to school in the fall have forgotten what they learned the previous year. Year-round school would provide consistency and help students learn more.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a golden body (1) a gray body
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b).
Sandy is a guppy from this group. Sandy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body color gene.
 Solution: Sandy's genotype for the body color gene is bb. Sandy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a golden body. So, Sandy's phenotype for the body color trait must be a golden body.
To check this answer, consider whether Sandy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a golden body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Sandy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sandy's phenotype for the body color trait must be a golden body.

 Solution: To determine if there is a net force on Francesca, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Francesca down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Francesca up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Francesca.

 Hint: Below is a food web from a tundra ecosystem in Nunavut, a territory in Northern Canada.
A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem.
 Solution: Decomposers help break down dead organisms into simpler matter, such as nutrients. These nutrients can then help plants and other organisms grow. In a food web, there is an arrow pointing from another organism to a decomposer. There are no arrows pointing from a decomposer to another organism.
The parasitic jaeger has an arrow pointing from it. So, the parasitic jaeger is not a decomposer.

2897	2897	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:
Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for dumbo ears (e) is recessive to the allele for normal ears (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the e allele, which is for dumbo ears, is recessive to the E allele, which is for normal ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ee. This box is highlighted below.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 1:3. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 1 offspring with dumbo ears for every 3 offspring with normal ears.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""1"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygous rats (Ee).  One box shows the recessive genotype (ee) for dumbo ears, and three boxes show the dominant genotypes (EE or Ee) for normal ears.  Therefore, the ratio of dumbo ears to normal ears is 1:3.""

 Hint: In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for brown eyes (E).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two guinea pigs.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with red eyes or brown eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the e allele, which is for red eyes, is recessive to the E allele, which is for brown eyes.
Red eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A guinea pig with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.
Brown eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A guinea pig with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with brown eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with red eyes to offspring with brown eyes is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with red eyes. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with brown eyes.

2926	2926	"Question: Based on this information, what is Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) black fur (1) brown fur
 Hint: In a group of Labrador retrievers, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
Bandit is a Labrador retriever from this group. Bandit has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene.
 Solution: Bandit's genotype for the fur color gene is FF. Bandit's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for black fur. So, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait must be black fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Bandit's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Bandit's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Bandit's phenotype for the fur color trait must be black fur.

 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Pebbles is a guppy from this group. Pebbles has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Pebbles's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Pebbles's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Pebbles's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Pebbles's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Pebbles's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Solution B (1) Solution A (2) neither; their concentrations are the same
 Hint: The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.
 Solution: In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles.

2959	2959	"Question: Based on this information, what is Athena's phenotype for the fur color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) orange fur (1) white fur
 Hint: In a group of Bengal tigers, some individuals have orange fur and others have white fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for white fur (f) is recessive to the allele for orange fur (F).
Athena is a Bengal tiger from this group. Athena has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur color gene.
 Solution: Athena's genotype for the fur color gene is FF. Athena's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for orange fur. So, Athena's phenotype for the fur color trait must be orange fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Athena's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white fur (f) is recessive to the allele for orange fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Athena's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Athena's phenotype for the fur color trait must be orange fur.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having sickle-cell disease (1) Aa
 Hint: This passage describes the sickle-cell disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have sickle-cell disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the sickle-cell disease trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having sickle-cell disease, and the allele a is for having sickle-cell disease.
Deion, a human from this group, does not have sickle-cell disease. Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease and one allele for having sickle-cell disease.
 Solution: An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Deion has one allele for not having sickle-cell disease (A) and one allele for having sickle-cell disease (a). So, Deion's genotype for the sickle-cell disease gene is Aa.

3008	3008	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have myotonia congenita, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. The question tells you that the m allele, which is for not having myotonia congenita, is recessive to the M allele, which is for having myotonia congenita.
Having myotonia congenita is the dominant allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. A goat with the dominant version of the myotonia congenita trait must have at least one dominant allele for the myotonia congenita gene. So, offspring that have myotonia congenita must have the genotype MM or Mm.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype MM or Mm.
Not having myotonia congenita is the recessive allele's version of the myotonia congenita trait. A goat with the recessive version of the myotonia congenita trait must have only recessive alleles for the myotonia congenita gene. So, offspring that do not have myotonia congenita must have the genotype mm.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype mm.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have myotonia congenita to offspring that do not have myotonia congenita is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that have myotonia congenita. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that do not have myotonia congenita.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
 ""answer"": ""4"",
 ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two goats, both of whom have myotonia congenita (Mm).  There are four possible offspring genotypes: Mm, Mm, Mm, Mm.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 0:4 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of American curl cats, some individuals have curled ears and others have straight ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for curled ears (E) is dominant over the allele for straight ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight ears or curled ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for curled ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for straight ears.
Straight ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. An American curl cat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with straight ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Curled ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. An American curl cat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with curled ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with straight ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with curled ears.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": ""1"",
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two American curl cats, both heterozygous (Ee).  Since the curled ear allele (E) is dominant, any offspring with at least one E allele will have curled ears.

Thus, the expected ratio of offspring with straight ears to offspring with curled ears is 0:4, which simplifies to 0:4 or 0/4 or 0.""

3055	3055	"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a black coat to offspring with a spotted coat? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 3:1 (3) 4:0 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a black coat (a).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two leopards.
 Solution: To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a black coat or a spotted coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for a spotted coat, is dominant over the a allele, which is for a black coat.
A black coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A leopard with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
A spotted coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A leopard with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with a spotted coat must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a black coat to offspring with a spotted coat is 1:3. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 1 offspring with a black coat for every 3 offspring with a spotted coat.
 Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"```json
{
  ""answer"": 1,
  ""solution"": ""The Punnett square shows a cross between two heterozygous leopards (Aa).  There are 3 boxes representing offspring with a spotted coat (AA or Aa) and 1 box representing offspring with a black coat (aa). Therefore, the ratio of black coat to spotted coat offspring is 1:3.""

Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Glass melting is caused by heating. But sewing an apron is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling.

Fanning eggs increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in (1) the male's offspring will become adults (2) the male will spend more energy while waving his fins
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time. This behavior is called fanning.
By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch.
Figure: a fifteen-spined stickleback.
 Solution: Look for the part of the passage that describes the effect of fanning eggs. Use this information to determine why this behavior can increase the reproductive success of the male fifteen-spined stickleback.
Choice ""Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females.

3121	3121	"Question: Based on this information, what is Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted tail (1) an unspotted tail
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a spotted tail and others have an unspotted tail. In this group, the gene for the tail spots trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i).
Sebastian is a guppy from this group. Sebastian has the homozygous genotype ii for the tail spots gene.
 Solution: Sebastian's genotype for the tail spots gene is ii. Sebastian's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for an unspotted tail. So, Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Sebastian's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Sebastian's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Sebastian's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straight fur (1) wavy fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Briar is a Syrian hamster from this group. Briar has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur texture gene.
 Solution: Briar's genotype for the fur texture gene is FF. Briar's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Briar's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Briar's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Briar's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be straight fur.
