5,not having horns,"Daffodil has the genotype HH, which means she has two dominant alleles for not having horns (H). Therefore, Daffodil does not have horns because the recessive allele for horns (h) is not present."
6,New Zealand falcon,"Both bald eagles and New Zealand falcons have feet adapted for grabbing prey, making the New Zealand falcon the correct choice."
9,yes,"Like all plants, Lithops bromfieldii, also known as the living stone, is made up of many cells. Cells are the basic units of life and are responsible for all functions in a plant. The visible appearance of Lithops bromfieldii may suggest simplicity, but structurally, it is composed of a complexity of cells that work together to support its lifecycle."
10,Cape vulture,"Both the red-tailed hawk and the Cape vulture have beaks adapted to tear through meat. The red-tailed hawk eats fish, mammals, and other birds, while the Cape vulture feeds on carrion. The 'sand martin' has a beak adapted for digging sand to find insects."
11,verbal irony,"Verbal irony is when the meaning is the opposite of what is actually said. In this case, the sentence is stating that the ancient pug is very energetic when the actual intended meaning is that the pug is very lazy and sleeps all day."

20,barren-ground caribou,"A consumer is an organism that eats other organisms.

On the other hand, 'bear sedge' is a producer, as it produces its own food through photosynthesis."
21,a ship that moved 95kilometers south in 10hours,"Let's calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. 1. For the first ship: 555 kilometers / 10 hours = 55.5 kilometers per hour 2. For the second ship: 460 kilometers / 10 hours = 46 kilometers per hour 3. For the third ship: 95 kilometers / 10 hours = 9.5 kilometers per hour Comparing the speeds, we have: 55.5 km/h > 46 km/h > 9.5 km/h Therefore, the ship moving at the lowest speed is the one that moved 95 kilometers south in 10 hours. Answer:"
22,Ff,Sasha has short fur (Ff).
24,4:0,"In the given Punnett square, both parents are homozygous dominant with red eyes (EE). The possible genotypes for their offspring are represented in all cells (EE). Since both alleles from each parent are E, the genotype of all potential offspring is EE, which results in red eyes. Therefore, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4."
