Please output the answer in JSON style with an answer and a solution field"	"{""answer"": ""115 meters"", ""solution"": ""To better understand the estimation, let's consider the standard dimensions of a soccer (football) field. Internationally, a soccer field typically measures about 100 to 130 yards in length and 50 to 100 yards in width. Since 1 yard is approximately 3 feet, this means the length is roughly 300 to 390 feet and the width is 150 to 300 feet. Therefore, when estimating, it is reasonable to expect the length of a soccer field to be in the range of hundreds of feet. Hence, '115 meters' is the correct choice since 1 meter is approximately 3.28 feet. The other option, '115 centimeters', is too short. A centimeter is about the width of a standard pencil, making '115 centimeters' significantly shorter than the range of hundreds of feet for a soccer field."" }"	"natural science"
