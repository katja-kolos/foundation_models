# Warning

Issue 1: This output is incomplete (1441 first datapoints) and is here to give a rough estimation of LLaVA1.5-7b on our data.
First observations: it does sometimes obtain correct-like responses, although sometimes produces empty response. 

Issue 2: The output format currently in the answer field is not the number of the correct answer but the correct answer as a string. I still need to check if this has a match with one of the choices in 100% cases.
