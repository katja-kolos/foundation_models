In the 1970s, architect I. M. Pei took on the difficult assignment of renovating and updating the beautiful Louvre Palace in Paris without overpowering the original building. The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances. It also needed more restrooms and a bigger cafeteria. Pei designed a large central underground entrance and visitor center. He then added a glass pyramid above the entryway. Although Pei's design faced initial criticism, today the pyramid is considered a brilliant success—a landmark that complements the old palace without interfering with it.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.

Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
