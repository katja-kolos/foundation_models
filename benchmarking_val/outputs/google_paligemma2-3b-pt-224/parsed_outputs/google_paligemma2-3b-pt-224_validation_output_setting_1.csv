In the 1970s, architect I. M. Pei took on the difficult assignment of renovating and updating the beautiful Louvre Palace in Paris without overpowering the original building. The art museum in the centuries-old Louvre displayed Leonardo DaVinci's Mona Lisa and other famous works, but the building's layout was so confusing that tourists couldn't find the entrances. It also needed more restrooms and a bigger cafeteria. Pei designed a large central underground entrance and visitor center. He then added a glass pyramid above the entryway. Although Pei's design faced initial criticism, today the pyramid is considered a brilliant success—a landmark that complements the old palace without interfering with it.

"273"	"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree.

 Choices: ['the bottles with lids kept on', 'the bottles with lids taken off']
 Hint: The passage below describes an experiment.

Steve wanted to freeze soda to make popsicles. He knew that soda contains carbon dioxide gas, which forms bubbles as it escapes from the liquid. He wondered if the popsicles would freeze more quickly if he removed the carbon dioxide.
Steve took the lids off three small bottles of soda. He left the lids off overnight so that carbon dioxide could escape from the bottles. He kept the lids on three other bottles to keep the carbon dioxide in. The next morning, Steve placed all six bottles in the freezer. After two hours, he checked whether soda in any of the bottles had frozen.
Figure: soda with carbon dioxide bubbles.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: [""It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age."", 'It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles.', ""It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure."", 'It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.']
 Hint: Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive.

 Choices: ['FliG protein . . . FliG gene', 'FliG gene . . . FliG protein']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Certain types of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria have long, thin structures called flagella. The flagella on these bacteria can spin. This motion propels the bacteria and allows them to move through their environments.
Flagella are assembled from many different proteins that stick to each other. Parts of the E. coli flagella are made up of a protein called FliG. The FliG protein is encoded by the FliG gene.
Scientists discovered some E. coli cells that had no flagella. These bacteria had a mutation in the FliG gene. Compared to the FliG gene without a mutation, the mutated FliG gene encoded a form of the FliG protein with a different structure.
This different form of the FliG protein could not stick to other flagella proteins.

 Choices: ['parasitic', 'mutualistic', 'commensal']
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Epiphytic orchids are flowering plants that can grow in tropical forests. An orchid can grow on tree branches in the canopy, or upper layer of the forest.
In the canopy, the orchid gets more sunlight than it would in the shadowy lower parts of the forest. The additional sunlight allows the orchid to perform more photosynthesis. There is also more wind in the canopy, which helps the orchid spread its seeds to other branches.
The orchid does not damage the tree it grows on, but it also does not provide resources to the tree.

 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Pseudoscorpions are small arachnids that often crawl onto the backs of large beetles, such as harlequin beetles.
When a beetle with a pseudoscorpion on its back flies away, the pseudoscorpion rides along. This ride helps the pseudoscorpion disperse, or move to a new location, much faster and farther than it could on its own.
When the pseudoscorpion is carried along, it does not harm the beetle, but it does not help the beetle, either.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['Fgfr1a1 protein . . . fgfr1a1 gene', 'fgfr1a1 gene . . . Fgfr1a1 protein']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Common carp are a type of fish that have scales on their bodies. The pattern of scales on a common carp is established while the fish is developing inside its egg. During this time, a protein called Fgfr1a1 sends signals to the fish's body that direct the shape and spacing of the fish's scales. The signals from the Fgfr1a1 protein result in common carp with small, evenly spaced scales.
The Fgfr1a1 protein is encoded by the fgfr1a1 gene.
A certain carp had large, patchy scales because of a mutation in the fgfr1a1 gene. Compared to the fgfr1a1 gene without a mutation, the mutated fgfr1a1 gene encoded a form of the Fgfr1a1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the Fgfr1a1 protein could not send signals to the fish's body.

Acacia ants spend most of their lives on bullhorn acacia trees. Up to 30,000 ants can live together in a colony on one acacia tree!
The ants eat nectar produced by the tree and build nests inside hollowed-out thorns on the tree's branches. The ants also attack insects and other animals that try to eat the tree's leaves. Sometimes the ants leave the tree and destroy nearby plants. This creates open space around the tree. The open space makes it easier for the acacia tree to get resources such as sunlight and water.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['CmACO1 gene . . . CmACO1 protein', 'CmACO1 protein . . . CmACO1 gene']
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

In plants such as the European cantaloupe, fruit ripening is affected by a substance called ethylene (ETH-uh-leen). Ethylene is made inside a plant's cells with the help of a protein called CmACO1. The CmACO1 protein is encoded by the CmACO1 gene.
A certain European cantaloupe plant had a mutation in its CmACO1 gene. Compared to the CmACO1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CmACO1 gene encoded a form of the CmACO1 protein with a different structure.
This different form of the CmACO1 protein could make only a small amount of ethylene. The fruits of this plant took longer to ripen than fruits from plants containing more ethylene. Farmers found this mutation useful because the fruit stayed good for a longer period of time after harvest.
Figure: a European cantaloupe.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['1:3', '2:2', '3:1', '0:4', '4:0']
 Hint: This passage describes the myotonia congenita trait in goats:
Myotonia congenita is a condition that causes temporary muscle stiffness. When goats with myotonia congenita attempt to run from a resting position, their leg muscles often stiffen, causing them to fall over. Because of this behavior, these goats are referred to as fainting goats. Myotonia congenita is also found in other mammals, including horses, cats, and humans.
In a group of goats, some individuals have myotonia congenita and others do not. In this group, the gene for the myotonia congenita trait has two alleles. The allele for not having myotonia congenita (m) is recessive to the allele for having myotonia congenita (M).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two goats.

Fanning eggs increases the chances that ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: ['the male will build a nest for females to lay eggs in', ""the male's offspring will become adults"", 'the male will spend more energy while waving his fins']
 Hint: Animals often behave in certain ways that can increase their reproductive success. Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.

Fifteen-spined sticklebacks are small fish that live in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Male sticklebacks build nests for their eggs. Then, the males mate with multiple females. After a male mates with a female, she lays eggs in the male's nest and then leaves. The male guards his nest until the eggs hatch. As he guards the nest, he waves his fins near the eggs for short periods of time. This behavior is called fanning.
By fanning his nest, a male stickleback can help bring fresh water and nutrients to the eggs. The more frequently a male fans his eggs, the more eggs hatch.
