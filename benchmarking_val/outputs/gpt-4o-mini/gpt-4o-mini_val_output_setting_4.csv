	"What does the verbal irony in this text suggest?
According to Mr. Herrera's kids, his snoring is as quiet as a jackhammer."	['The snoring is loud.', 'The snoring occurs in bursts.']	0		closed choice	grade8	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Interpret figures of speech	"Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
Verbal irony involves saying one thing but implying something very different. People often use verbal irony when they are being sarcastic.
Olivia seems thrilled that her car keeps breaking down.
Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Herrera's snoring."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The verbal irony in the text suggests that Mr. Herrera's snoring is indeed loud, despite the comparison made by his kids. The phrase ""as quiet as a jackhammer"" is inherently contradictory, as jackhammers are known for their loud noise. By using this hyperbolic comparison, the children are emphasizing the disruptive nature of Mr. Herrera's snoring, underscoring that it is anything but quiet. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the irony is that the snoring is loud."

['discus', 'armored catfish']	1	"Sturgeons eat invertebrates, plants, and small fish. They are bottom feeders. Bottom feeders find their food at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.
The 's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding.
Figure: sturgeon."	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: beaks, mouths, and necks	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the sturgeon.
The sturgeon's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding. The sturgeon uses its mouth to find food hidden in the sediment at the bottom of rivers, lakes, and the ocean.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The armored catfish's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding.
The discus's mouth is not located on the underside of its head. Its mouth is not adapted for bottom feeding."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the armored catfish because its mouth is located on the underside of its head and is specifically adapted for bottom feeding, similar to the sturgeon. Both animals use their downward-pointing mouths to find food in sediments at the bottom of water bodies. In contrast, the discus does not have a mouth adapted for this purpose, as it is not located on the underside of its head. Therefore, the armored catfish is the correct choice for an animal with a similar adaptation to bottom feeding."

This fragment is missing a verb. It doesn't tell what the band I'm in is doing.
Because we have a concert in two weeks.
This fragment is missing an independent clause. It doesn't tell what happened because of the concert."	"This is a sentence fragment. It does not express a complete thought.

Here is one way to fix the sentence fragment:
During the construction of Mount Rushmore, approximately eight hundred million pounds of rock were removed from the mountain to create the monument."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The original text is indeed a sentence fragment because it lacks a main verb and does not complete a thought. It starts with a prepositional phrase ""During the construction of Mount Rushmore,"" but does not have an independent clause to provide context or meaning. The suggested revision corrects this by adding a verb (""were removed"") and creating a complete thought, thus transforming the fragment into a full sentence."
	Which correctly shows the title of a play?	['A breath of Fresh Air', 'A Breath of Fresh Air']	1		closed choice	grade3	language science	capitalization	Formatting	Capitalizing titles	"In a title, capitalize the first word, the last word, and every important word in between.

Hint: Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place."	closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	Weather and climate around the world	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the passage carefully.
Chicago is known as The Windy City. But on average, the wind there only blows at about 10 miles per hour.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the usual wind patterns in Chicago. This passage does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The passage discusses the average wind speed in Chicago, which indicates a long-term pattern rather than a specific weather event. This aligns with the definition of climate, which refers to the typical atmospheric conditions over an extended period in a particular area. The phrase ""on average"" further emphasizes that the information pertains to climate rather than a singular weather occurrence. Therefore, the passage describes the climate of Chicago."
	Based on this information, what is Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait?	['not having horns', 'having horns']	0	"In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Daffodil is a cow from this group. Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Daffodil's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Daffodil's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Daffodil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Daffodil's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Daffodil has the homozygous genotype HH, which consists exclusively of dominant alleles for the horns trait. The allele H represents the phenotype of not having horns, and since Daffodil has two copies of this dominant allele, she will exhibit this trait. Therefore, Daffodil's phenotype for the horns trait is that she does not have horns, corresponding to choice (0)."

Figure: bald eagle."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: feet and limbs	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground."	"Look at the picture of the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey. The sharp claws can help the bald eagle attack and kill its prey. The long toes can help it hold on to its prey.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The New Zealand falcon has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey.
The sable has hoofed feet. Its feet are not adapted for grabbing prey. The sable uses its feet to walk and run on hard ground."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the New Zealand falcon because, like the bald eagle, it has long toes with sharp claws that are specifically adapted for grabbing prey. This adaptation allows the falcon to effectively catch and hold onto its food, which is essential for its hunting strategy. In contrast, the sable has hoofed feet that are not designed for capturing prey, making it unsuitable for this task. Therefore, the New Zealand falcon is the correct choice as it shares a similar adaptation with the bald eagle."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=355x307 at 0x31307E330>	"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	['true', 'false']	1	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	"ANSWER: 1 

SOLUTION: The statement claims that Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times the volume of Mars. Jupiter's volume is approximately 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, while Mars' volume is about 1.63 x 10^11 km^3. When calculating 10,000 times the volume of Mars, we get approximately 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. Since 1.43 x 10^15 km^3 (Jupiter's volume) is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3, the statement is false. Thus, the correct choice is false."

['landing on', 'kissing']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Creative techniques	Use personification	"Personification is giving human characteristics to nonhuman things. It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the word kissing. It describes the raindrops as if they were people showing affection.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""kissing"" because it personifies the raindrops by attributing them with the human action of kissing, which conveys affection and tenderness. This choice creates a vivid image of the raindrops gently touching the fans' cheeks, enhancing the emotional connection between nature and the spectators. In contrast, ""landing on"" lacks this emotional depth and does not personify the raindrops in the same way. Thus, ""kissing"" effectively fulfills the requirement for personification in the sentence."

The sand martin has a short, thin beak. Its beak is not adapted to tear through meat. The sand martin uses its beak to eat insects and other small invertebrates."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose the Cape vulture because it has a sharp hooked beak that is specifically adapted for tearing through meat, similar to the red-tailed hawk mentioned in the text. The sand martin, on the other hand, has a short, thin beak that is not suited for tearing meat, as it is designed for eating insects and small invertebrates.

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a car's gas tank is 40 liters.
40 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 40 liters  
SOLUTION: The volume of a typical car's gas tank is significantly larger than 40 milliliters, which is only a small fraction of a liter. Most cars have gas tanks that range from approximately 40 to 70 liters, making 40 liters a reasonable estimate for a standard vehicle. In contrast, 40 milliliters is insufficient to even fill a small container, let alone a car's gas tank, making it an implausible choice.

SOLUTION: On a cold, rainy day, temperatures are typically quite low, and 41°F is a more realistic estimate for such conditions, especially in regions where cold rain is common. In contrast, 41°C is excessively hot and does not align with the characteristics of a cold, rainy environment. Therefore, the better estimate for the air temperature on a cold, rainy day is 41°F."

A lemon has a sour taste. Both objects are sour.
Potato chips have a salty taste. The lime is not salty.
The property that both objects have in common is sour."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task asks to identify a common property shared by two objects. In this case, a lemon is identified as having a sour taste, while potato chips have a salty taste. Since the lime is also categorized as sour, it confirms that both objects (lemon and lime) share the property of being sour, while potato chips do not share that property. Therefore, sour is the correct answer, represented by the number 1."

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Ecosystems	Interpret food webs	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Consumers eat other organisms. So, there are arrows in a food web that point from other organisms to consumers.
The barren-ground caribou has an arrow pointing to it from the lichen. So, the barren-ground caribou is a consumer.
The bear sedge does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the bear sedge is a producer, not a consumer."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The barren-ground caribou is indicated as a consumer because there is an arrow pointing to it from the lichen, showing that it derives energy by consuming this plant. In contrast, the bear sedge does not have any arrows pointing to it, which signifies that it does not consume other organisms; instead, it operates as a producer in the food web. Thus, based on the presence or absence of arrows, the barren-ground caribou is the only consumer among the options given."
	Compare the motion of three ships. Which ship was moving at the lowest speed?	['a ship that moved 555kilometers west in 10hours', 'a ship that moved 95kilometers south in 10hours', 'a ship that moved 460kilometers south in 10hours']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 10 hours. The ship that moved 95 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. All three ships traveled for 10 hours, so we focus on the distances: the first ship traveled 555 kilometers, the second ship 95 kilometers, and the third ship 460 kilometers. The speeds are 55.5 km/h for the first ship, 9.5 km/h for the second ship, and 46 km/h for the third ship. Since the second ship traveled the least distance, it had the lowest speed of 9.5 km/h."

In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele F is for short fur, and the allele f is for long fur.
Sasha, a dog from this group, has short fur. Sasha has one allele for short fur and one allele for long fur."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Sasha's observable version of the fur length trait is short fur. So, Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is short fur.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Sasha's phenotype for the fur length trait is short fur, which is the observable characteristic of her fur. Based on the information provided, she has one allele for short fur (F) and one for long fur (f), making her genotype Ff. However, the phenotype is determined by the dominant trait, which is short fur in this case. Therefore, the correct choice that represents Sasha's phenotype is short fur."

The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black eyes. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red eyes."	"ANSWER: 4:0  
SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to those with red eyes is determined by analyzing the genotypes produced from the Punnett square. Since the allele for red eyes (E) is dominant and the allele for black eyes (e) is recessive, only fish with the genotype ee can have black eyes. In the given scenario, all offspring are produced with the genotype ee, resulting in 4 boxes for black eyes and 0 boxes for red eyes. Therefore, the ratio of black-eyed to red-eyed offspring is 4:0, indicating that all offspring will have black eyes."

He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the shopping bag that is heavier.
A shopping bag holding 5 pounds of food is heavier than a shopping bag holding 4 pounds of food. So, the bag holding 5 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other bag."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose the bag holding 5 pounds of food because it is heavier than the bag holding 4 pounds. When lifting objects at the same speed, the force exerted must overcome the weight of the objects. Since the 5-pound bag weighs more, it requires a larger force to be lifted compared to the 4-pound bag, even if both bags are lifted at the same speed. Therefore, the bag holding 5 pounds will be lifted with a larger force."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | a personal attack meant to discredit one's opponent
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself
guilt by association | an unfair negative association with another person or group that is intended to discredit someone or something
red herring | the use of a completely unrelated topic in support of a claim

false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a very broad claim based on very little evidence

"	The text argues that Richard can't be trusted with money, because his uncle embezzled money. However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Richard can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The argument presented in the text employs the logical fallacy of guilt by association. It attempts to discredit Richard's ability to serve as class treasurer based on the actions of his uncle, implying that Richard is untrustworthy because of his uncle's criminal behavior. This reasoning is flawed, as it does not provide any evidence of Richard's character or capabilities, but rather makes an unjust connection between him and his uncle's misconduct."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a chemical change. The salt and vinegar change the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. This makes the penny look shiny again.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The process of salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is classified as a chemical change because it involves a reaction that alters the chemical composition of the tarnish. The acids in vinegar react with the copper oxide (the tarnish) to form new substances, which can then be removed, resulting in a shiny penny. This transformation indicates that the original material has been chemically altered, distinguishing it from a physical change, where no new substances are formed.

Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking a pancake is a chemical change. Pancakes are made from pancake batter. A cooked pancake is a different type of matter than pancake batter. Pancake batter is wet and slippery. Cooked pancakes are fluffy and can be good to eat!
Rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bicycle frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But rust forming on a bicycle frame is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: Both cooking a pancake and rust forming on a bicycle frame are examples of chemical changes, where the original substances undergo a transformation to create new substances with different properties. Cooking a pancake transforms the batter into a fluffy, edible product, while rust formation alters iron into a reddish-brown compound that is structurally different from the original metal. Hence, the commonality between these two changes is that they both involve chemical reactions."

The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks."	"Look at the picture of the scarlet macaw.
The scarlet macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The scarlet macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.

SOLUTION: The Alexandrine parakeet has a thick hooked beak, which is similar to that of the scarlet macaw. This adaptation allows both birds to effectively crack open large, hard nuts, making the Alexandrine parakeet suitable for this task. In contrast, the blue rock pigeon has a short, thin beak that is not designed for cracking nuts, indicating that it is not adapted for this specific feeding behavior.

Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant."	"When pollen lands on a female cone, it is called pollination. This photograph shows wind blowing pollen from the male cones on a Japanese cedar tree.
Photosynthesis happens when plants use water, carbon dioxide, and energy from sunlight to make sugar."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""Pollination"" as the answer because the task specifically asks for the term that describes what occurs when pollen lands on a female cone. The hint provided indicates that male cones produce pollen, which can be carried by the wind to female cones, leading to the process of pollination.

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.

In this group, the gene for the fur length trait has two alleles. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f).
Chanel is a cat from this group. Chanel has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur length gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Chanel's genotype for the fur length gene is FF. Chanel's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for short fur. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Chanel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Chanel's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chanel's phenotype for the fur length trait must be short fur."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Chanel's genotype is FF, which consists of two dominant alleles for the fur length trait. The allele for short fur (F) is dominant over the allele for long fur (f), meaning that any cat with at least one F allele will exhibit the short fur phenotype. Since Chanel has no recessive alleles (f), her phenotype is determined solely by the dominant alleles, leading to the conclusion that she has short fur. Thus, the correct answer is 0, indicating short fur."

Like other spiders, a black widow spider is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose the Yangtze alligator as the vertebrate because it belongs to the class of reptiles, which are characterized by having a backbone. In contrast, the other options—black widow spider, bull ant, and atlas moth—are all invertebrates, meaning they lack a backbone and have exoskeletons instead.

All three bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 22°C bowl of oatmeal is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The object with the least thermal energy is the bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 22°C, which corresponds to choice (1). Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; lower temperatures indicate lower thermal energy.

The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to their temperature. Since the particles in sample A have a higher average speed compared to those in sample B, this indicates that they possess greater average kinetic energy. Therefore, because higher average kinetic energy corresponds to a higher temperature, sample A must have the higher temperature. Thus, the correct choice is that sample A has the higher temperature."

Find the quotation ""Vanity, not love, has been my folly"" in the bubble map. It is directly connected to judgmental, which is directly connected to Elizabeth. So, the quotation shows that Elizabeth is judgmental."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The quotation ""Vanity, not love, has been my folly"" reflects a self-critical acknowledgment that vanity, rather than genuine affection, has influenced the speaker's actions and decisions. In the context of the bubble map, this quotation is linked to the trait of being judgmental, which is associated with Elizabeth. This suggests that Elizabeth's judgments may stem from her own perceptions of vanity in others, highlighting her critical nature towards herself and those around her. Therefore, the quotation demonstrates that Elizabeth is indeed judgmental."

['the Indian Ocean', 'the Arctic Ocean', 'the Pacific Ocean']	1		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects the Arctic Ocean. It does not intersect the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The prime meridian, which is located at 0° longitude, primarily runs through the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the northern latitudes. It does not cross the Indian Ocean or the Pacific Ocean, as these bodies of water are situated to the east and west of the prime meridian, respectively. Therefore, among the given choices, the Arctic Ocean is the only correct option where the prime meridian intersects."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a can of soup is 12 ounces.
12 pounds and 12 tons are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 12 ounces  
SOLUTION: The mass of a typical can of soup is generally around 12 ounces, making it a standard size for most canned goods. The other options, 12 pounds and 12 tons, are significantly heavier and not realistic for a single can of soup. Given that most soup cans are designed for individual servings, 12 ounces is the most reasonable and accurate estimate of their mass. Thus, it is the best choice among the provided options."

None, I think, do there embrace is an understatement, since people who have died obviously can't do anything at all."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs understatement, particularly in the line ""None, I think, do there embrace,"" which downplays the reality of death by suggesting a lack of physical affection in the grave. This is a deliberate minimization of the finality and seriousness of death, as it implies that the deceased are merely absent from physical interactions rather than being completely lifeless.

The collared dove has soft feathers covering its skin. Its body is not adapted for protection against predators with sharp teeth."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the queen conch (0) because it has a hard outer shell that serves as a protective barrier against predators with sharp teeth, similar to the nautilus. In contrast, the collared dove (1) has soft feathers that do not provide adequate protection against such predators. The adaptation of a hard shell in the queen conch makes it difficult for predators to inflict harm, which aligns with the requirement of being better adapted for protection.

Complete the sentence with the word winked. It describes the stars as if they were people looking down and noticing us.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the word ""winked"" because it attributes a human action to the stars, giving them a sense of awareness and playfulness. This personification suggests that the stars are not just glowing in the sky, but are actively engaging with us by ""winking."" This imagery enhances the sense of wonder and connection between the observer and the cosmos, making the experience more relatable and imaginative.

Every force has a direction.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The child pushes the button. The direction of the push is away from his finger.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The child is using his finger to apply force to the button in the elevator. When he presses the button, the force exerted is directed away from his finger, as he is pushing it down. This means the action of pushing the button results in the button being pressed away from his finger, making the correct answer ""away from his finger.""

the pattern of weather, or climate
the type of soil
the organisms that live there"	A cold desert is a type of ecosystem. Cold deserts have the following features: a small amount of rain or snow, dry, thin soil, and long, cold winters. So, the following statements describe the Gobi Desert ecosystem: a small amount of rain or snow, dry, thin soil, and long, cold winters. It has a small amount of rain or snow. It has long, cold winters. The following statement does not describe the Gobi Desert: a small amount of rain or snow, dry, thin soil, and long, cold winters. It has warm summers and mild winters.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The Gobi Desert is characterized as a cold desert ecosystem, which typically receives a small amount of precipitation, either in the form of rain or snow. The description of the Gobi Desert aligns with the choice stating it has a small amount of rain or snow, highlighting its dry conditions. In contrast, the statement about having warm summers and mild winters does not accurately reflect the Gobi Desert's climate, which features long, cold winters. Therefore, the correct choice is (1), as it accurately describes the Gobi Desert ecosystem."

In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two summer squash plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with fuzzy leaves or smooth leaves, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for fuzzy leaves, is dominant over the l allele, which is for smooth leaves.
Fuzzy leaves is the dominant allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the dominant version of the leaf texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy leaves must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
Smooth leaves is the recessive allele's version of the leaf texture trait. A summer squash plant with the recessive version of the leaf texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the leaf texture gene. So, offspring with smooth leaves must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with fuzzy leaves for every 2 offspring with smooth leaves."	"ANSWER: 2:2  
SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with fuzzy leaves to offspring with smooth leaves is determined by examining the genotypes that produce each phenotype. Since the fuzzy leaf allele (L) is dominant over the smooth leaf allele (l), offspring with at least one L allele (genotypes LL or Ll) will have fuzzy leaves, while only offspring with the genotype ll will have smooth leaves. In this case, there are equal numbers of boxes representing each phenotype in the Punnett square, leading to a ratio of 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. However, since the question asked for the most likely ratio without simplification, I maintained the form of 2:2."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnetic force between magnets is influenced by their distance from each other; closer magnets exert a stronger force. Given that the magnets in Pair 1 are positioned closer together than those in Pair 2, it follows that the magnetic force in Pair 1 is stronger. Therefore, the correct statement is that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1."

Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Perfume does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, perfume is not a mineral.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Perfume is not classified as a mineral because it does not meet the essential criteria that define minerals. Minerals are typically natural, inorganic solids with a definite chemical composition and a crystalline structure. In contrast, perfume is a human-made liquid that lacks a fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance, as it consists of various compounds and fragrances. Therefore, based on these properties, the answer is clearly ""no."""

Some thermometers measure temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F). Fahrenheit is one scale used to measure temperature.
This is a tube thermometer. It has a tube filled with a red liquid.
There is a Fahrenheit scale along the right side of the tube. The top of the red liquid lines up with the number 80 on the scale. So, the temperature shown by this thermometer is 80°F."	"Find the top of the red liquid.
Now look at the scale to the right. The top of the red liquid is halfway between 90 and 100. So, the temperature is 95°F."	"ANSWER: 95°F  
SOLUTION: The task involves reading a thermometer, which requires identifying the level of the red liquid in relation to the temperature scale. In this case, the top of the red liquid is positioned exactly halfway between the 90°F and 100°F marks. This indicates that the temperature is 95°F, as it is the midpoint of the two values.

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Jinx has two alleles for not having agouti fur (a). So, Jinx's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Jinx does not have agouti fur, which indicates that she possesses the recessive genotype for the agouti fur gene. The passage specifies that the allele ""a"" corresponds to not having agouti fur, and since Jinx has two alleles for this trait, her genotype must be ""aa."" Therefore, the correct answer indicating Jinx's genotype is ""aa,"" represented by choice (0)."

The temperature of each aquarium decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each aquarium decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each aquarium to the surroundings.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The scenario describes two identical aquariums, one covered and one uncovered, next to an open window. Over time, the uncovered aquarium would lose thermal energy to the surrounding environment, resulting in a decrease in temperature. Therefore, the correct statement is that thermal energy was transferred from each aquarium to the surroundings, which aligns with choice (1).

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram."	"The better estimate for the mass of an elephant is 6,090 kilograms.
6,090 grams is too light."	"ANSWER: 6,090 kilograms  
SOLUTION: Elephants are among the largest land animals, with adult elephants typically weighing between 2,200 to 6,800 kilograms, depending on the species. Therefore, the choice of 6,090 kilograms is much more representative of an elephant's mass compared to 6,090 grams, which is equivalent to just 6.09 kilograms—far too light for any elephant. The significant difference in the weight units makes 6,090 kilograms the only reasonable estimate for the mass of an elephant."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The correct answer is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than that in Pair 2. According to the principles of magnetism, the force between two magnets decreases with increasing distance. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, the only variable affecting the force is the distance between the magnets in each pair.

275 fluid ounces and 275 cups are both too little."	"ANSWER: 275 gallons  
SOLUTION: A kiddie pool typically holds a significant amount of water, and 275 gallons is a reasonable estimate for such a pool size. In contrast, 275 cups and 275 fluid ounces represent much smaller volumes, making them unsuitable for a kiddie pool's capacity. Gallons are the standard unit for measuring larger quantities of liquid, especially for pools, which is why 275 gallons is the most accurate choice among the given options."

SOLUTION: The word ""men"" is a closed syllable because it contains a vowel followed by one or more consonants. In this case, the vowel 'e' is followed by the consonant 'n', which creates a closed syllable structure. Additionally, closed syllables typically produce a short vowel sound, as is the case here with the short 'e' sound in ""men"". Thus, the correct choice is closed."

A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of gneiss match the properties of a rock. So, gneiss is a rock.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Gneiss is classified as a rock because it is composed of various mineral grains that are arranged in a banded or layered structure, which is characteristic of metamorphic rocks. It is not a pure substance since it contains a mixture of minerals and does not have a fixed crystal structure. Additionally, gneiss is naturally occurring and is formed through geological processes, further confirming its classification as a rock rather than a mineral.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.

A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Bleaching clothes is a chemical change. The bleach reacts with dark stains on the clothes. The reaction changes the stains into different types of matter that wash away easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Both a piece of apple turning brown and bleaching clothes are classified as chemical changes. In the case of the apple, the reaction with oxygen alters its chemical composition, resulting in browning. Similarly, the bleaching process involves a chemical reaction between bleach and the stains, transforming them into different substances. Therefore, the correct choice is that both are chemical changes."

Jayden will spend more money. Plane tickets for Jayden to get to Nevada are more expensive than tickets to Connecticut."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the task requires identifying a cost associated with Jayden's decision to travel to Nevada instead of Connecticut. The choice indicates that traveling to Nevada incurs higher expenses for plane tickets, which represents a financial cost. This aligns with Jayden's objective of saving money while enjoying his trip, making the increased expense a significant factor in his decision-making process."

SOLUTION: The description of Kibale National Forest as having year-round rain and many different types of organisms is accurate and aligns with the characteristics of a tropical rain forest. In contrast, option 1 mentions cold winters and nutrient-rich soil, which are not typical features of a tropical rain forest ecosystem. Furthermore, tropical rain forests generally have poor nutrient soil due to rapid decomposition and nutrient uptake by the diverse plant life.

Earth's gravity is pulling down on Kylie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Kylie with a force of 1,200N.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Kylie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Kylie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Kylie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Kylie."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The forces acting on Kylie are unbalanced because the upward force exerted by the seat (1,200 N) is greater than the downward force of gravity (600 N). This results in a net force acting on Kylie, which can be calculated as the difference between these two forces. Since there is a net force, it indicates that Kylie is experiencing acceleration in the upward direction, confirming that the forces are indeed unbalanced. Therefore, the correct choice is that there is a net force on Kylie."

You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The question asks about the relative strength of the magnetic force between two pairs of magnets. Given that distance affects magnetic force, and the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than those in Pair 2, it follows that the magnetic force in Pair 1 is indeed weaker. Therefore, the correct statement is that ""The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1."" This leads to the conclusion that option (2) is the true statement."

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair depends on the distance between them and the material they are made of. Since the problem states that all magnets are made of the same material and the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, the magnetic force must also be the same.

It is a pure substance.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
A brick is made by humans. But minerals are not made by living things.
A brick is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, a brick is not a mineral.
Quartz is a mineral.
Graphite is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A brick is the only substance among the choices that is made by humans, which disqualifies it from being classified as a mineral since minerals are naturally occurring substances. Additionally, bricks are not pure substances, whereas minerals, including graphite and quartz, are pure substances formed in nature. Therefore, the properties of a brick do not align with the characteristics of minerals, making it the correct answer."

The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a bike path is 3 kilometers.
3 centimeters is too short."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: A bike path is typically designed for recreational or commuting purposes and is usually several kilometers long, especially in urban or suburban areas. The option of 3 kilometers is more realistic compared to 3 centimeters, which is far too short to serve as a functional bike path. Therefore, 3 kilometers is the better estimate for the length of a bike path."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each speedboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each speedboat moved for 10 hours. The speedboat that moved 360 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that speedboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: To determine which speedboat was moving at the lowest speed, we calculate the speed of each. All speedboats traveled for 10 hours, so we divide the distance by the time. The first speedboat traveled 890 kilometers (89 km/h), the second traveled 880 kilometers (88 km/h), and the third traveled 360 kilometers (36 km/h). Since 36 km/h is the lowest speed among the three, the speedboat that moved 360 kilometers must have been moving at the lowest speed."

SOLUTION: The task asks for a common property shared by three objects: a chocolate bar, sugar, and candy sprinkles. Upon analysis, sugar is definitively sweet, and candy sprinkles often contain sugar, making them sweet as well. While the chocolate bar also has a sweet flavor, the other properties of being bouncy or fuzzy do not apply to all three objects. Therefore, the best answer is that all three objects are sweet."

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Regan's skin color is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Skin color is determined by genetic factors that are passed down from parents to their offspring. Since Regan's dark skin is a result of these genetic influences and not a result of personal choice or environmental factors, it is classified as an inherited trait.

The underlined part of the passage tells you about the usual pattern of humidity in Uganda. This passage does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The passage describes the usual pattern of humidity in Uganda during specific months (April and May), which indicates a long-term trend rather than a specific atmospheric condition at a certain time. This aligns with the definition of climate, as it refers to the average weather conditions over an extended period in a particular region. Therefore, the passage does not focus on the weather of a specific day, but rather on the overall climatic conditions in Uganda."
	What is the mass of a goat?	['75 ounces', '75 pounds', '75 tons']	1	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of mass	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a goat is 75 pounds.
75 ounces is too light and 75 tons is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The mass of an average goat is typically around 75 pounds, making it the most reasonable choice among the options provided. 75 ounces is significantly lighter than the average weight of a goat, while 75 tons is extraordinarily heavy and not applicable to any goat. Therefore, 75 pounds is the best estimate that aligns with common knowledge about goat weights."

For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses unique in its traditional sense: being the only one of its kind.
The Miranda warning, the reading of rights given to a suspect by police prior to questioning, is not unique to the United States; a number of other countries have equivalent rights, including Australia, South Africa, Switzerland, Thailand, and Kazakhstan.
The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Miranda v. Arizona was one of a few Supreme Court cases to have implications for law enforcement, so it was not one of a kind in that respect. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.
The Supreme Court case Miranda v. Arizona, which led to the institution of the Miranda warning, was quite unique in that it had significant implications for law enforcement. Only a handful of Supreme Court decisions have had such an impact on daily police procedure.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the second text clearly states that the Miranda warning is ""not unique to the United States,"" indicating that it is not one of a kind and has equivalents in other countries. This aligns with the traditional definition of ""unique"" as being the only one of its kind. In contrast, the first text uses ""unique"" in a nontraditional sense by implying that the case's significance makes it unusual rather than one of a kind, which does not adhere to the word's strict definition."

Complete the sentence with the phrase glared at. It describes the sun as if it were a person giving an angry look.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""glared at"" because it gives the sun a human-like quality, suggesting that it can express emotions such as anger or irritation. This personification helps to create a vivid image of how the sun's intensity affects the hikers, making it feel as if the sun is actively watching them. In contrast, ""warmed"" does not provide any personification, as it simply describes a natural phenomenon without attributing human-like characteristics to the sun."

Bob's brother wasn't feeling well, so Bob had to stay home with him."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice, ""Bob's brother wasn't feeling well, so Bob had to stay home with him,"" contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""him"" could refer to either Bob or his brother, leading to ambiguity about who is staying home. In contrast, the first answer choice clarifies the subject by explicitly stating ""his brother"" and clearly indicates that Bob is staying home due to his brother's illness.

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Ellie practices the drums in her family's garage"" uses the present tense, as indicated by the verb ""practices."" This verb form suggests that the action is currently happening or is a regular occurrence. Present tense verbs often end in -s when the subject is third-person singular, which is the case here with ""Ellie.""

Nancy will give up the chance to watch a movie with her sister."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the question focuses on identifying a cost associated with Nancy's decision to watch the comedy. By choosing to watch the comedy, Nancy sacrifices the opportunity to spend time with her sister, who is only interested in watching an action movie. This sacrifice represents a cost, as it involves giving up a valued experience for another preference. The other option, while positive, does not indicate a cost in the context of her decision-making."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to play basketball. Instead, some people learn how to play basketball. Playing the sport takes practice. So, playing basketball is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The trait of playing basketball is classified as an acquired trait because it is not something one is born with. Instead, it requires learning, practice, and experience to develop the necessary skills to play the sport effectively. Unlike inherited traits, which are passed down genetically, acquired traits are developed through individual experiences and efforts. Therefore, since playing basketball necessitates training and practice, it is considered an acquired skill."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Peter Pan is literature.
In a J. M. Barrie novel, the character Peter Pan retreats to Neverland and refuses to grow up.
The allusion Peter Pan means a person who won't take on adult responsibilities."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""Peter Pan"" originates from literature, specifically from J. M. Barrie's play and novel about the character who embodies eternal childhood and avoids the responsibilities of adulthood. In this context, describing someone as a ""typical Peter Pan type"" implies that they are similar to Peter Pan in their reluctance to grow up and take on adult responsibilities.

Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the ceramic mug is harder. If you press on a piece of ceramic, it will not change shape."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The ceramic mug is harder than the cotton apron because ceramic is a rigid material that maintains its shape when pressure is applied. In contrast, cotton is a soft fabric that can easily bend or deform when pushed. Thus, when comparing the hardness of the two materials, the ceramic mug clearly exhibits greater resistance to deformation, making it the harder option."

485 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: 485 milliliters  
SOLUTION: A typical water balloon can hold around 450 to 500 milliliters of water. Given this range, 485 milliliters is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a water balloon. On the other hand, 485 liters would be an excessively large volume, far exceeding the capacity of an average balloon.

The purple gallinule has long, thin toes on its feet. Its feet are not adapted for swimming. The purple gallinule uses its feet to walk on large leaves floating on the surface of the water."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the purple gallinule (0) because it is the only animal among the choices that has feet adapted for swimming, similar to the black-bellied whistling duck. The text specifies that the purple gallinule has long, thin toes that are not adapted for swimming but rather for walking on floating leaves, making it a less suitable choice.

The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.
The dainty flying squirrel

Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.
—From Alfred Noyes, ""The Highwayman""
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses real words:
Hark! the honey bee is humming.
—From Mary Howitt, ""The Voice of Spring"""	"This poem uses repetition. It repeats words, phrases, or lines.
Down, down, down!
Down to the depths of the sea!
Singing most joyfully."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose option 0 because it contains clear instances of repetition with the phrase ""Down, down, down!"" which is repeated several times at the beginning of the poem. This repetition emphasizes the descent to the depths of the sea and contributes to the rhythmic and musical quality of the poem. In contrast, option 1 does not exhibit notable repetition in its structure or wording, focusing instead on a descriptive portrayal of the winter landscape."

Bridgette dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Paul, who was standing below the balcony."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Kinetic and potential energy	Identify changes in gravitational potential energy	"Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Paul was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Paul, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Paul."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: As the water balloon fell toward Paul, its height above the ground decreased, which in turn decreased its distance from the center of the Earth. Gravitational potential energy is directly related to height; as the height decreases, the potential energy also decreases. Therefore, since the water balloon was moving closer to the Earth, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and the Earth decreased."

Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Manuel noticed that the sky was filled with cumulus clouds every day last week.
This passage tells you about the clouds Manuel saw last week. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The passage describes a specific observation made by Manuel about the sky filled with cumulus clouds every day last week. This indicates a temporary state of the atmosphere, aligning with the definition of weather, which pertains to the conditions at a specific time and place. In contrast, climate refers to the long-term patterns of weather in a region, which is not what is being conveyed in the passage. Therefore, the correct choice is weather."
	Which job does the circulatory system do?	['It breaks down food into small pieces.', 'It helps remove carbon dioxide waste from the body.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Animals	Body systems: circulation and respiration	"To stay alive, animal cells must get water and oxygen. Animal cells also produce carbon dioxide, a waste that must be removed. An animal's respiratory and circulatory systems work together to do these jobs.
An animal's respiratory system is made up of organs that work together to bring in oxygen gas from the environment. The respiratory system also removes carbon dioxide gas from the animal's body. Some animals have lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with the air. Other animals have gills to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide with water.
An animal's circulatory system is made up of organs that work together to move blood through its body. The heart pumps blood through blood vessels throughout the body. As blood moves through blood vessels, it delivers oxygen, nutrients from food, and water to cells. Blood also absorbs waste, including carbon dioxide. When the blood is pumped into the lungs or gills, it releases carbon dioxide and absorbs oxygen."	"The circulatory system brings oxygen, nutrients, and water to cells. It also helps remove carbon dioxide waste.
The circulatory system does not break down food into small pieces. This job is done by the digestive system. After the digestive system breaks down food, blood vessels in the intestines absorb the nutrients from the food. The blood then carries the nutrients to cells throughout the body."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The circulatory system is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, and water to cells while also aiding in the removal of carbon dioxide waste from the body. This aligns with choice (1), which states that it helps remove carbon dioxide waste. In contrast, choice (0) is incorrect because breaking down food into small pieces is the function of the digestive system, not the circulatory system. Thus, the correct answer is choice (1)."

naturally occurring"	yes or no	grade5	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Granodiorite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, granodiorite is not a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Granodiorite is classified as an igneous rock rather than a mineral. While it is naturally occurring and solid, it does not have a fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance, as it is composed of various minerals such as quartz, feldspar, and mica. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria necessary to be considered a mineral, leading to the conclusion that granodiorite is not a mineral."

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The scar on Reggie's left hand is a result of an injury or environmental factor, which means it is not something passed down genetically from parents. Inherited traits are those that are passed from parents to offspring through genes, such as eye color or hair type. Since scars are formed due to external circumstances, they are classified as acquired traits. Therefore, the correct choice is (0) acquired."

It makes eggs with no shells.
A gray tree frog has the traits of an amphibian. A gray tree frog is an amphibian."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the gray tree frog (1) because it possesses all the traits that define amphibians: it spends part of its life in water and part on land, has moist skin, and lays eggs without shells. In contrast, the African elephant (0) does not exhibit these traits and is classified as a mammal, lacking the key characteristics of amphibians.

Chroicocephalus ridibundus has the same scientific name as a black-headed gull. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Crocodylus moreletii does not have the same scientific name as a black-headed gull. So, Chroicocephalus ridibundus and Crocodylus moreletii are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The black-headed gull is scientifically named Chroicocephalus ridibundus, which corresponds directly to choice (0). This means that Chroicocephalus ridibundus is indeed the same species as the black-headed gull.

In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele F is for black fur, and the allele f is for brown fur.
Roxie, a Labrador retriever from this group, has black fur. Roxie has two alleles for black fur."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Roxie's observable version of the fur color trait is black fur. So, Roxie's phenotype for the fur color trait is black fur.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Roxie's phenotype for the fur color trait is determined by her observable characteristic, which is black fur. Since it is stated that Roxie has two alleles for black fur, it indicates that her genotype is homozygous dominant (FF). In this case, the phenotype is the visible expression of the genotype, which is black fur, aligning with the provided choices. Thus, the correct answer is that Roxie's phenotype is black fur."

A tokay gecko is a reptile. Like other reptiles, a tokay gecko is a vertebrate. It has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The giant wood wasp is selected as the invertebrate because it belongs to the class of insects, which are characterized as invertebrates. Invertebrates are organisms that do not have a backbone, and insects like the giant wood wasp possess an exoskeleton instead.

	Which basketball has a higher temperature?	['the basketball with more thermal energy', 'the basketball with less thermal energy']	0	Two basketballs are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two basketballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the basketball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The task presents two basketballs that are identical in all aspects except for their thermal energies. In thermodynamics, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, and a higher thermal energy indicates a greater average kinetic energy. Therefore, the basketball with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature, making option (0) the correct choice. This reasoning is based on the fundamental principles of heat and temperature in physics."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed.

"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The particles in sample B have both greater mass and higher average speed compared to those in sample A. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to both mass and the square of speed, the higher speed of the particles in sample B results in a significantly greater average kinetic energy. Consequently, since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, sample B must have the higher temperature."

Impatient has a negative connotation. It is not a nice word. An impatient person is often pushy and demanding."	A cozy house has a more positive connotation. A cozy house is small, but it is comfortable and warm.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The phrase ""a cozy house"" carries a more positive connotation because it implies warmth, comfort, and a welcoming atmosphere. While ""a small house"" simply describes the size without conveying any emotional or aesthetic appeal, ""cozy"" evokes feelings of safety and contentment. Thus, the term ""cozy"" enhances the overall perception of the house, making it seem more desirable."

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are positioned with the same poles facing one another. In magnetism, like poles (south-south or north-north) repel each other, causing them to push apart. Since the south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other, they will not attract but rather repel.

Kumal is a jaguar from this group. Kumal has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Kumal's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Kumal's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for a spotted coat. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Kumal's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (A) is dominant over the allele for a spotted coat (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Kumal's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Kumal's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a spotted coat."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Kumal has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene, which indicates that he possesses two recessive alleles. The recessive allele (a) corresponds to a spotted coat, while the dominant allele (A) corresponds to a black coat. Since Kumal does not have the dominant allele and only has recessive alleles, his phenotype must reflect the recessive trait, which is a spotted coat. Therefore, the correct answer is that Kumal has a spotted coat."

So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail.
To check this answer, consider whether Mer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive to the allele for a spotted tail (I). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Mer's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Mer's phenotype for the tail spots trait must be an unspotted tail."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Mer has a homozygous genotype of ii for the tail spots gene, which consists only of recessive alleles. The allele for an unspotted tail (i) is recessive, meaning that when an organism has two copies of this allele, it will display the recessive phenotype.

If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged.

SOLUTION: Gypsum is classified as a mineral because it possesses all the essential properties that define minerals. It is a pure substance with a fixed crystal structure, meaning it has a specific arrangement of atoms. Gypsum is naturally occurring and is not produced by biological processes, which further aligns it with the definition of a mineral.

SOLUTION: The crocodile egg fossil is located in a shallower layer of the sedimentary rock sequence compared to the feather fossil. In geology, the principle of superposition states that in an undisturbed sequence of sedimentary rocks, the layers at the bottom are older than those at the top.

['attract', 'repel']	1	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are positioned with like poles facing each other. In this case, the south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. According to the principles of magnetism, like poles (south-south or north-north) repel each other, while opposite poles (north-south) attract. Therefore, since both magnets have their south poles aligned, they will repel."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Rust forming on a bicycle frame is a chemical change. Oxygen in the air reacts with iron in the bicycle frame. The outside of the frame turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Grilling a hamburger is a chemical change. Heat from the grill causes the matter in the meat to change. Cooked meat and raw meat are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking a hamburger is caused by heating. But rust forming on a bicycle frame is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: Both changes involve chemical processes where the composition of the substances is altered. Rust formation is a chemical change that occurs due to the reaction of iron with oxygen, leading to rust, which is a different substance. Similarly, grilling a hamburger involves a chemical change as the heat alters the proteins and fats in the meat, resulting in cooked meat that has different properties from raw meat. Thus, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

['a liquid', 'a gas', 'a solid']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"The air inside a balloon is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a balloon expands to fill all the space in the balloon. If the balloon pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The air inside a balloon is classified as a gas because it has the ability to expand and fill the entire volume of the balloon. Unlike solids and liquids, gases do not have a fixed shape or volume; they take the shape of their container. When a balloon is filled with air, the gas molecules move freely and occupy all available space. This characteristic of gases is evident when the balloon pops, as the air quickly disperses into a larger area."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a test tube is 16 milliliters.
16 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: 16 milliliters  
SOLUTION: A test tube typically has a much smaller volume than 16 liters, which would be an impractically large amount for such a container. Test tubes are commonly used in laboratories for small-scale experiments and generally hold volumes ranging from a few milliliters to about 50 milliliters. Therefore, 16 milliliters is a more reasonable and accurate estimate for the volume of a test tube compared to 16 liters."

The second text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Elise may have been looking for an unusual name, but if she found it on a baby name website, it is not actually one of a kind.
Elise wanted her daughter to have a unique name, so she browsed baby name websites for months to find the perfect one.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word unique because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose option 0 because it uses the word ""unique"" in its traditional sense, referring to something that is one of a kind. The hand-knitted romper is described as unique because it was designed and made by Elise herself, emphasizing its singularity. In contrast, option 1 uses ""unique"" to imply that the name is interesting or unusual, which deviates from the traditional definition, as it suggests that the name could still be common or found on baby name websites.

In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a black coat, and the allele a is for a spotted coat.
Thor, a jaguar from this group, has a black coat. Thor has two alleles for a black coat."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Thor has two alleles for a black coat (A). So, Thor's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Thor's genotype for the coat pattern gene is represented by the combination of alleles he possesses. Since it is stated that he has a black coat and specifically that he has two alleles for a black coat, we can conclude that his genotype must be homozygous dominant (AA). The allele A signifies a black coat, and having two of these alleles confirms that his genotype is AA, which corresponds to the choice labeled as (1)."

It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.

SOLUTION: I chose answer (0) because the particles in sample B have both a higher mass and a higher average speed compared to those in sample A. According to the kinetic theory of gases, the average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the temperature of the gas. Since sample B's particles exhibit greater average kinetic energy, it indicates a higher temperature compared to sample A. Thus, sample B must be the one with the higher temperature."

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The first text message is more formal. It uses complete sentences, avoids slang (heads up), and uses the person's title (Ms. Wyatt). The other text message includes more casual language and sentence fragments.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first text message, ""Ms. Wyatt is already here. She's waiting in the lobby,"" is more formal because it uses a title to address the individual and employs complete sentences. In contrast, the second message, ""Heads up! Wyatt is here. In the lobby,"" utilizes casual language and fragments, which contribute to a more informal tone. The inclusion of ""Heads up!"" is particularly indicative of a conversational style rather than a formal communication.

Notice that each bird spent the same amount of time moving. The bird that moved 25 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bird must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The first bird moved 25 kilometers in 5 hours, resulting in a speed of 5 kilometers per hour (25 km ÷ 5 hr). The second bird moved 15 kilometers in the same time, resulting in a speed of 3 kilometers per hour (15 km ÷ 5 hr).

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs is true because the magnets in both pairs are made of the same material and are of the same size. The distance between the magnets in both pairs is also the same, which means that the factors affecting the magnitude of the magnetic force are consistent. Although the magnets in Pair 1 repel and those in Pair 2 attract, this only influences the direction of the force, not its magnitude. Therefore, the conclusion is that the magnetic force is equal in both pairs."

There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.

60 cups and 60 gallons are both too much."	"ANSWER: 60 fluid ounces  
SOLUTION: I chose 60 fluid ounces as the best estimate for the volume of a blender because it is a common measurement for kitchen appliances designed for food preparation. Most standard blenders typically have capacities ranging from around 32 to 64 ounces, making 60 fluid ounces a reasonable representation of a blender's volume. The other options, 60 cups and 60 gallons, are excessively large and not practical for typical blending tasks. Therefore, 60 fluid ounces is the most accurate choice."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Roasting a marshmallow is a chemical change. The type of matter on the outside of the marshmallow changes. As a marshmallow is roasted, it turns brown and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Roasting is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Both changes involve a transformation of substances at a molecular level, which classifies them as chemical changes. In the case of milk going sour, the lactose in the milk is converted into lactic acid, resulting in a change of taste and composition. Similarly, roasting a marshmallow involves the Maillard reaction and caramelization, leading to a change in color and flavor. Therefore, the commonality between these two changes is that they are both chemical changes."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 50°C pot of spaghetti sauce is colder than the 60°C pot of spaghetti sauce, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The pot of spaghetti sauce at 50°C has less thermal energy compared to the pot at 60°C because thermal energy is directly related to temperature.

Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Grandma Mia is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter should follow standard capitalization rules. In this case, ""Dear Grandma Mia,"" is the appropriate choice because it correctly capitalizes ""Mia,"" which is part of the proper noun ""Grandma Mia."" Additionally, it ends with a comma, adhering to the conventions of letter writing. The first option incorrectly uses lowercase 'm' in ""mia,"" making it grammatically incorrect."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that although the magnets in Pair 1 attract and those in Pair 2 repel, this does not impact the magnitude of the magnetic force, only its direction. Since Magnet B in Pair 1 is larger than Magnet B in Pair 2, and both pairs contain Magnet A of the same size, the larger size in Pair 1 leads to a greater magnetic force. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1."

Benedict Arnold alludes to the American general during the Revolutionary War who betrayed his country and fought for the British."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text employs an allusion by referencing Benedict Arnold, a historical figure known for his betrayal during the American Revolutionary War. This reference evokes the concept of betrayal without explicitly explaining it, relying on the reader's prior knowledge of Arnold's actions. The use of his name in this context suggests that Peter's actions are similarly treacherous, making the comparison clear and impactful. Thus, the correct choice is allusion, as it connects the text to a broader historical narrative."

Methane is the main component of natural gas, which is used in homes for heating and cooking.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"All substances are made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent chemical bonds. Notice how each ball is labeled with a symbol for a chemical element.

In this model, each ball is labeled with C for carbon or H for hydrogen. So, the model shows you that methane is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, methane is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Methane is composed of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, which indicates that it is made up of more than one chemical element. Since it contains two different elements bonded together, it qualifies as a compound rather than an elementary substance. Elementary substances consist of only one type of element, while methane's structure demonstrates the presence of both carbon and hydrogen, confirming it as a compound."

You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The statement that ""The magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2"" is true because the strength of the magnetic force is influenced by the distance between the magnets. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than those in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 is stronger. This conclusion is based on the principle that magnetic forces increase as the distance between magnets decreases. Therefore, the correct choice is that Pair 2 exhibits a stronger magnetic force."

Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.

The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses literally in its traditional sense: in a factual, non-exaggerated way.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian literally had to drink three glasses of milk to ease the pain.
The first text uses literally in its nontraditional sense: nearly or in effect (often exaggerated). Julian's mouth may be in pain, but it is not actually on fire.
The curry that the chef prepared was so spicy that Julian's mouth was literally on fire by the time he finished his meal.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second text uses ""literally"" in its traditional sense, indicating that Julian genuinely had to drink three glasses of milk to alleviate the spiciness of the curry. This conveys a factual statement without exaggeration. In contrast, the first text uses ""literally"" in a nontraditional and exaggerated way, suggesting that Julian's mouth was ""on fire,"" which is not something that can occur in a literal sense. This highlights a common misuse of the term ""literally"" in contemporary language."

The snowy owl has a short hooked beak. Its beak is not adapted to get nectar out of long flowers. The snowy owl uses its beak to tear through meat."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the violet sabrewing because, like the malachite sunbird, it has a long, thin beak that is specifically adapted to extract nectar from long flowers. The snowy owl, in contrast, has a short hooked beak that is not suited for this purpose, as it is designed for tearing through meat rather than accessing floral nectar.

If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Dolerite does not have all the properties of a mineral. So, dolerite is not a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Dolerite is classified as an igneous rock rather than a mineral. While it is found in nature and is solid, it does not meet the criteria of being a pure substance or having a fixed crystal structure, which are essential characteristics of minerals. Additionally, dolerite is composed of various minerals rather than being a single mineral itself. Therefore, the conclusion is that dolerite is not a mineral."

SOLUTION: The object in question is a spring, which is characterized by its ability to bend and compress without breaking, indicating that it is flexible. The definition of flexibility aligns with the properties of a spring, allowing it to retain its shape after being deformed. On the other hand, the property of being slippery does not apply to the spring, as it does not possess a surface that is difficult to grip. Therefore, the better answer is that the spring is flexible."

A million times is an exaggeration, since it is unlikely that Kayla has actually been told this a million times."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs hyperbole, which is an exaggerated statement not intended to be taken literally. The phrase ""a million times"" emphasizes the speaker's frustration and underscores the frequency of the request rather than providing a precise count. This exaggeration serves to convey emotion and intensity in the communication, making it clear that the speaker feels they have repeated themselves excessively.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force between magnets decreases as the distance between them increases. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than those in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is weaker. Therefore, the correct statement is that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2. This aligns with the principle that closer magnets exert a stronger force on each other."

SOLUTION: The phrase ""old news"" serves as an oxymoron because it juxtaposes the concept of something being ""old"" with the typical expectation of ""news"" being something recent or new. This contradiction highlights the idea that Jaylen's departure is no longer a surprise or a topic of current interest, as it has been anticipated for a long time.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

SOLUTION: The term ""big-boned"" is commonly used as a euphemism to describe someone who is overweight in a more socially acceptable way. In this context, it suggests that Will's size is not just a matter of bone structure but also implies that he carries extra weight. The phrase is intended to soften the perception of his body size, indicating that he may not fit the typical body image expected for someone in middle school.

The first sentence does not use abbreviated language, so it is more formal."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first sentence is more formal because it includes the abbreviation ""TBD"" (to be determined), which is commonly used in casual or less formal contexts. The use of abbreviations tends to make a statement sound more informal. In contrast, the second sentence is straightforward and uses clear language without abbreviations, making it less formal overall. Therefore, the first sentence is the more formal option."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The reasoning is based on the size comparison of the magnets in each pair. Since Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, it does not affect the comparison. However, Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1, which means that the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is indeed smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1, making option 2 the correct choice."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Sample B has particles that possess both greater mass and higher average speed compared to the particles in sample A. The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to their speed and mass. Therefore, since the particles in sample B exhibit higher average kinetic energy, it logically follows that sample B has a higher temperature than sample A. This conclusion aligns with the fundamental principles of thermodynamics, where temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance."

	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Jerry has five toes on each foot."	['inherited', 'acquired']	0	Hint: Jerry was born with five toes on each foot.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Most humans are born with five toes on each foot. So, having five toes is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The trait of having five toes on each foot is a characteristic that is typically determined by genetics and is present at birth. Since Jerry was born with five toes, this trait is inherited and not acquired through environmental factors or personal choices. Most humans share this trait, which further supports that it is inherited rather than learned or developed over time."

Since slippery is between the guide words shy - spool, it would be found on that page."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: To determine which word fits between the guide words ""shy"" and ""spool,"" we need to consider the alphabetical order of the options provided. The word ""slippery"" begins with ""sli,"" which comes after ""shy"" (which starts with ""sh"") and before ""spool"" (which starts with ""sp"").

Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
The Atacama Desert in Chile is one of the driest places on Earth. It has an average precipitation of only 1.5 centimeters per year.
This passage tells you about the usual precipitation in the Atacama Desert. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage provides information about the average precipitation in the Atacama Desert, which reflects the long-term weather patterns typical of the region. This indicates that it is discussing climate rather than specific weather conditions at a particular time. Since climate encompasses the average weather patterns over a longer period, the text aligns with the definition of climate. Therefore, the correct choice is climate, represented by the number 1."

"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnets will attract each other because they are oriented with opposite poles facing each other. In this case, the south pole of one magnet is adjacent to the north pole of the other. According to the fundamental properties of magnets, opposite poles attract while like poles repel. Therefore, since the poles are different, the magnets will pull towards each other, resulting in attraction."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	An icicle forming on the edge of a roof is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: An icicle forming on the edge of a roof represents a physical change because it involves the transition of water from a liquid state to a solid state without altering its chemical composition. The process of freezing does not create a new substance; rather, it changes the state of the existing water. Thus, since the matter remains the same (water), it is classified as a physical change rather than a chemical change."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

SOLUTION: I chose Solution A because it has more blue particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. By applying the concentration formula, which considers both the number of solute particles and the volume of the solvent, we can determine that Solution A's ratio of blue particles to solvent volume is higher. This indicates that Solution A is more concentrated in blue particles than Solution B. Hence, Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles."

SOLUTION: The common property among the three objects is that they are all salty. The analysis reveals that while the fries are flexible, the potato chips are not, which eliminates flexibility as a common property. Additionally, both the fries and potato chips are described as not being smooth. Thus, the only shared characteristic is their salty taste, leading to the conclusion that the answer is salty, corresponding to choice (0)."
	Based on this information, what is Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait?	['a reddish-brown coat', 'a black coat']	1	"In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Toriel is a horse from this group. Toriel has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Toriel's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Toriel's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Toriel's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Toriel's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Toriel's genotype is homozygous dominant (LL) for the coat color gene, where the dominant allele (L) corresponds to a black coat. Since the recessive allele (l) for a reddish-brown coat does not appear in the genotype, Toriel must express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele. Therefore, Toriel's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat, confirming the choice of option (1)."

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.

Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both a copper statue turning green and baking an apple pie are chemical changes. In the case of the copper statue, the chemical reaction between copper and oxygen leads to the formation of copper oxide, which changes the statue's color. Similarly, baking an apple pie involves chemical reactions that alter the composition of the ingredients, resulting in a different substance with new properties. Therefore, both changes result in the transformation of matter into a different chemical form."

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.

SOLUTION: The wood fossil is located in a deeper layer of the sedimentary rock sequence compared to the ginkgo leaf fossil. In geology, the principle of superposition states that in undisturbed sedimentary layers, older layers are found beneath younger layers. Since the wood fossil is positioned deeper, it is more likely to be older than the ginkgo leaf fossil, which is found in a higher, more recent layer."

When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun she could refer to Maria or Susan.
After Maria scolded Susan for missing the deadline, she felt awful.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Maria felt awful after she scolded Susan for missing the deadline."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose answer choice (0) because it contains a vague pronoun reference with the pronoun ""she."" It is unclear whether ""she"" refers to Maria or Susan, leading to potential confusion about who felt awful after the scolding. In contrast, answer choice (1) clarifies the subject by directly stating that Maria felt awful, thus eliminating any ambiguity regarding the pronoun reference. This demonstrates how rephrasing can enhance clarity in writing."

['concrete', 'metal']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Materials	Identify multiple materials in objects	"A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
Some objects are made of just one material.
Most nails are made of metal.
Other objects are made of more than one material.
This hammer is made of metal and wood."	"Look at the picture of the coat.
The coat is made of two materials. The buckle is made of metal. The rest of the coat is made of wool.
Wool comes from the fluffy coats of sheep! First, a farmer cuts the sheep's coats. Then, the wool is spun into yarn. The yarn can be dyed and used to make clothes."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Although the coat is primarily made of wool, the question specifically asks which material is the coat made of from the given choices. Since the options provided are concrete and metal, and the text indicates that the buckle is made of metal, the correct answer based on the closed choice options is (1) metal. The wool itself is not one of the choices, thus making metal the most relevant answer despite it being just a component of the coat."
	"Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
From across the room, Uncle Ronald's laughter was booming thunder."	['simile', 'metaphor']	1		closed choice	grade5	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"From across the room, Uncle Ronald's laughter was booming thunder.
The words laughter and thunder are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence compares Uncle Ronald's laughter to booming thunder without using the words ""like"" or ""as,"" which are typical indicators of a simile. Instead, it states that his laughter ""was"" booming thunder, directly equating the two. This direct comparison is characteristic of a metaphor, as it conveys the intensity and volume of his laughter by likening it to the loudness of thunder. Thus, the appropriate choice is a metaphor."
	Select the liquid.	['ballet shoes', 'hammer', 'wet paint', 'ring']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A ring is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A ring keeps its shape, even when you take it off your finger.
A ballet shoe is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When a dancer wears a ballet shoe, it may bend a little. But the ballet shoe still has a size and shape of its own.
A hammer is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A hammer is made of iron and wood. Both iron and wood are solids.
Wet paint is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour wet paint out of a can, the paint will change shape. But the wet paint will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Wet paint is classified as a liquid because it takes the shape of its container and can flow, which are defining characteristics of liquids. In contrast, ballet shoes, hammers, and rings are all solids, which maintain a fixed shape and volume. The explanation provided illustrates how wet paint behaves differently from the other options, confirming it as the correct choice for the liquid."
	"What does the verbal irony in this text suggest?
""That fits you well,"" Bobby remarked after Paula's cap fell over her eyes for the tenth time."	['The cap was a good fit.', 'The cap was too big.']	1		closed choice	grade8	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Interpret figures of speech	"Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
Verbal irony involves saying one thing but implying something very different. People often use verbal irony when they are being sarcastic.

Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Fits you well ironically suggests that the cap was too big. The cap was falling over Paula's eyes, so it didn't fit her well at all."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The verbal irony in Bobby's remark ""That fits you well"" implies that the cap is, in fact, too big for Paula since it repeatedly falls over her eyes. Instead of genuinely complimenting the fit of the cap, Bobby's comment highlights the absurdity of the situation, as the cap clearly does not serve its intended purpose. This contrast between the literal statement and the actual situation creates the irony that suggests the opposite of what is being said. Therefore, the correct choice is that the cap was too big."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
mixing sand and water"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	1		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Mixing sand and water is a physical change. Adding water makes the sand wet. But both the sand and water are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both erosion caused by wind and mixing sand and water are classified as physical changes. In both cases, the original materials retain their chemical properties and identity; erosion simply relocates the particles without altering them, while mixing sand and water does not create a new substance. Therefore, the most accurate choice is that both changes are only physical changes. The other options related to heating or cooling do not apply to these processes."

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Ecosystems	Interpret food webs I	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a secondary consumer, so the copepod is a tertiary consumer.
The rotifer has arrows pointing to it from the green algae and the water flea. Neither the green algae nor the water flea is a secondary consumer, so the rotifer is not a tertiary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the rotifer and the shiner. The rotifer and the shiner are secondary consumers, so the black crappie is a tertiary consumer.
The green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a tertiary consumer."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The copepod is identified as the tertiary consumer because it receives arrows from the secondary consumer, the rotifer. In the food web hierarchy, tertiary consumers consume secondary consumers, which is the case here. The other options, the rotifer and green algae, do not fit the definition of tertiary consumers; the rotifer is a secondary consumer, and the green algae is a producer with no arrows pointing to it. Therefore, the correct answer is the copepod."

Megabats are large-bodied bats that eat fruit, including figs.
When a megabat eats a fig, it may also swallow the seeds inside the fig. The bat gets energy from the fruit but cannot digest the seeds. The seeds pass through the bat's digestive system and are disposed of in its feces.
The bat often drops the seeds far from the fig tree that produced the fruit. When a seed germinates, or begins to grow, in a new location, it doesn't need to compete with its parent tree for resources. So, both the fig seed and the parent tree have a better chance of surviving.
Figure: a megabat carrying a fig away from a fig tree."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Ecological interactions	Classify symbiotic relationships	"When two organisms of different species interact in a way that affects one or both organisms, they form a symbiotic relationship. The word symbiosis comes from a Greek word that means living together. Scientists define types of symbiotic relationships based on how each organism is affected.
This table lists three common types of symbiotic relationships. It shows how each organism is affected in each type of symbiotic relationship.
Type of symbiotic relationship | Organism of one species... | Organism of the other species...
Commensal | benefits | is not significantly affected
Mutualistic | benefits | benefits
Parasitic | benefits | is harmed (but not usually killed)"	"When a megabat eats a fig, the megabat gets the food it needs to survive and grow. So the megabat benefits from its relationship with the fig tree.
Both the fig tree and its seeds have a better chance of surviving when the bat moves the seeds to a new location. So, the fig tree also benefits from its relationship with the megabat.
Since both the megabat and the fig tree benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds in a new location."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The relationship formed when a megabat eats a fig and drops the fig tree's seeds is mutualistic because both the megabat and the fig tree benefit from the interaction. The megabat gains energy from the fig fruit, while the fig tree benefits from the dispersal of its seeds to a new location, enhancing the chances of survival for both the seeds and the parent tree. This mutual benefit characterizes mutualistic relationships, as opposed to parasitic or commensal relationships where only one party benefits or where one party benefits without affecting the other."

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	Stapling an envelope shut is a physical change. The envelope and the staple get new shapes. Both are still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0

Its scientific name is Pelecanus rufescens.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Classification and scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A pink-backed pelican's scientific name is Pelecanus rufescens.
Pelecanus rufescens has the same scientific name as a pink-backed pelican. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Strix uralensis does not have the same scientific name as a pink-backed pelican. So, Pelecanus rufescens and Strix uralensis are not in the same species.
Ardea cinerea does not have the same scientific name as a pink-backed pelican. So, Pelecanus rufescens and Ardea cinerea are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The pink-backed pelican is scientifically known as Pelecanus rufescens. Since the task requires selecting the organism that belongs to the same species as the pink-backed pelican, the correct choice is option (1) Pelecanus rufescens. The other options, Strix uralensis and Ardea cinerea, have different scientific names and therefore do not belong to the same species as the pink-backed pelican. Thus, the only correct answer is the option that matches the scientific name of the pink-backed pelican."

SOLUTION: The sentence ""We will camp for two nights"" clearly indicates a future action due to the use of ""will,"" which indicates intention or a plan that has not yet occurred. The main verb ""camp"" follows ""will,"" confirming that the action is anticipated to take place in the future. Thus, the tense of the sentence is classified as future tense."

The eggs, oil, and vinegar look different when they are mixed together. But, their molecules do not change.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Mixing eggs, oil, and vinegar to make mayonnaise is classified as a physical change because it results in a mixture rather than a chemical transformation of the substances involved. The ingredients retain their individual properties, and no new substances are formed during the process. While the appearance and texture of the mixture change, the molecules of the ingredients do not undergo any chemical alteration, confirming that it remains a physical change."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The distance between magnets significantly influences the strength of the magnetic force they exert on each other. In this case, since the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is greater than that in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 will naturally be weaker. Thus, the correct statement is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2. This reasoning aligns with the principle that increased distance results in a diminished magnetic force."
	Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Milford. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Milford?	['The supply probably went down.', 'The supply probably went up.']	0		closed choice	grade3	social science	economics	Supply and demand	Understand overall supply and demand	"Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand

Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The problem states that there were seven men's clothing stores last year and only three this year, indicating a decrease in the number of suppliers. With fewer stores available to sell men's shirts, it is likely that the overall supply of men's shirts in Milford has decreased. This reduction in the number of stores directly correlates with a lower availability of products, leading to the conclusion that the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

The gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth () as Emmett rode up the hill."	['decreased', 'increased', 'stayed the same']	1	"Read the text about an object in motion.
Emmett rode his motorcycle from the bottom of a hill to the top of the hill."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Kinetic and potential energy	Identify changes in gravitational potential energy	"Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth changed.
The top of the hill is higher than the bottom of the hill. As Emmett rode toward the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of Earth increased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the motorcycle and Earth increased as Emmett rode up the hill."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: As Emmett rode his motorcycle from the bottom to the top of the hill, the distance between the motorcycle and the center of the Earth increased because the top of the hill is at a higher elevation than the bottom. Gravitational potential energy is directly related to the height of an object above the Earth's surface; therefore, as the height increases, the gravitational potential energy also increases. Since the mass of the motorcycle remained constant, the increase in height leads to an increase in gravitational potential energy. Thus, the correct answer is that the gravitational potential energy increased."

If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a white body or a brown body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a white body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a brown body.
A white body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a white body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A brown body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A Channel catfish with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a brown body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a white body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a brown body."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with a white body to offspring with a brown body is determined by the genotypes produced in the Punnett square. Since the allele for a white body (b) is recessive, it requires two recessive alleles (bb) to express that phenotype, while a brown body can be represented by either the homozygous dominant (BB) or heterozygous (Bb) genotypes. As indicated in the analysis, the Punnett square reveals that no offspring will have the genotype bb, confirming that the ratio of white to brown bodies is 0:4. Therefore, the most likely ratio is 0:4, indicating that all offspring will have a brown body."

Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses personification, giving human characteristics to nonhuman things.
Edgar's '64 Impala groaned describes the car as if it were human."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs personification, as it attributes human-like qualities to Edgar's '64 Impala by stating that it ""groaned"" when the ignition was turned. This expression suggests that the car is capable of experiencing feelings or sounds typically associated with living beings, thereby enhancing the emotional resonance of the narrative. In contrast, a metaphor would require a direct comparison between two unlike things without using ""like"" or ""as,"" which is not present in this text. Thus, personification is the correct figure of speech used here."

Wayne has naturally dark skin."	['acquired', 'inherited']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Wayne's skin color is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Skin color is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to their children. Since Wayne has naturally dark skin, it indicates that he has inherited this trait from his ancestors rather than acquiring it through environmental influences or personal choices. This aligns with the understanding of hereditary traits, which are based on genetics and not on experiences or actions. Thus, Wayne's dark skin is classified as an inherited trait."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	A pair of jeans is a solid. You can fold a pair of jeans. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: A pair of jeans is classified as a solid because it has a definite shape and volume. Unlike liquids and gases, solids maintain their form and do not conform to the shape of their container. Jeans can be folded and they retain their structure, further demonstrating their solid nature. Thus, the correct choice is (2) a solid."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. They has been replaced with the servers.
At lunchtime, Steven can often be found reading at his favorite café, where the servers provide unlimited coffee refills."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""they"" does not have a clear antecedent. It is unclear whether ""they"" refers to the café or the servers, which can lead to confusion. In contrast, the first answer choice clarifies this by explicitly mentioning ""the servers,"" thereby eliminating the ambiguity associated with the pronoun.

	Compare the motion of two beluga whales. Which beluga whale was moving at a lower speed?	['a beluga whale that moved 30kilometers in 5hours', 'a beluga whale that moved 20kilometers in 5hours']	1		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each beluga whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One beluga whale moved 20 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other beluga whale moved 30 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each beluga whale spent the same amount of time moving. The beluga whale that moved 20 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that beluga whale must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which beluga whale was moving at a lower speed, we can calculate their speeds using the formula speed = distance/time. The first beluga whale covered 30 kilometers in 5 hours, resulting in a speed of 6 kilometers per hour. The second beluga whale covered 20 kilometers in the same 5 hours, resulting in a speed of 4 kilometers per hour. Since 4 kilometers per hour is less than 6 kilometers per hour, the beluga whale that moved 20 kilometers was moving at a lower speed."
	Select the one substance that is not a mineral.	['Quartz is not made by living things. It is a pure substance.', 'Pyrite is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.', 'Plastic is not a pure substance. It is made in a factory.']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"

Quartz is a mineral.
Plastic is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
Plastic is made in a factory. But all minerals are formed in nature.
So, plastic is not a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Plastic is not a mineral because it is not a pure substance and is manufactured in a factory, whereas all minerals are defined as naturally occurring and pure substances. In contrast, both quartz and pyrite are naturally occurring and meet the criteria for being classified as minerals. Therefore, the properties of plastic do not match those of minerals, leading to the conclusion that plastic is the substance that is not a mineral."

['the Indian Ocean', 'the Arctic Ocean', 'the Pacific Ocean']	1		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects the Arctic Ocean. It does not intersect the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The prime meridian, which is defined as 0° longitude, primarily runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It intersects the Arctic Ocean as it passes through northern regions before continuing through landmasses like Europe and Africa. The Pacific Ocean is located to the west of the prime meridian, while the Indian Ocean is situated to the south and southeast, making them both non-intersecting with the prime meridian. Thus, the correct choice is the Arctic Ocean, represented by the number 1."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	All three cherry pies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 87°F pie is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The object with the most thermal energy among the three cherry pies is the one at a temperature of 87°F, which corresponds to choice (2). Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; as the temperature increases, the thermal energy also increases if the mass remains constant. Since all the pies are identical in mass and only differ in temperature, the pie with the highest temperature has the most thermal energy. Thus, the cherry pie at 87°F is the correct answer."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18

Then compare the result to the volume of Earth. The volume of Earth is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, which is greater than 6.08 x 10^11 km^3. So, the volume of Earth is more than ten times the volume of Mercury."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The statement is true because the volume of Earth is indeed more than ten times the volume of Mercury. The volume of Mercury is approximately 6.08 x 10^11 km^3, and when you multiply this by ten, you get about 6.08 x 10^12 km^3. The volume of Earth, which is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3, exceeds this value, confirming that Earth's volume is greater than ten times that of Mercury. Thus, the statement is verified as true."

['a solid', 'a liquid']	0		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid or liquid	"Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid."	A rubber duck is a solid. You can squeeze a rubber duck. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A rubber duck is classified as a solid because it maintains a definite shape and volume. Although it can be squeezed, this property is characteristic of many solids, particularly those made from materials like rubber that can be flexible but still retain their form. Liquids, on the other hand, do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of their container. Therefore, the correct choice is that a rubber duck is a solid."

What made Sally so upset?"	['imperative', 'interrogative']	1		closed choice	grade5	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement. It tells about something. A declarative sentence always ends with a period.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
An interrogative sentence is a question. It asks something. An interrogative sentence always ends with a question mark.
How tall are you?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something. An imperative sentence usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.
Read the first chapter by next week.

SOLUTION: The sentence ""What made Sally so upset?"" is structured to ask for information, which is characteristic of interrogative sentences. It is punctuated with a question mark, further indicating that it is seeking a response or clarification. In contrast, imperative sentences typically give commands or requests and do not end with a question mark. Therefore, this sentence clearly fits the definition of an interrogative sentence."

A certain cucumber plant from this group has bumpy fruit. This plant has one allele for bumpy fruit and one allele for smooth fruit."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The cucumber plant has one allele for bumpy fruit (F) and one allele for smooth fruit (f). So, the plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is Ff.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The cucumber plant has bumpy fruit, which indicates the presence of the dominant allele F. According to the information provided, this plant possesses one allele for bumpy fruit (F) and one allele for smooth fruit (f). Therefore, its genotype is a combination of these alleles, which is represented as Ff. The choice (0) corresponds to the genotype Ff, confirming it as the correct answer."

['wood', 'mammal tooth']	1	This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Fossils	Compare ages of fossils in a rock sequence	"A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The mammal tooth fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the wood fossil. So, the mammal tooth fossil is most likely younger than the wood fossil."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: In sedimentary rock layers, the principle of superposition states that in an undisturbed sequence, the oldest layers are at the bottom, and the younger layers are at the top. In this case, the mammal tooth fossil is found in a shallower layer compared to the wood fossil, indicating that it was deposited more recently. Therefore, since it is positioned higher in the rock sequence, the mammal tooth fossil is considered younger than the wood fossil."

"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Sample A has particles with both greater mass and higher average speed compared to those in sample B. Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and the square of the speed of the particles, which means that the particles in sample A possess a greater average kinetic energy. Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, the higher average kinetic energy in sample A indicates that it has a higher temperature than sample B."

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are positioned such that the south pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other magnet. According to the principles of magnetism, like poles repel each other, meaning that two south poles will push away from one another. Therefore, the correct choice is to indicate that these magnets will repel."

Napoleon Bonaparte was a better leader than King Louis XVI.
The statement above is an opinion. People can have different ideas about what makes someone a ""better"" leader, so the statement cannot be proved."	"The first sentence states a fact.

Attractive shows what a person believes, thinks, or feels. Another person might have a different opinion about which plants make home gardens attractive."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second sentence states a fact because it describes a specific role that certain insects play in the reproduction of flowering plants, which can be verified through scientific literature on pollination. In contrast, the first sentence expresses a subjective opinion about the aesthetics of tomato plants in gardens, as the term ""attractive"" is inherently subjective and can vary from person to person.

Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The comparison of average kinetic energies between the two samples indicates that while both samples have the same average speed, the particles in sample A possess greater mass. Since kinetic energy is dependent on both mass and velocity (KE = 0.5 * m * v²), the higher mass of the particles in sample A results in a greater average kinetic energy compared to those in sample B. Consequently, this higher average kinetic energy implies that sample A exhibits a higher temperature than sample B."

['a mature fern', 'a heart-shaped plant']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	"A heart-shaped plant can produce eggs and sperm.
A mature fern produces spores, not eggs and sperm."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question asks which plant can produce eggs and sperm. A heart-shaped plant, which refers to the gametophyte stage of ferns, is capable of producing both eggs and sperm for reproduction. In contrast, a mature fern produces spores, which are a different reproductive structure and do not directly involve the production of eggs and sperm. Thus, the correct answer is the heart-shaped plant, as it is associated with the sexual reproduction phase in the life cycle of ferns."

A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.

There are many different types of terrestrial, or land-based, ecosystems. Here are some ways in which terrestrial ecosystems can differ from each other:
the pattern of weather, or climate
the type of soil
the organisms that live there"	A tundra is a type of ecosystem. Tundras have the following features: long, cold winters and short, cold summers, soil that is frozen year-round, and mostly small plants. So, Peary Land has mostly small plants. It also has short, cool summers.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Peary Land is characterized as a tundra ecosystem, which typically features long, cold winters and short, cold summers. The vegetation found in tundras consists mainly of small plants due to the harsh climatic conditions and permafrost, which limits root growth. Therefore, the description that Peary Land has mostly small plants and short, cool summers accurately reflects its ecosystem. In contrast, the other option mentioning warm summers does not align with the characteristics of a tundra."

['the flowers', 'the fruit']	0	This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Angiosperm and conifer life cycles	"Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again."	"An apple tree's flowers can make seeds. Inside a flower, a sperm cell and an egg fuse to make a fertilized egg. The fertilized egg grows into a seed.
The fruit grows from the ovary around the seeds. But the fruit does not make the seeds."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The flowers of an apple tree are responsible for making seeds, as they contain the reproductive structures necessary for fertilization. Inside the flowers, sperm cells from pollen fertilize the eggs, leading to the formation of seeds. The fruit, which develops from the ovary of the flower, serves to protect and disperse the seeds but does not produce them. Therefore, the correct answer is that the flowers can make seeds, not the fruit."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.

A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a caterpillar is 38 millimeters.
38 centimeters, 38 meters, and 38 kilometers are all too long."	"ANSWER: 38 millimeters  
SOLUTION: I chose 38 millimeters because this measurement is the most reasonable estimate for the length of a caterpillar. Caterpillars typically range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in length, making 38 millimeters a plausible size. The other options, such as 38 centimeters, 38 meters, and 38 kilometers, are significantly larger than what is commonly observed for caterpillars, and therefore not suitable estimates."
	Based on this information, what is Bianca's genotype for the eye color gene?	['brown eyes', 'EE']	1	"In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for brown eyes, and the allele e is for red eyes.
Bianca, a guinea pig from this group, has brown eyes. Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Bianca has two alleles for brown eyes (E). So, Bianca's genotype for the eye color gene is EE.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Bianca has brown eyes, which indicates she possesses the dominant allele for eye color, represented by the letter E. Since it is stated that she has two alleles for brown eyes, this confirms that her genotype must be homozygous dominant, or EE. The presence of two E alleles means that there are no recessive alleles (e) present, thereby making EE the correct representation of her genotype."

Figure: Eurasian lynx."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: beaks, mouths, and necks	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the Eurasian lynx.
The Eurasian lynx has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat. The Eurasian lynx uses its large mouth to grab its prey. It uses its sharp teeth to cut up the meat of the prey into pieces it can swallow.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The marmot has large front teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The marmot uses its mouth to gnaw on plant matter."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The tiger is the correct choice because it is a carnivore with a mouth specifically adapted for tearing through meat, featuring large, sharp teeth that allow it to effectively capture and consume prey. In contrast, the marmot primarily uses its large front teeth to gnaw on plant matter and lacks the necessary adaptations for a meat-based diet. The comparison emphasizes that only the tiger shares the adaptation needed for tearing meat, which aligns with the characteristics of the Eurasian lynx mentioned in the text."

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Ecological interactions	Interpret food webs II	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the bat star.
The only arrow pointing from the sea otter leads to the orca. The only arrow pointing from the orca leads to the sea cucumber. No arrows point from the sea cucumber to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the sea otter to the bat star.There are three paths matter can take from the zooplankton to the bat star: zooplankton->kelp bass->bat star. zooplankton->plainfin midshipman->kelp bass->bat star. zooplankton->black rockfish->kelp bass->bat star. There is one path matter can take from the kelp to the bat star: kelp->kelp bass->bat star. orca. The only arrow pointing from the orca leads to the sea cucumber. No arrows point from the sea cucumber to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the orca to the bat star.."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The only organism that contains matter that eventually moves to the bat star is the kelp. There are multiple paths illustrated in the food web that show how matter moves from zooplankton to the kelp bass and ultimately to the bat star, as well as a direct path from kelp to kelp bass to bat star. The sea otter and orca do not have any pathways that lead to the bat star, as their matter only moves to other organisms that do not connect to the bat star. Therefore, the correct answer is kelp, which is represented by the choice (0)."

Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word factoid because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second text employs the word ""factoid"" in its traditional sense, which refers to a false or misleading statement presented as a fact. It indicates that the sci-fi movies misrepresent genetic concepts by including these misleading factoids. In contrast, the first text uses ""factoid"" to describe trivial but accurate pieces of information, which reflects a more modern, nontraditional usage of the term. Thus, the second text aligns with the standard definition of ""factoid"" as something that is fabricated yet presented as factual."

The hickory tree will use up more space than the carnations would have used up."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the cost involved in planting the hickory tree relates to the space it occupies, which impacts Henry's ability to use that space for other enjoyable activities. While the beauty of the hickory tree is a benefit, the fact that it will use more space than the carnations represents a trade-off, making it a cost in terms of functionality and available area in his backyard.

	Which soccer ball has less thermal energy?	['the colder soccer ball', 'the hotter soccer ball']	0	Two soccer balls are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy."	The two soccer balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder soccer ball has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature; the higher the temperature, the greater the thermal energy. Since the two soccer balls are identical in material and mass, the one with the lower temperature, which is the colder soccer ball, will have less thermal energy. Therefore, the colder soccer ball is the correct choice as it possesses less thermal energy compared to the hotter soccer ball."

SOLUTION: I chose the horned viper because it has sand-colored scales that allow it to blend into its sandy desert environment, making it well-adapted for camouflage. In contrast, the kingsnake has distinctive red, black, and yellow rings that do not provide effective camouflage in a desert setting. The ability to blend in with the surroundings is crucial for avoiding predators and enhancing hunting success, which the horned viper achieves through its coloration.

It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase more obedient. It describes the clay as if it were a person who can choose to obey or disobey.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""more obedient"" because it personifies the clay by attributing it with the ability to obey, which is a characteristic typically associated with sentient beings rather than inanimate objects. The idea that clay could choose to be more or less obedient suggests that the sculptor sees it as having agency in the creative process. This use of personification enhances the emotional connection between the artist and her medium, emphasizing the sculptor's desire for a more cooperative and responsive material as she works."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
crushing a mineral into powder
knitting yarn into a scarf"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Knitting yarn into a scarf is a physical change. The yarn gets a different shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both changes described—crushing a mineral into powder and knitting yarn into a scarf—are physical changes. In both cases, the original materials remain the same at a molecular level; they have merely been altered in form or shape. There is no creation of new substances, which is a hallmark of chemical changes. Therefore, the correct choice is that both are only physical changes."

Houston is a city near the coast of Texas. On average, Houston receives about 49 inches of rain each year.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the usual pattern of precipitation in Houston. This passage does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage provides information about the average annual rainfall in Houston, which indicates a long-term pattern rather than specific conditions at a particular time. This aligns with the definition of climate, which refers to the typical weather patterns observed over a longer period in a specific area. The mention of the average rainfall is a clear indicator of climate, rather than a description of daily weather variations."
	Which pencil has a lower temperature?	['the pencil with more thermal energy', 'the pencil with less thermal energy']	1	Two pencils are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two pencils are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the pencil with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question revolves around the relationship between thermal energy and temperature. Since both pencils are identical in material and mass, the pencil with less thermal energy will have a lower temperature. This is because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance; thus, with fewer thermal energy resources, the particles in that pencil will move less vigorously, resulting in a lower temperature."

Ammonia is ()."	['a compound', 'an elementary substance']	0	Most of the ammonia produced every year is used by farmers to help crops grow. The chemical formula for ammonia is NH3.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether ammonia is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for ammonia is NH3. This formula contains two symbols: N for nitrogen and H for hydrogen. So, the formula tells you that ammonia is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, ammonia is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Ammonia is classified as a compound because its chemical formula, NH3, consists of two different elements: nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H). The presence of more than one type of element bonded together indicates that it is a compound, as opposed to an elementary substance which would consist of only one type of element. In this case, since ammonia is made up of nitrogen and hydrogen, it clearly fits the definition of a compound."

Lola will give up the chance to go on the flying bobsled. She would have had more fun on that ride."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because it clearly identifies the opportunity cost of Lola's decision to go on the scorpion ride instead of the flying bobsled. By opting for the scorpion, she forfeits the opportunity to experience what she perceives as more fun on the flying bobsled. This trade-off highlights the concept of cost in decision-making, where choosing one option inherently means giving up another that may have been more enjoyable for her. Therefore, the loss of the chance to ride the flying bobsled signifies a cost associated with her choice."

The allele for white wool (L) is dominant over the allele for black wool (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black wool or white wool, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for white wool, is dominant over the l allele, which is for black wool.
Black wool is the recessive allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the wool color trait must have only recessive alleles for the wool color gene. So, offspring with black wool must have the genotype ll.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ll.
White wool is the dominant allele's version of the wool color trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the wool color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wool color gene. So, offspring with white wool must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with black wool. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with white wool."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with black wool to offspring with white wool is 4:0, indicating that all offspring will have black wool. In this scenario, the cross between two sheep results in all offspring having the genotype ll, which corresponds to black wool, as the allele for white wool (L) is dominant and requires at least one dominant allele to express white wool. Therefore, there are no expected offspring with white wool, leading to the conclusion that the ratio is entirely in favor of black wool, hence the answer is 4:0."

SOLUTION: The task requires identifying a common property shared by two objects, where one option is ""bouncy"" and the other is ""soft."" Upon examining the definitions, a soft object can change shape when squeezed, which applies to both objects in question.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

SOLUTION: I chose Solution B because it has a higher concentration of blue particles when comparing the number of blue particles to the volume of solvent in each solution. The concentration formula, which calculates the number of solute particles per unit volume, indicates that Solution B contains more blue particles per milliliter than Solution A. Therefore, the greater density of blue particles in Solution B confirms that it has a higher concentration of blue particles compared to Solution A."

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom.

	Which kind of place usually has quieter neighborhoods?	['an urban area', 'a suburban area']	1		closed choice	grade2	social science	geography	Geography	Compare urban, suburban, and rural areas	"People around the world live in three main kinds of places: urban areas, suburban areas, and rural areas.
An urban area is a city. It has many people and businesses. The buildings are close to each other. The buildings are often tall and have many floors. Since there are so many people, traffic is usually bad. People will walk or take the bus, train, or subway to avoid traffic.
A suburban area, or suburb, is near a city. It is quieter and less crowded than an urban area. People usually live in houses with yards. Most people drive to get places.
A rural area is less crowded than both urban and suburban areas. Houses are much more spread out. People usually have to drive to get places. People in rural areas often live on farms or ranches.
Some places, like small towns, don't really fit into any of the types. A small town does not have as many people as an urban area, but it has more people than a rural area. It is not near a city, so it is not called a suburb."	Suburban areas usually have quieter neighborhoods. There are fewer people, and houses are farther apart.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Suburban areas typically feature quieter neighborhoods compared to urban areas. This is primarily due to the lower population density, which means fewer people living in close proximity and less noise from traffic and commercial activities. Additionally, suburban neighborhoods often have more green spaces and residential homes with yards, contributing to a more peaceful environment.

SOLUTION: Both changes, crushing a mineral into powder and pouring milk on oatmeal, are classified as physical changes rather than chemical changes. In both cases, the original substances retain their chemical properties, and no new substances are formed. The process of crushing simply alters the physical form of the mineral, while mixing milk with oatmeal creates a mixture without changing the chemical structure of either component. Thus, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two rocks have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 95°F rock is hotter than the 20°F rock, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The task compares two identical rocks in terms of their thermal energy, which is directly related to their temperatures. The rock at 95°F has a higher temperature than the rock at 20°F, meaning it possesses more thermal energy. Since thermal energy increases with temperature for objects of the same mass, the 750-gram rock at 95°F is the one with more thermal energy. Thus, the correct choice is (0)."
	Which drop of honey has more thermal energy?	['the hotter drop of honey', 'the colder drop of honey']	0	Two drops of honey are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two drops of honey are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter drop of honey has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The hotter drop of honey has more thermal energy because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Since both drops are identical in mass and composition, the increase in temperature of the hotter drop results in a higher average kinetic energy of its molecules compared to the colder drop. Thus, the hotter drop contains more thermal energy overall."

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	"Humans do not choose their natural hair color. Some people dye their hair. But this does not change their natural hair color.
Children get their natural hair color from their parents. So, Cara's hair color is an inherited trait."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The trait of hair color is determined genetically and passed down from parents to children, making it an inherited characteristic. Since Cara has naturally brown hair, it indicates that this trait has been inherited rather than acquired through external means, such as dyeing. Acquired traits are those that result from environmental influences or personal choices, which do not apply in this case. Therefore, the correct classification for Cara's hair color is inherited."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: I chose answer 2 because the problem states that each particle in sample A has more mass and a higher average speed than those in sample B. Since kinetic energy is directly proportional to mass and the square of the speed of the particles, the particles in sample A possess a higher average kinetic energy. Consequently, since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, it follows that sample A has a higher temperature than sample B."

In this model, each ball is labeled with C for carbon or H for hydrogen. So, the model shows you that propane is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, propane is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Propane is classified as a compound because it is composed of two different chemical elements: carbon (C) and hydrogen (H). In the case of propane, its molecular formula is C3H8, indicating that it consists of three carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms bonded together. This confirms that propane is not an elementary substance, which would consist of only one type of element. Therefore, the correct choice is that propane is a compound."

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that the magnets in Pair 1 attract each other while those in Pair 2 repel each other. However, the key factor affecting the magnitude of the magnetic force is the size of the magnets. Since Magnet B in Pair 2 is larger than Magnet B in Pair 1, this results in a greater magnetic force in Pair 2.

Earth's gravity is pulling down on Hakim with a force of 400N. The diving board is pushing up on Hakim with a force of 400N.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Hakim, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Hakim down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Hakim up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Hakim."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The forces acting on Hakim consist of Earth's gravity pulling him down with a force of 400 N and the diving board pushing him up with an equal force of 400 N. Since these forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, they cancel each other out, resulting in a balanced state. Therefore, there is no net force acting on Hakim, which corresponds to choice (1)."

A school bus carrying 600 pounds is heavier than a school bus carrying 500 pounds. So, the school bus carrying 600 pounds needs a larger force to come to a stop in the same amount of time as the other bus."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The school bus carrying 600 pounds is heavier than the one carrying 500 pounds. According to Newton's second law of motion, force is equal to mass times acceleration (F = ma). Since both buses are traveling at the same speed and need to stop in the same amount of time, the heavier bus (600 pounds) requires a larger force to achieve that stop compared to the lighter bus (500 pounds). Thus, the bus carrying 600 pounds needs a larger force to come to a stop."

Sage has the homozygous genotype FF for the fleece type gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Sage's genotype for the fleece type gene is FF. Sage's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for a hairy fleece. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece.
To check this answer, consider whether Sage's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Sage's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait must be a hairy fleece."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Sage's genotype is homozygous FF, meaning it has two dominant alleles for the fleece type trait. The dominant allele (F) corresponds to a hairy fleece, while the recessive allele (f) corresponds to a woolly fleece. Since Sage has no recessive alleles, it will express the dominant phenotype, which is a hairy fleece. Therefore, based on the given information, Sage's phenotype for the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Job is the Bible.
In the Bible, Job remains faithful and loyal to God, even after the unjust loss of his possessions, family, and health.
The allusion Job means someone who patiently endures adversity."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""Job"" refers to a character from the Bible, specifically the Book of Job, which tells the story of a man who endures immense suffering while maintaining his faith in God. This connection indicates that Tucker is seen as someone who perseveres through difficulties, similar to Job's experience. The phrase ""Job-like figure"" directly points to biblical themes of suffering and endurance, confirming that the source of the allusion is indeed the Bible, rather than Roman history."

However, even though his company is perceived as fiscally irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Tyler is, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs the logical fallacy of guilt by association by implying that Tyler is untrustworthy with money simply because he works for a company that has filed for bankruptcy. This fallacy discredits Tyler based on his association with the company rather than evaluating his individual financial responsibility or capabilities. The argument fails because it does not provide any evidence of Tyler's personal financial behavior, demonstrating that the conclusion about his trustworthiness is unfounded and biased."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian.

Step 1: Interpret the model.
.
Use the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.
You can see from the model that lithium bromide is composed of lithium atoms and bromine atoms bonded together.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that lithium bromide is composed of two chemical elements: lithium and bromine. Since lithium bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, lithium bromide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Lithium bromide is classified as a compound because it is formed from two different chemical elements, lithium and bromine, which are bonded together. In chemistry, a compound is defined as a substance that consists of two or more different elements chemically combined in fixed proportions. Since lithium bromide contains both lithium and bromine atoms, it does not qualify as an elementary substance, which would consist of a single type of atom. Therefore, the correct choice is that lithium bromide is a compound."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a water balloon is 17 fluid ounces.
17 cups and 17 gallons are both too much."	"ANSWER: 17 fluid ounces  
SOLUTION: A typical water balloon can hold a volume of around 10 to 20 fluid ounces, making 17 fluid ounces a reasonable estimate for its capacity. In contrast, 17 cups and 17 gallons represent volumes that are significantly larger than what a standard water balloon can contain. Therefore, 17 fluid ounces is the most appropriate choice when considering the average size of a water balloon."

SOLUTION: The text employs assonance as it features the repetition of the vowel sound 'i' in the words ""if,"" ""licking,"" ""invisible,"" and ""lips."" This creates a musical quality and enhances the flow of the sentence. Euphemism, on the other hand, involves substituting a mild or vague term for one considered harsh or blunt, which is not present in the text.

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are oriented such that like poles are facing each other; specifically, the north pole of one magnet is near the north pole of the other magnet. According to the fundamental law of magnetism, like poles (north-north or south-south) repel, while opposite poles (north-south) attract. Therefore, since both poles are north, the magnets will push away from each other, resulting in a repelling effect."

The Podolsk mole rat has large front teeth. Its mouth is adapted for gnawing.
The tamandua has a long tube-shaped mouth and no teeth. Its mouth is not adapted for gnawing. The tamandua uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the Podolsk mole rat because, like the nutria, it has large front teeth that are specifically adapted for gnawing. This adaptation allows the Podolsk mole rat to efficiently break off small pieces of food, similar to how the nutria utilizes its teeth for eating plant parts. In contrast, the tamandua has a long tube-shaped mouth without teeth, which is not suited for gnawing but rather for extracting insects, making it unsuitable for this question."

The center of our planet is very hot. Deep below Earth's surface, rocks can be heated to high temperatures. The rocks can also be squeezed by the weight of rocks around them. Sometimes, the heating and squeezing changes the type of minerals in a rock. These changes form a new type of rock, called a metamorphic rock. The word metamorphic comes from the word metamorphism, which means change."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Marble is classified as a metamorphic rock because it forms when limestone undergoes metamorphism, which involves heating and squeezing. This process alters the original limestone, changing its mineral composition and structure to create marble. The characteristics of marble, such as its crystalline texture and ability to be polished, are typical of metamorphic rocks. Therefore, the correct choice is (0) metamorphic."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Pouring milk on oatmeal is a physical change. The oatmeal and milk form a creamy mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Water evaporating from a puddle is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But pouring milk on oatmeal is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: Both changes are physical changes, as neither results in the formation of a new substance. Pouring milk on oatmeal creates a mixture without altering the chemical structure of the components, and water evaporating from a puddle changes its state from liquid to gas without changing its chemical identity. Therefore, the correct choice is that both are only physical changes."

50 meters is too long."	"ANSWER: 50 centimeters  
SOLUTION: A standard tennis racket typically measures between 68 to 73 centimeters in length, which is significantly shorter than 50 meters. Therefore, 50 centimeters is a much more reasonable and accurate estimate for the length of a tennis racket. The option of 50 meters is impractical, as it exceeds the typical dimensions of sports equipment like tennis rackets by a wide margin. Thus, 50 centimeters is the correct choice."

The only arrow pointing from the black rockfish leads to the kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the black rockfish to the sea cucumber.. kelp bass. The only arrow pointing from the kelp bass leads to the bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the kelp bass to the sea cucumber.. bat star. No arrows point from the bat star to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bat star to the sea cucumber..	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The only viable path from an organism to the sea cucumber is through the kelp. The food web indicates that matter moves from kelp to sea urchins, then to sea otters, followed by orcas, and finally to the sea cucumber. The other organisms listed (bat star, kelp bass, and black rockfish) do not have any arrows leading to the sea cucumber, thereby indicating that matter from these organisms does not contribute to the sea cucumber's matter.

Its scientific name is Goura victoria.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A Victoria crowned pigeon's scientific name is Goura victoria.
Dendrobates leucomelas does not have the same scientific name as a Victoria crowned pigeon. So, Goura victoria and Dendrobates leucomelas are not in the same species.
Aequorea victoria does have the same species within its genus as a Victoria crowned pigeon, but they are not in the same genus! They do not have the same scientific name as each other. So, these organisms are not in the same species.
Goura victoria has the same scientific name as a Victoria crowned pigeon. So, these organisms are in the same species."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The Victoria crowned pigeon's scientific name is Goura victoria, which directly indicates its species. Among the given choices, only Goura victoria matches this scientific name. The other options, Dendrobates leucomelas and Aequorea victoria, do not share the same genus or species with the Victoria crowned pigeon, confirming that they are not in the same species. Therefore, the correct answer is 0, representing Goura victoria."

coarse-grained texture
no fixed crystal structure
solid
naturally occurring
not made by organisms
not a pure substance"	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of syenite match the properties of a rock. So, syenite is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Syenite is classified as a rock due to its coarse-grained texture and its lack of a fixed crystal structure. It is a naturally occurring solid that is not a pure substance, as it is composed of various minerals rather than being a single mineral itself. Additionally, syenite forms through geological processes rather than biological processes, further reinforcing its classification as a rock rather than a mineral. Therefore, the correct answer is that syenite is a rock."

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Ecological interactions	Interpret food webs II	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows to the parasol fungus.
There are two arrows pointing from the gray fox to other organisms. One arrow points to the bobcat. The only arrow pointing from the bobcat leads to the bolete fungus. The other arrow pointing from the gray fox leads to the bolete fungus. No arrows point from the bolete fungus to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the gray fox to the parasol fungus.
The only arrow pointing from the black racer leads to the bolete fungus. No arrows point from the bolete fungus to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the black racer to the parasol fungus.There is one path matter can take from the black bear to the parasol fungus: black bear->parasol fungus. bobcat. The only arrow pointing from the bobcat leads to the bolete fungus. No arrows point from the bolete fungus to any other organisms. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the bobcat to the parasol fungus.. There is one path matter can take from the beaver to the parasol fungus: beaver->black bear->parasol fungus."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: The only organism that has a direct path leading to the parasol fungus is the beaver. The food web indicates that matter moves from the beaver to the black bear, and then from the black bear to the parasol fungus. In contrast, the other options (gray fox, bobcat, and black racer) do not have any arrows leading to the parasol fungus, indicating that matter from these organisms does not contribute to the matter contained in the parasol fungus. Therefore, the beaver is the correct answer as it is the only organism from which matter eventually moves to the parasol fungus."

	Is a lamp a good or a service?	['a service', 'a good']	1		closed choice	grade2	social science	economics	Economics	Goods and services	"Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.
A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether a lamp is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a lamp something you can touch? Yes.
Is a lamp a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a lamp is a good."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A lamp is classified as a good because it is a tangible item that can be physically touched and owned. Unlike services, which involve actions or tasks performed by individuals (such as cleaning or teaching), a lamp exists as a product that can be purchased and used. This distinction is clear when considering the nature of goods as physical objects versus services as activities or benefits provided. Therefore, the answer is choice (1) a good."
	"Which tense does the sentence use?
Everyone will admire your strength and courage."	['past tense', 'present tense', 'future tense']	2		closed choice	grade4	language science	verbs	Verb tense	Is the sentence in the past, present, or future tense?	"Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.

Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, admire. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Everyone will admire your strength and courage"" uses the future tense because it includes the auxiliary verb ""will"" followed by the base form of the main verb ""admire."" This construction indicates an action that is expected to occur at a later time. The use of ""will"" clearly signals that the admiration is not happening currently or in the past but is anticipated in the future."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	An empty glass is a solid. If someone drops a glass, it may break into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: An empty glass is considered a solid because it retains a definite shape and volume. Solids are characterized by their fixed structure, which allows them to maintain their form under normal conditions. Even when the glass is empty, it does not change into a liquid or gas; it remains a solid object. Therefore, the correct classification of an empty glass is as a solid."

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. He has been replaced with Jake.
Jake and his best friend go to the same college, but Jake is graduating this coming June."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""he"" could refer to either Jake or his best friend, creating ambiguity. In contrast, the first answer choice explicitly states ""Jake,"" clarifying who is graduating. This distinction helps prevent confusion and ensures that the reader understands exactly who is being discussed. Therefore, the second choice is the one with the vague pronoun reference."

['imperative', 'exclamatory', 'interrogative']	0		closed choice	grade9	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement and always ends with a period.

An exclamatory sentence is a statement that shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamation always ends with an exclamation point.
I can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!"	The sentence makes a demand, so it is an imperative sentence. Here, it ends with a period.	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Give me one good reason I should consider purchasing a hybrid vehicle."" is structured as a question, seeking information or clarification regarding the benefits of a hybrid vehicle. It is formulated in a way that expects a response, which is characteristic of an interrogative sentence. Although it may appear to solicit a demand, the presence of the question word ""why"" indicates that it is ultimately seeking information, thus categorizing it as interrogative."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to their mass and speed. In this scenario, although both samples contain the same number of particles and have the same average speed, the particles in sample A are more massive. Since kinetic energy is calculated as (1/2)mv², the greater mass of sample A's particles results in higher average kinetic energy compared to sample B. Therefore, sample A, having the higher average kinetic energy, corresponds to a higher temperature."

Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question asks whether the magnets will attract or repel each other based on their poles. Since the south pole of one magnet is positioned near the south pole of the other magnet, and like poles repel, the two magnets will repel each other.

['a song', 'classical mythology']	1		closed choice	grade9	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Herculean is classical mythology.
In classical mythology, Hercules is the son of a god and possesses incredible, superhuman strength.
The allusion Herculean means powerful."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The term ""Herculean"" is derived from classical mythology, specifically from the character Hercules, who is known for his extraordinary strength and heroic feats. In the context of the sentence, the use of ""Herculean effort"" suggests that the task of moving the stalled car required immense strength and determination, akin to what Hercules would have demonstrated. This allusion emphasizes the difficulty of the task at hand, making it clear that the effort was not just significant, but almost superhuman in nature."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two blocks of steel have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 65°F block is colder than the 110°F block, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task asks which object has less thermal energy between two identical blocks of steel with different temperatures. The block at 65°F has a lower temperature compared to the block at 110°F, meaning it possesses less thermal energy. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; therefore, the block at the lower temperature (65°F) will have less thermal energy than the one at the higher temperature (110°F)."

Mrs. Trevino told her friend that she needs to exercise on a regular basis and get more sleep in order to have more energy throughout the day.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Mrs. Trevino told her friend to exercise on a regular basis and get more sleep in order to have more energy throughout the day."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose answer 1 because it contains the vague pronoun ""she,"" which could refer to either Mrs. Trevino or her friend, creating ambiguity. The lack of clarity regarding who ""she"" refers to makes it difficult for the reader to understand the intended meaning. In contrast, answer 0 avoids this vagueness by restructuring the sentence to clearly specify that the friend is the one who needs to exercise and get more sleep. Therefore, answer 1 exemplifies the issue of vague pronoun reference, while answer 0 demonstrates a clearer communication of the message."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=104x177 at 0x31376DFD0>	Is a watch a solid, a liquid, or a gas?	['a solid', 'a liquid', 'a gas']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"A watch is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A watch can bend to fit your wrist, but the watch will still have its own shape."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A watch is categorized as a solid because it maintains a definite shape and volume. Despite its ability to bend slightly, such as when it conforms to the shape of a wrist, it does not lose its inherent structure. Solids, including watches, are composed of tightly packed particles that do not flow, which distinguishes them from liquids and gases. Thus, the characteristics of a watch align with those of a solid object."
	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Malik can fly an airplane."	['inherited', 'acquired']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to fly an airplane. Instead, some people learn how to fly airplanes. So, flying an airplane is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The ability to fly an airplane is not something that is innate; it requires training, practice, and often certification. Individuals must acquire knowledge of aviation principles, flight mechanics, and safety protocols through formal education and hands-on experience. Therefore, this skill is categorized as an acquired trait rather than an inherited one."

Most of the people who knew Grayson considered him to be an unrepentant Casanova."	['Greek mythology', 'history']	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Casanova is history.
The autobiography of Giovanni Giacomo Casanova, an eighteenth-century Italian adventurer, details and perhaps exaggerates his amorous adventures and success with women.
The allusion Casanova means a womanizer."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The allusion to ""Casanova"" originates from historical context, specifically referring to Giovanni Giacomo Casanova, an Italian adventurer known for his numerous romantic exploits in the 18th century. His autobiography contributes to the perception of him as a quintessential womanizer, thus making the term synonymous with someone who is unrepentantly promiscuous. While there are figures in Greek mythology who embody similar traits, the specific reference to Casanova is rooted in historical accounts of his life and reputation."
	Which phrase has a more positive connotation?	['an impatient person', 'an eager person']	1		closed choice	grade4	language science	vocabulary	Shades of meaning	Positive and negative connotation	"Connotation is the feeling or idea that goes along with a word or phrase. Some words are close in meaning but have different connotations.
For example, think about the words eager and impatient. They both mean wanting something to happen, but they have different connotations.
Eager has a positive connotation. It is a nice word. An eager person is happy and excited.
Impatient has a negative connotation. It is not a nice word. An impatient person is often pushy and demanding."	An eager person has a more positive connotation. An eager person is excited and happy. An impatient person is often rude, pushy, or demanding.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""an eager person"" because it conveys enthusiasm and a willingness to engage, which are generally viewed as positive traits. In contrast, ""an impatient person"" suggests a lack of tolerance and can imply negativity, such as rudeness or annoyance. The word ""eager"" evokes a sense of excitement and proactivity, while ""impatient"" tends to have a more critical or unfavorable undertone. Therefore, the phrase ""an eager person"" carries a more positive connotation overall."
	Compare the motion of three cars. Which car was moving at the lowest speed?

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each car moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each car moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each car moved for 10 hours. The car that moved 240 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that car must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: To determine which car was moving at the lowest speed, we calculate the speed of each car using the formula speed = distance/time. For the first car, the speed is 700 kilometers / 10 hours = 70 km/h. For the second car, the speed is 380 kilometers / 10 hours = 38 km/h. For the third car, the speed is 240 kilometers / 10 hours = 24 km/h. Among these speeds, the third car has the lowest speed at 24 km/h, indicating it was moving the slowest."

Julia Child alludes to the famous chef who is known for popularizing French cuisine in the United States."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text uses an allusion by referencing Julia Child, a renowned chef known for her cooking expertise. This comparison implies that Evelyn's cooking is of exceptional quality, similar to that of Julia Child. A pun, on the other hand, would involve a play on words with humorous intent, which is not present in this context. Therefore, the correct figure of speech in this instance is an allusion."

The chromosomes contain the information that the cell uses for growth and activities. In animal and plant cells, the chromosomes are inside the nucleus."	Vacuoles store water, waste, and nutrients such as sugar. Animal cells usually have several small vacuoles.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""vacuoles"" because they are the organelles responsible for storing nutrients, waste, and water in animal cells. Although mitochondria are crucial for energy production and cytoplasm is the gel-like substance that fills the cell, neither of these play a primary role in storage. Vacuoles, particularly in animal cells, are often smaller and numerous compared to those in plant cells, but they still serve the essential function of maintaining homeostasis by managing the cell's storage needs."

SOLUTION: A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause that expresses a complete thought. In this case, the first choice, ""Mr. Lowery's afternoon lecture was about art and culture in Germany before World War II,"" is a simple sentence as it has a subject (""Mr. Lowery's afternoon lecture"") and a predicate (""was about art and culture in Germany before World War II""). The second choice, however, contains a compound structure with two independent clauses connected by ""or,"" making it a compound sentence rather than a simple one."

"Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each duck moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each duck moved for 10 hours. The duck that moved 1,055 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: To determine which duck was moving at the highest speed, we compare the distances traveled by each duck over the same time period of 10 hours. The first duck traveled 1,055 kilometers, the second duck 610 kilometers, and the third duck 850 kilometers. Since all ducks moved for the same duration, the duck that covered the greatest distance, which is the first duck, must have had the highest speed. Thus, the duck that moved 1,055 kilometers in 10 hours is the correct answer."

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	In this experiment, Jeanette and Bryant investigated whether adding wax to snowboards affects their speed. There was no wax on the snowboards with wax removed. So, they were part of a control group.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The control group in this experiment consists of the snowboards with wax removed (choice 0). This is because the control group is used to establish a baseline to compare the effects of the experimental condition, which in this case involves the snowboards with wax added (choice 1). By riding the snowboard without wax, Jeanette provided a standard for measuring the difference in speed when wax was applied. Thus, the snowboards without wax serve as the control for the experiment."

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.
They use the sugars they produce during photosynthesis as food. This food provides energy that helps the organisms live, grow, and reproduce."	"This organism is photosynthetic:
The text tells you that a barrel cactus is a producer that uses energy from sunlight to make its own food. This is evidence that the barrel cactus is a photosynthetic organism.
This organism is not photosynthetic:
The text does not provide evidence that the crown-of-thorns starfish is photosynthetic."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the text explicitly states that the barrel cactus is a producer that makes its own food using energy from sunlight, indicating that it undergoes photosynthesis. In contrast, the crown-of-thorns starfish is described as a consumer that feeds on other organisms, which means it does not perform photosynthesis. The clear distinction between the roles of these organisms in their ecosystems supports the conclusion that the barrel cactus is the photosynthetic organism."

	Which empty mug has a higher temperature?	['the empty mug with more thermal energy', 'the empty mug with less thermal energy']	0	Two empty mugs are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two empty mugs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the empty mug with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question compares two identical empty mugs that differ only in their thermal energy levels. According to the principles of thermodynamics, an object's temperature is directly related to its thermal energy. Therefore, the empty mug with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature, which leads to the conclusion that the correct choice is the empty mug with more thermal energy (choice 0).

The two cups of black tea are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cup of black tea with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose option (0) because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Since both cups are identical in mass and material, the cup with more thermal energy will inherently have a higher temperature. This is due to the fact that thermal energy is a measure of the total kinetic energy of particles in a substance; therefore, an increase in thermal energy corresponds to an increase in temperature."

Taricha torosa does not have the same scientific name as a marbled salamander. So, Ambystoma opacum and Taricha torosa are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The marbled salamander is scientifically classified as Ambystoma opacum. Therefore, the organism in the same species as the marbled salamander is also Ambystoma opacum itself. Both Lissotriton helveticus and Taricha torosa belong to different genera and species, so they cannot be considered the same species as the marbled salamander.

SOLUTION: The red-headed poison frog possesses all the necessary traits of an amphibian: it spends part of its life in water and part on land, has moist skin, and lays eggs without shells. In contrast, the Canadian lynx does not exhibit these traits as it is a mammal, characterized by feeding its offspring milk and having fur. Therefore, based on the traits outlined for amphibians, the red-headed poison frog is the only correct choice."
	Which is the most flexible?	['glass bowl', 'wood board', 'metal hair clip']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Materials	Compare properties of materials	"Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it."	"Flexible is a property. A flexible material can be bent without breaking easily.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine bending the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the metal hair clip is the most flexible. If you gently bend a metal hairclip, it will not break."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The metal hair clip is the most flexible option among the choices presented. While glass is brittle and will shatter rather than bend, and a wood board is typically rigid and can break under stress, the metal hair clip is designed to be flexible and can be bent without breaking. This characteristic allows it to return to its original shape after being manipulated, making it the best choice for flexibility."

The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase creeps up on you. It describes time as if it were a sneaky person.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the phrase ""creeps up on you"" because it attributes a human-like quality to time, suggesting that it can move stealthily and unexpectedly, much like a sneaky person would. This personification creates a vivid image of time as an entity that can influence our lives in subtle ways. In contrast, the phrase ""affects everyone"" does not provide a similar personification; it simply states a fact without attributing any human characteristics to time. Therefore, ""creeps up on you"" is the more fitting choice for the task."

The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground."	"Look at the picture of the snow leopard.
The snow leopard has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice. The fur can help keep the snow leopard's feet warm. The large pads help spread its weight over a larger area. This allows it to walk on ice without slipping and to walk on snow without sinking in too deep.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The Siberian tiger has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice.
The tokay gecko has wide, sticky toes. Its feet are not adapted to walk on snow and ice. The tokay gecko uses its feet to climb trees and walk on leaves."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The Siberian tiger has adaptations similar to those of the snow leopard, including furry feet with large pads, which help it walk on snow and ice. These adaptations allow the tiger to maintain traction and prevent slipping on icy surfaces, similar to the snow leopard's adaptations. In contrast, the tokay gecko's feet are designed for climbing and are not suitable for navigating snowy or icy terrains. Therefore, the correct choice is the Siberian tiger, as it shares the necessary adaptations for walking on snow and ice."

4 inches is too short. 4 yards and 4 miles are too long."	"ANSWER: 4 feet  
SOLUTION: I chose 4 feet as the best estimate for the length of a sofa because it is a commonly accepted size for standard sofas. Sofas typically range in length from about 5 to 8 feet, but 4 feet is a reasonable approximation for smaller or compact models. The other options, such as 4 inches, are much too short, while 4 yards and 4 miles are excessively long for a sofa's dimensions. Therefore, 4 feet is the most logical choice."

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for a black coat, and the allele l is for a red coat.
Echo, a cow from this group, has a red coat. Echo has two alleles for a red coat."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the coat color trait is a red coat. So, Echo's phenotype for the coat color trait is a red coat.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Echo's phenotype for the coat color trait is observed as a red coat. Since the allele for a red coat is represented by ""l"" and Echo possesses two alleles for this trait, her genotype must be ""ll"". According to the information provided, the phenotype is the observable characteristic, which in this case is a red coat. Therefore, the correct answer that describes Echo's phenotype is a red coat, corresponding to choice (0)."

The property that all four objects have in common is opaque."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""opaque"" because all four objects do not allow light to pass through them, making them opaque. The other two options, ""flexible"" and ""rough,"" do not apply to all four objects; only some of them exhibit these properties. For example, while the hair clip is flexible, the building blocks are not, and the hair clip and binder are not rough. Therefore, ""opaque"" is the only property that all four objects share."

A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Molasses is a liquid. But all minerals are solids.
Molasses is made by humans. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, molasses is not a mineral.
Native copper is a mineral.
Diamond is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose molasses as the answer because it is a liquid and all minerals must be solid substances. Additionally, molasses is produced by humans, while minerals occur naturally and are not created by living organisms. The other two options, native copper and diamond, are both solid substances formed in nature, aligning with the definition of minerals. Thus, molasses is the only substance that does not fit the criteria of being a mineral."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The statement is false because Jupiter's volume is not more than 10,000 times that of Mars. The volume of Mars is approximately 0.15 x 10^15 km^3, and multiplying this by 10,000 gives 1.5 x 10^19 km^3. In contrast, Jupiter's volume is approximately 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is significantly less than 1.5 x 10^19 km^3. Therefore, the claim that Jupiter's volume exceeds 10,000 times that of Mars is incorrect."

There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The question asks about the comparative magnetic force between two pairs of magnets. Since the magnetic force is inversely related to the distance between the magnets, the pair with a smaller distance will exhibit a greater magnetic force. Given that Pair 2 has a smaller distance between its magnets compared to Pair 1, it can be concluded that the magnitude of the magnetic force is indeed greater in Pair 2. Therefore, the correct answer is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.
A football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long."	"The best estimate for the length of a garden rake is 6 feet.
6 inches is too short. 6 yards and 6 miles are too long."	"ANSWER: 6 feet  
SOLUTION: A garden rake typically has a handle length that is practical for use, usually ranging from about 5 to 7 feet. Among the given choices, 6 feet is the most reasonable estimate, as it provides sufficient length for effective use while being manageable for most users. The option of 6 inches is impractically short for a garden rake, while 6 yards and 6 miles are excessively long and unrealistic for such a tool. Therefore, 6 feet is the best and most accurate estimate for the length of a garden rake."
	"Is the following trait inherited or acquired?
Charlie can ride a motorcycle."	['acquired', 'inherited']	0	Hint: Riding a motorcycle well takes practice.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Traits and heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to ride a motorcycle. Instead, many people learn how to ride. So, riding a motorcycle is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Riding a motorcycle is a skill that individuals learn through practice and experience, rather than something they are born with. It requires training, coordination, and understanding of the vehicle, which all develop over time. Since these abilities are not innate and must be acquired through effort and learning, the trait of being able to ride a motorcycle is classified as an acquired trait."

	How long does it take to bake lasagna in the oven?	['39 hours', '39 minutes']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to bake lasagna in the oven is 39 minutes.
39 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 39 minutes  
SOLUTION: Baking lasagna typically takes between 30 to 60 minutes in the oven, depending on the recipe and whether it is being baked from scratch or reheated. Given the two choices, 39 minutes falls within this common range, making it a more realistic estimate. In contrast, 39 hours is excessively long and impractical for baking lasagna, as it would not yield a desirable outcome. Therefore, 39 minutes is the better choice."

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The analysis shows that the magnets in Pair 1 are smaller than those in Pair 2. Since the size of the magnets affects the magnitude of the magnetic force, and all other factors are constant, the smaller magnets in Pair 1 result in a smaller magnetic force compared to the larger magnets in Pair 2. Additionally, the direction of the magnetic force (attraction vs. repulsion) does not influence the magnitudes of the forces, further supporting that the force is indeed smaller in Pair 1. Thus, the correct answer is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1."

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
The book critic thought The Fault in Our Stars was well-written, but I didn't like the ending."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""it"" can be interpreted in two ways: it could refer to ""the ending"" or ""The Fault in Our Stars."" This ambiguity makes the meaning unclear. In contrast, the first answer choice clearly separates the opinions by specifying ""the ending"" and ""the book critic thought it was well-written,"" thus avoiding any vague references.

SOLUTION: The statement presents Leah with only two options: either stop reading paranormal romance novels or admit to not believing in empowering women. This creates a false dichotomy because it ignores the possibility that Leah can hold both views simultaneously—she can enjoy those novels and still be an advocate for women's empowerment.

The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water boiling is caused by heating. But carving a piece of wood is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both carving a piece of wood and water boiling on a stove are examples of physical changes, where the substance retains its original properties. In the case of carving, the wood changes shape but remains wood, while boiling water changes from liquid to gas without altering its chemical composition. Therefore, the correct answer is that both changes are only physical changes, as no new substances are formed in either process."

SOLUTION: The verbal irony in Lexi's statement, ""Someone had better turn on the heat,"" while she is sweating, implies that the temperature is excessively warm. Instead of genuinely suggesting the need for more heat, her comment highlights the absurdity of the situation, as she is already uncomfortable due to the heat.

"	"An American white pelican's scientific name is Pelecanus erythrorhynchos. The first word of its scientific name is Pelecanus.
Ardea herodias is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea herodias and Pelecanus erythrorhynchos are not in the same genus.
Pelecanus philippensis is in the genus Pelecanus. The first word of its scientific name is Pelecanus. So, Pelecanus philippensis and Pelecanus erythrorhynchos are in the same genus.

SOLUTION: The American white pelican, scientifically known as Pelecanus erythrorhynchos, belongs to the genus Pelecanus. Among the given choices, Pelecanus philippensis is also classified under the genus Pelecanus, which means both species share the same genus. In contrast, Ardea herodias and Strix uralensis belong to different genera (Ardea and Strix, respectively) and are therefore not in the same genus as the American white pelican.

The Aden Ridge began to form millions of years ago as the Somalian Plate and the Arabian Plate moved away from each other. The plates are slowly moving apart at a rate of about 2 centimeters per year. On the map, the ridge is shown in the Gulf of Aden, between the countries of Somalia and Yemen."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Plate tectonics	Describe tectonic plate boundaries around the world	"The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
divergent plate boundary
When plates at a divergent boundary move apart, cracks form in the crust along the boundary. Melted rock rises from below the crust to fill these cracks. As the melted rock cools and hardens, it becomes new oceanic crust.
Newer oceanic crust weighs less than older oceanic crust. So, the crust on either side of the boundary rises up higher than the older crust that is farther from the boundary. This difference in elevation creates a mid-ocean ridge, or underwater mountain chain. Between the two plates, there may be a deep rift valley."	"To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Aden Ridge, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Aden Ridge began to form millions of years ago as the Somalian Plate and the Arabian Plate moved away from each other. The plates are slowly moving apart at a rate of about 2 centimeters per year. On the map, the ridge is shown in the Gulf of Aden, between the countries of Somalia and Yemen.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Aden Ridge formed as the two plates moved away from each other, or diverged. So, the Aden Ridge formed at a divergent boundary."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage clearly states that the Somalian Plate and the Arabian Plate are moving away from each other, which indicates that the plates are diverging. This movement at a divergent boundary results in the formation of features like ridges. Therefore, based on the description of the plate interaction and the type of boundary involved, the correct answer is that the Aden Ridge formed at a divergent boundary."

Kenneth, a human from this group, does not have Thomsen disease. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Kenneth has two alleles for not having Thomsen disease (m). So, Kenneth's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Kenneth does not have Thomsen disease, which indicates that he must have the alleles associated with not having the disease. Given that the allele for having Thomsen disease is M and the allele for not having it is m, and since Kenneth has two alleles for not having the disease, his genotype must be mm. Therefore, the choice that represents Kenneth's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm, corresponding to option 1."

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases

The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Edna started sledding. As Edna rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Edna rode down the hill."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: As Edna rode down the hill, the gravitational potential energy between the sled and Earth decreased. This is because gravitational potential energy is directly related to the height of an object above a reference point; in this case, the reference point is Earth's center. Since Edna was moving from a higher elevation to a lower elevation, the distance between the sled and the center of the Earth decreased, resulting in a decrease in gravitational potential energy. Thus, the correct choice is that the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased."

ba / by: long a / long e"	The word help ends with a consonant and has a short vowel sound. So, it has a closed syllable.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The word ""help"" is classified as having a closed syllable because it ends with a consonant (the letter 'p'), which follows a short vowel sound (the letter 'e'). In closed syllables, the vowel is typically followed by one or more consonants, creating a closed sound. This characteristic distinguishes it from an open syllable, which would end in a vowel and usually have a long vowel sound. Therefore, the correct choice is closed."

['away from the center of Earth', 'toward the center of Earth']	1	A woman pours hot water from a teapot. The force of Earth's gravity pulls the water downward so that it falls into the teacup.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Identify directions of forces	"A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to another. Every force has a direction.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The force of Earth's gravity pulls the hot water downward. The direction of the pull is toward the center of Earth.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question asks about the direction of the gravitational pull exerted by Earth on the hot water being poured. Gravity always acts toward the center of the Earth, causing objects to fall downwards when released. In this scenario, the hot water is pulled down into the teacup due to this gravitational force, confirming that the direction of the pull is indeed toward the center of the Earth. Therefore, the correct choice is (1) toward the center of Earth."
	How long is a soccer field?	['120 meters', '120 kilometers']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a soccer field is 120 meters.
120 kilometers is too long."	"ANSWER: 120 meters  
SOLUTION: A standard soccer field length ranges from 100 to 110 meters for international matches, with the maximum length being 120 meters. In contrast, 120 kilometers is an impractically large distance for a soccer field, exceeding the length of any typical field by a significant margin. Therefore, 120 meters is the correct estimate, as it falls within the accepted dimensions for soccer fields, making it the logical choice."

The simile life was like a box of chocolates suggests that life is unpredictable. You don't know what type of filling is inside a chocolate until you try it, just as you don't know what life holds for you until it happens."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The simile ""life was like a box of chocolates"" suggests that life is unpredictable because, just like the varied fillings in chocolates, you cannot foresee the experiences and challenges that life will present. Each chocolate represents a different outcome or experience, emphasizing the element of surprise in life. The phrase captures the essence of uncertainty and excitement that comes with living, aligning perfectly with the idea that you never know what you will encounter next. Therefore, the correct choice is that life is unpredictable."

['climate', 'weather']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Pedro lives in a town with hot summers and freezing cold winters.
This passage tells you about the usual temperatures where Pedro lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The passage provides information about the typical conditions in Pedro's town, specifically noting that it experiences hot summers and freezing cold winters. This description reflects long-term patterns rather than a specific day's weather, which is indicative of climate. Weather refers to short-term atmospheric conditions, whereas climate encompasses the average conditions over a longer period, making ""climate"" the correct choice in this context."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	['The vinyl album broke just as Mr. Tang was about to play it on his old record player.', 'Just as Mr. Tang was about to play the vinyl album on his old record player, it broke.']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it could refer to the vinyl album or the record player.
Just as Mr. Tang was about to play the vinyl album on his old record player, it broke.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
The vinyl album broke just as Mr. Tang was about to play it on his old record player."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose answer 1 because it contains a vague pronoun reference with the pronoun ""it,"" which could refer to either the vinyl album or the old record player. This ambiguity makes the sentence unclear regarding what exactly broke. In contrast, answer 0 clarifies the subject by specifying that the vinyl album broke, eliminating any confusion. The distinction in wording between the two choices highlights the importance of precise pronoun usage in maintaining clarity in writing."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The magnetic force between magnets is influenced by the distance separating them; a smaller distance results in a stronger magnetic force. In this case, Pair 2 has magnets that are positioned closer together than those in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is indeed greater in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1, making option (1) the correct choice."

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	Chalcopyrite has all the properties of a mineral. So, chalcopyrite is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1

not a pure substance"	yes or no	grade5	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Properties are used to identify different substances. Minerals have the following properties:
It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	A silkmoth caterpillar makes a silk cocoon to protect itself during metamorphosis. In a silk factory, the silk from many silkmoth cocoons is spun into fabric. Silkmoth caterpillars that are used to make silk are often called silkworms.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Silk is not a mineral; it is a natural protein fiber produced by silkmoth caterpillars. Unlike minerals, silk does not have a fixed crystal structure, which is one of the defining characteristics of minerals. Additionally, silk is a complex organic substance rather than a simple inorganic compound, further distinguishing it from minerals. Therefore, the correct answer is ""no."""

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion spartan is Greek history.
Soldiers from the city of Sparta in ancient Greece were known for their self-restraint, self-discipline, and indifference to luxury.
The allusion spartan means simple and austere."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""spartan"" in the sentence refers to the historical context of Sparta in ancient Greece, known for its militaristic culture and emphasis on discipline and simplicity. Spartan society valued austere living and self-restraint, which is why the term ""spartan ways"" suggests a lifestyle devoid of excess and luxury. The choice of Greek history is reinforced by the characteristics associated with Spartan soldiers, who were trained to be tough and resilient, making this allusion distinctly tied to that historical context rather than any biblical reference."

['acquired', 'inherited']	0	Hint: Most scars are caused by accidents during a person's life.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The trait in question, a scar on Layla's left elbow, is classified as an acquired trait because it results from an injury or accident that occurs during her life, rather than being passed down genetically from her parents. Scars are physical marks that develop as a response to healing from a wound, which means they are influenced by environmental factors and personal experiences. Unlike inherited traits, which are genetic and present at birth, scars are formed through life events, making them clearly acquired."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 10 hours. The ship that moved 280 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: To determine which ship was moving at the lowest speed, we calculate the speed of each ship using the formula: speed = distance/time. All ships traveled for the same duration of 10 hours, so we only need to compare the distances they covered. The first ship traveled 290 miles, the second 310 miles, and the third 280 miles. Since 280 miles is the shortest distance covered, the third ship (the one that moved 280 miles east) must have been moving at the lowest speed."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the problem states that the strength of the magnetic force is influenced by the distance between the magnets. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than those in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is consequently stronger. This reasoning aligns with the principle that magnetic forces diminish with increased distance between the magnets. Thus, the correct statement is that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1."

SOLUTION: The action of taking a book off a shelf involves the woman's hand exerting a force that draws the book toward her. This action is characterized as a ""pull"" because the force is directed toward her body, rather than pushing the book away from the shelf. When a person takes an object from a shelf, they typically grasp it and pull it towards themselves, which aligns with the definition of pulling as a force that moves an object closer.

This kind of change is called a change of state."	Sawing a log in half is a physical change. The log splits into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""physical change"" because sawing a log in half does not alter the chemical composition of the wood; it simply changes its physical form. The log is still wood, just in two pieces instead of one. This type of change is characterized by a change in state, shape, or size, without any change to the identity of the substance itself.

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force depends on the distance between the magnets, and since the distance in both pairs is the same, the magnetic force must also be the same. The materials of the magnets are identical, which eliminates any variability in strength due to material differences.

"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The key to determining the temperature of the samples lies in the average kinetic energy of the particles. Since both samples contain the same number of particles and have the same average speed, the mass of the particles becomes crucial. Sample B's particles are more massive, which results in a higher average kinetic energy compared to the lighter particles in sample A. Therefore, because sample B has a higher average kinetic energy, it must also have the higher temperature."

There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.

Astro is a horse from this group. Astro has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Astro's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Astro's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Astro's genotype is Ll, where L represents the dominant allele for a black coat and l represents the recessive allele for a reddish-brown coat. Since the presence of at least one dominant allele (L) results in the expression of the dominant phenotype, Astro will display the black coat phenotype. Therefore, the correct answer is that Astro's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat."

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to their temperature. In this case, the problem states that the particles in sample B have a higher average speed compared to those in sample A. Since kinetic energy is calculated using the formula KE = (1/2)mv², where m is mass and v is velocity, the higher speed of particles in sample B indicates they possess greater kinetic energy.

Pyrite is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: A marble is not a mineral because it is manufactured in a factory, while minerals are naturally occurring substances. Hornblende and pyrite, on the other hand, are both naturally formed and classified as minerals. The key distinction here lies in the origin of the substances; since marble is not formed in nature but rather created artificially, it does not meet the criteria to be classified as a mineral."
	Which is harder?	['wood board', 'wool sweater']	0		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Materials	Compare properties of materials	"Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it."	"Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the wood board is harder. If you press on a piece of wood, it will not change shape."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The task requires determining which material is harder between a wood board and a wool sweater. Hardness is defined by a material's ability to maintain its shape under pressure. When you press on a wood board, it does not deform, indicating it is hard. In contrast, a wool sweater would compress and change shape under the same pressure, demonstrating it is much softer than wood. Therefore, the wood board is the harder of the two materials."

"Look at the picture of the necktie.
The necktie is made of silk.
Silk comes from small insects called silk moths. The silk moth caterpillars spin cocoons out of silk thread. Humans use the silk thread to make fabric."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The necktie is identified as being made of silk, which is a luxurious fabric known for its smooth texture and sheen. The hint suggests that the material can be discerned from a picture, and since silk is commonly used for neckties due to its elegance, it aligns with the provided choices. Additionally, the explanation regarding silk's origin from silk moths reinforces the material's authenticity and quality, further supporting the conclusion that the necktie is indeed made of silk."

The correct title is Marley and Me."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The correct title of the movie follows the standard capitalization rules, where the first word and important words are capitalized, while conjunctions like ""and"" are not. In this case, ""Marley"" and ""Me"" are both important words and should be capitalized, while ""and"" remains lowercase. Therefore, the correct title is ""Marley and Me,"" which corresponds to choice (1). The other option, ""marley and Me,"" incorrectly capitalizes only one important word and fails to capitalize the first word."

Trade winds are steady winds that blow towards the equator. On Thursday, they were blowing strong from the north in Cape Verde.
The underlined part of the passage tells you about the wind direction in Cape Verde on Thursday. This passage describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage specifically mentions the wind direction in Cape Verde on a particular day, Thursday, which indicates a temporary condition of the atmosphere. This aligns with the definition of weather, which pertains to the current state of the atmosphere at a specific time and place. In contrast, climate refers to longer-term patterns of weather over an extended period. Therefore, the focus on the winds on a specific day clearly categorizes the passage as describing the weather."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: I chose sample A because the information indicates that each particle in sample A has a higher average speed than those in sample B, despite the greater mass of the particles in sample A. Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and the square of the velocity of the particles, which means that the higher speed of sample A's particles leads to a greater average kinetic energy compared to sample B. As a result, sample A has a higher temperature than sample B."

This color is yellow. The apron is not yellow.
A bendable object can be bent without breaking. The apron is bendable."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying which property best describes the object in question. The hint indicates that the color yellow does not apply to the apron, as it is stated that ""this color is yellow"" while simultaneously stating ""the apron is not yellow."" In contrast, the property of being bendable is relevant since it describes the functional characteristic of the apron, which can be bent without breaking. Therefore, the better answer that matches the object is (1) bendable."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of an eyelash is 7 millimeters.
7 centimeters, 7 meters, and 7 kilometers are all too long."	"ANSWER: 7

SOLUTION: The average length of a human eyelash ranges from about 6 to 12 millimeters, making 7 millimeters a reasonable estimate. The other options, such as 7 centimeters, 7 meters, and 7 kilometers, are significantly longer than the typical length of an eyelash, making them impractical choices. Therefore, 7 millimeters is the most accurate and sensible choice for the length of an eyelash."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram."	"The better estimate for the mass of an earthworm is 5 grams.
5 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 5 grams  
SOLUTION: The mass of an earthworm typically ranges from 5 grams to 10 grams depending on the species and size. Choosing 5 grams is a more realistic estimate as 5 kilograms would be excessively heavy for an earthworm, which generally weighs much less than a pound. The weight of 5 grams aligns with the known biological data for common earthworm species, making it the better choice in this context."

['Roman history', 'British history']	1		closed choice	grade9	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Luddite is British history.
In the early nineteenth century, factories were replacing the jobs of craftsmen. Some of these craftsmen banded together to destroy the new machinery; those who did so were called Luddites.
The allusion Luddite means a person opposed to new technology."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The term ""Luddite"" originates from British history, specifically referring to a movement in the early 19th century when artisans protested against the industrialization and the machinery that threatened their jobs. The Luddites were known for their opposition to technological advancements, which aligns with Abby’s perception of Mr. Larson as someone who resists modern technology by not owning a cell phone. This historical context underscores the allusion's meaning of being opposed to new technology, thus making British history the correct source of the allusion."

The correct title is An Eye for an Eye."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The title of a book should follow the title case conventions, where the first and last words, as well as any important words in between, are capitalized. In this case, ""An Eye for an Eye"" correctly capitalizes ""An,"" ""Eye,"" and ""Eye,"" while keeping ""for"" and ""an"" in lowercase, as they are not considered important words.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the yellow particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of yellow particles, look at both the number of yellow particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of yellow particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of yellow particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The analysis of the solutions indicates that both Solution A and Solution B contain the same number of yellow particles per unit of volume. This implies that the concentration of yellow particles, which is defined as the number of solute particles per milliliter of solvent, is equal in both solutions. Therefore, the correct choice is that neither solution has a higher concentration; their concentrations are the same."

<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=68x190 at 0x312C37A40>	Is a juice pop a solid, a liquid, or a gas?	['a liquid', 'a solid', 'a gas']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"A juice pop is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
If you take a juice pop out of the freezer, it will melt. While a juice pop is frozen, though, it is a solid."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: A juice pop is considered a solid because it retains its shape and size when frozen. While it is in the freezer, the juice pop is frozen and maintains its structure, which is characteristic of solids. When it melts, it turns into a liquid, but in its frozen state, it qualifies as a solid. Thus, the correct answer is option (1) a solid."

Zora, a koi fish from this group, has red eyes. Zora has two alleles for red eyes."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Zora has two alleles for red eyes (E). So, Zora's genotype for the eye color gene is EE.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Zora, the koi fish, has red eyes, which indicates that she possesses the dominant allele for eye color, designated as E. Since it is mentioned that Zora has two alleles for red eyes, her genotype must be homozygous for the dominant trait, which is represented as EE. Therefore, the correct choice that reflects Zora's genotype for the eye color gene is (1) EE."
	Two rocks have the same temperature but different masses. Which rock has less thermal energy?	['the rock with more mass', 'the rock with less mass']	1	The objects are made of the same type of matter.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two rocks have the same temperature and are made of the same type of matter. So, the rock with less mass has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Thermal energy is dependent on both temperature and mass. Since both rocks are at the same temperature and made of the same type of matter, their thermal energy is directly proportional to their mass. Therefore, the rock with less mass has less thermal energy compared to the rock with more mass. This is why the correct choice is the rock with less mass, which corresponds to option (1)."

Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

SOLUTION: I chose answer choice (1) because it contains the pronoun ""they,"" which lacks a clear antecedent in the sentence. Without context to specify who ""they"" refers to, the sentence becomes ambiguous. In contrast, answer choice (0) specifically names ""the authors,"" providing clarity and eliminating the vague reference present in choice (1).

Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One motorboat moved 355 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other motorboat moved 65 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each motorboat spent the same amount of time moving. The motorboat that moved 355 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The first motorboat traveled 355 kilometers in 5 hours, resulting in a speed of 71 kilometers per hour (355 km / 5 hrs). In contrast, the second motorboat traveled only 65 kilometers in the same time frame, yielding a speed of 13 kilometers per hour (65 km / 5 hrs). Since the first motorboat covered a greater distance within the same amount of time, it clearly moved at a higher speed."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to knit. Instead, many people learn how to knit. Knitting well takes practice. So, knitting well is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The ability to knit is not something that individuals are born with; it is a skill that must be learned through practice and experience. Since Elizabeth is good at knitting sweaters, it indicates that she has acquired this skill over time rather than inheriting it genetically. The process of learning and improving in activities like knitting emphasizes that such traits are developed rather than innate. Therefore, this trait is classified as acquired."

The tiger has a large mouth and sharp teeth. Its mouth is adapted to tear through meat.
The nutria has large front teeth. It does not have sharp teeth. So, its mouth is not adapted to tear through meat. The nutria uses its mouth to gnaw on stems and branches."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the tiger because it is a carnivore with a mouth that is specifically adapted to tear through meat, similar to the Nile crocodile mentioned in the text. The tiger has large, sharp teeth designed for grasping and cutting through flesh, making it well-suited for its diet of fish and mammals. In contrast, the nutria has large front teeth that are not sharp and are used primarily for gnawing on plants, which indicates it is not adapted for a carnivorous diet. Thus, the tiger is the correct choice for an animal whose mouth is adapted to tear through meat."

Wind can blow pollen from a male cone to a female cone.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Plants	Describe and construct conifer life cycles	"Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant."	"When pollen lands on a female cone, it is called pollination. This photograph shows wind blowing pollen from the male cones on a Japanese cedar tree.
Photosynthesis happens when plants use water, carbon dioxide, and energy from sunlight to make sugar."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""Pollination"" because the question specifically refers to the process that occurs when pollen lands on a female cone, which is the definition of pollination. The hint provided also clarifies that pollen from male cones is carried by the wind to female cones, reinforcing that the correct term is pollination. Fertilization, while related, occurs later in the reproductive process after pollination has taken place. Photosynthesis is unrelated to the process of pollen transfer and is instead about how plants produce food."

The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Solutions	Diffusion across membranes	"In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal."	"Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there was 1 solute particle on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The text indicates that before equilibrium, there were 1 solute particle on the left and 5 on the right. For the particles to reach equilibrium (3 on each side), additional particles must have moved from the right side to the left side. Since the left side started with fewer particles and ended up with more, it is clear that more solute particles moved to the left than to the right. Thus, the correct choice is (1) to the left than to the right."

While there are many methods and strategies that you can use for reviewing a text, it is generally helpful to frame your suggestions in concrete and constructive ways and to consider the following areas for revision:
Ideas and development: Does the writer express a clear idea and develop it with evidence, examples, or analysis?
Organization: Does the writer order ideas in a clear, logical way so that they build on one another and are easy to follow?
Voice: Does the writer maintain an appropriate voice, such as a formal and objective voice in an academic essay or an engaging and expressive voice in a narrative essay?
Sentence fluency: Does the writer use sentences that vary in structure and length to create a sense of rhythm and flow within and between sentences, or does the writing sound choppy, rambling, or repetitive?
Word choice: Does the writer use words accurately and precisely to create clear, effective, and engaging writing?
Grammar and mechanics: Does the writer follow appropriate conventions, using accurate spelling, punctuation, and grammar to create writing that is correct and easy to read?"	"The writer could best improve his or her grammar and mechanics by punctuating quotations correctly.

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	A firework exploding is a chemical change. During the explosion, the type of matter in the firework changes. This change produces sound, heat, and light.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A firework exploding is considered a chemical change because it involves a reaction between various chemicals that results in the formation of new substances. During the explosion, the chemical compounds in the firework react to produce gases, heat, light, and sound, which are all signs of a chemical reaction. In contrast, a physical change would not alter the chemical composition of the materials involved.

Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 255 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose option (1) because the mountain biker who moved 255 kilometers in 10 hours covered a greater distance in the same amount of time compared to the other biker, who only moved 190 kilometers. Since both bikers traveled for an equal duration of 10 hours, the biker who covered more distance must have been moving at a higher speed. Thus, the comparison clearly indicates that the second biker had a higher speed."

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.

Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that ozone is composed of only one chemical element. So, ozone is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Ozone is composed of three oxygen atoms, which means it is made up of only one type of element—in this case, oxygen. Since it does not consist of different elements combined together, it does not qualify as a compound. Therefore, it is classified as an elementary substance, as it is made entirely of a single chemical element, which is oxygen."

The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the H allele, which is for not having horns, is dominant over the h allele, which is for having horns.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to offspring that have horns is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring that do not have horns. This cross is expected to never produce offspring that have horns."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring that do not have horns to those that do is 4:0 based on the Punnett square analysis. Since the H allele is dominant and results in the phenotype of not having horns, all offspring will inherit at least one dominant allele (H). Therefore, none of the offspring will exhibit the recessive trait (having horns), resulting in a ratio of 4 offspring without horns to 0 offspring with horns. Thus, the most likely ratio is 4:0."

['mammal tooth', 'ginkgo leaf']	1	This diagram shows fossils in an undisturbed sedimentary rock sequence.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Fossils	Compare ages of fossils in a rock sequence	"A fossil is the preserved evidence of an ancient organism. Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The ginkgo leaf fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the mammal tooth fossil. So, the ginkgo leaf fossil is most likely younger than the mammal tooth fossil."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: In sedimentary rock sequences, the principle of superposition states that younger layers are deposited on top of older layers. In this case, the ginkgo leaf fossil is found in a shallower layer compared to the mammal tooth fossil, indicating that it was deposited more recently. Therefore, the ginkgo leaf fossil is most likely younger than the mammal tooth fossil, making choice (1) the correct answer."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	['Emily had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. The operator promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene.', 'Emily had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. They promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene.']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun they is used without its antecedent.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. They has been replaced with the operator.
Emily had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. The operator promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the second choice contains the vague pronoun ""they,"" which does not clearly refer to a specific antecedent. In this context, ""they"" could create confusion about who is being referred to, as it is not clear whether it refers to the operator, the police, or a different group. In contrast, the first choice specifies ""the operator,"" which clarifies the subject performing the action of dispatching the police, thus avoiding any ambiguity."
	Based on this information, what is Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait?	['not having horns', 'having horns']	0	"In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype HH for the horns gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Cheyenne's genotype for the horns gene is HH. Cheyenne's genotype of HH has only H allelles. The H allele is for not having horns. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having horns (H) is dominant over the allele for having horns (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of HH has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Cheyenne's genotype is HH, which consists of two dominant alleles for the horns trait. The dominant allele (H) corresponds to the phenotype of not having horns, while the recessive allele (h) indicates having horns. Since Cheyenne has no recessive alleles, her phenotype must reflect the dominant trait, which is not having horns. Therefore, the correct answer is that Cheyenne does not have horns."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"The air inside a soap bubble is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
The air inside a soap bubble fills all the space in the bubble. If the bubble pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The air inside a soap bubble is indeed a gas, as it fills the entire volume of the bubble and conforms to its shape. Gases have the property of expanding to fill their container, which is exactly what happens within a soap bubble. If the bubble were to pop, the air would disperse and occupy a larger space, further confirming its gaseous state. Thus, the correct choice is (0) a gas."

['a mature fern', 'a heart-shaped plant']	0	This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	"A fertilized egg can grow into a mature fern.
A heart-shaped plant grows from a spore, not from a fertilized egg."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A fertilized egg, in the context of this question, refers to the reproductive stage of a plant that can develop into a mature fern. The mention of ""a heart-shaped plant"" likely refers to the gametophyte stage of a fern's life cycle, which arises from spores rather than fertilized eggs. Therefore, the correct choice is that a fertilized egg can grow into a mature fern, which corresponds to choice (0)."

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the giant anteater.
A tube-shaped snout helps the giant anteater reach into a burrow. A long, sticky tongue helps it catch the insects.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The tamandua has a tube-shaped snout and a long, sticky tongue. Its mouth is adapted to eat insects that live inside burrows.
The kudu has a wide snout. Its mouth is not adapted to get insects out of burrows. The kudu uses its mouth to eat leaves and shoots."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the tamandua (0) because it has a tube-shaped snout and a long, sticky tongue, which are adaptations that allow it to extract insects from burrows, similar to the giant anteater. In contrast, the kudu (1) has a wide snout that is not designed for this purpose; it primarily feeds on leaves and shoots rather than insects. Therefore, the tamandua is the correct choice as it shares the necessary adaptations for reaching and consuming insects from burrows."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
sewing an apron
water evaporating from a lake"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	0		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Sewing an apron is a physical change. The fabric and thread that make up the apron get a new shape, but the type of matter in each of them does not change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But sewing an apron is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Both changes are classified as physical changes since there is no alteration in the chemical composition of the substances involved. Sewing an apron involves reshaping fabric and thread without changing their inherent properties, while water evaporating from a lake is a change of state from liquid to gas, which also retains the same chemical identity. Therefore, the correct choice is that both are only physical changes."

	Which drop of dish soap has more thermal energy?	['the hotter drop of dish soap', 'the colder drop of dish soap']	0	Two drops of dish soap are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two drops of dish soap are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter drop of dish soap has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The hotter drop of dish soap has more thermal energy because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of a substance. Since both drops are identical in mass and material, the only variable affecting their thermal energy is temperature. Therefore, the drop that is hotter possesses greater thermal energy compared to the colder drop. This is a fundamental principle of thermodynamics."

For each one, capitalize the first word and end with a comma. You should also capitalize proper nouns, such as Aunt Sue.
Dear Aunt Sue,
I'm glad you could come to my party, and
thank you for the birthday gift. I could not have
asked for a better one! Every time I see it, I think
of you.

Rory"	"The second greeting is correct:
Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Uncle Brad is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter is ""Dear Uncle Brad,"" as it adheres to the conventions of capitalization and punctuation in formal writing. The first word ""Dear"" is capitalized, which is standard for letter salutations, and ""Uncle Brad"" also follows the rule of capitalizing proper nouns. Additionally, the greeting correctly ends with a comma, which is essential in letter formatting. Therefore, choice (1) is the appropriate selection."

""You Are My Sunshine"""	"A movie should be in italics.
The correct title is **Nothing but the Best**."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying the correct formatting for a movie title, which is typically represented in italics. The option ***Nothing but the Best*** is presented with asterisks, indicating emphasis, but it aligns with the common convention of italicizing titles. In contrast, the first option ""Nothing but the Best"" does not have any special formatting, making it less suitable. Therefore, option 1 is the correct choice as it emphasizes the title as intended for movie titles."
	"Which figure of speech is used in this text?
Ariel, I've told you a million times: you need to dry the dishes before you put them away."	['hyperbole', 'paradox']	0		closed choice	grade11	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Classify the figure of speech: euphemism, hyperbole, oxymoron, paradox	"Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
A euphemism is a polite or indirect expression that is used to de-emphasize an unpleasant topic.
The head of Human Resources would never refer to firing people, only to laying them off.
Hyperbole is an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
I ate so much that I think I might explode!
An oxymoron is a joining of two seemingly contradictory terms.
Some reviewers are calling this book a new classic.
A paradox is a statement that might at first appear to be contradictory, but that may in fact contain some truth.
Always expect the unexpected."	"The text uses hyperbole, an obvious exaggeration that is not meant to be taken literally.
A million times is an exaggeration, since it is unlikely that Ariel has actually been told this a million times."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs hyperbole, as the phrase ""a million times"" is a deliberate exaggeration used to emphasize the speaker's frustration with Ariel's failure to follow instructions. This expression is not meant to be taken literally but serves to convey the intensity of the speaker's feelings. In contrast, a paradox would involve a statement that seems contradictory but reveals a deeper truth, which is not applicable in this case. Therefore, hyperbole is the correct figure of speech used in the text."
	Based on this information, what is Fifi's genotype for the ear type gene?	['normal ears', 'EE']	1	"This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele E is for normal ears, and the allele e is for dumbo ears.
Fifi, a rat from this group, has normal ears. Fifi has two alleles for normal ears."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Fifi has two alleles for normal ears (E). So, Fifi's genotype for the ear type gene is EE.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Fifi has normal ears, which indicates that she has at least one allele for normal ears (E). The passage specifies that Fifi has two alleles for normal ears, which means her genotype must be homozygous dominant, represented as EE. Since the only option that matches this genotype is (1) EE, this is the correct choice for Fifi's genotype regarding the ear type gene."
	Which sentence uses a metaphor?	['The baby fish in the aquarium are as tiny as specks.', 'The baby fish in the aquarium are tiny specks.']	1		closed choice	grade4	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"This sentence uses a metaphor:

The words baby fish and specks are compared without the word like or as.
This sentence uses a simile:
The baby fish in the aquarium are as tiny as specks.
The words baby fish and specks are compared using the word as."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the sentence ""The baby fish in the aquarium are tiny specks"" directly compares baby fish to specks without using the words ""like"" or ""as,"" which is characteristic of a metaphor. In contrast, the first option employs a simile by using ""as"" to make the comparison, clearly indicating that it is not a metaphor.

	Assume all other forces on the cactus are balanced. Which statement describes the forces on the cactus?	['The forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus.', 'The forces are balanced, so there is no net force on the cactus.']	0	Ariana is picking up her potted cactus as she cleans her room. She is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20N. Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15N.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on the cactus, look at the forces:
Ariana is pulling the cactus up with a force of 20 N.
Earth's gravity is pulling the cactus down with a force of 15 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 20 N and 15 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on the cactus."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The forces acting on the cactus are unbalanced because Ariana's upward force of 20 N is greater than the downward force of gravity, which is 15 N. Since the magnitudes of the forces differ and are acting in opposite directions, this results in a net force acting on the cactus. Therefore, the correct statement is that the forces are unbalanced, leading to a net force on the cactus."

To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside."	Mom was lost in Morristown she asked someone for directions is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined without end punctuation: Mom was lost in Morristown and She asked someone for directions.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mom was lost in Morristown she asked someone for directions"" is considered a run-on sentence because it improperly combines two independent clauses without appropriate punctuation or a coordinating conjunction. The first clause, ""Mom was lost in Morristown,"" and the second clause, ""she asked someone for directions,"" can stand alone as complete sentences. In contrast, the other choice, ""In the story, a giant hid a bag of gold and jewels,"" is a complete and grammatically correct sentence."

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because a consumer is defined as an organism that obtains its energy by eating other organisms. In the context of the food chain mentioned, the brown trout consumes midge larva, which clearly categorizes it as a consumer. The other option, which states that it makes its own food, describes producers like plants, not consumers like the brown trout. Thus, the correct choice is that it eats another organism."

During this reaction, thermal energy is taken in from the surroundings and converted to chemical energy.The underlined text tells you that thermal energy is taken in from the surroundings. Because thermal energy moves out of the surroundings and into the reaction, the temperature of the surroundings decreases.The surroundings include the air around the reaction. So, the air around the reaction becomes colder.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The passage states that during the chemical reaction, thermal energy is absorbed from the surroundings, which indicates that the reaction is endothermic. As a result, the temperature of the surroundings, including the air around the reaction, decreases. Therefore, the air around the reaction becomes colder, leading to the choice of (0) colder as the correct answer."

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question asks whether the magnets will attract or repel each other based on their orientation. Since the north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet, they will attract each other, as opposite poles attract. This is a fundamental property of magnets, where like poles repel and opposite poles attract. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnets will attract."

SOLUTION: The argument presented states that Mr. Leonard can quit smoking because he is capable of stopping, which effectively rephrases the initial claim without providing any new evidence or reasoning. This is a classic example of circular reasoning, where the conclusion is simply restated as the premise. In this case, the argument does not advance beyond the assertion that he can quit, failing to establish a valid basis for why he can do so. Thus, the correct identification of the fallacy is circular reasoning."

"	"The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses conversational language (real quick).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the conversational language, so it is more formal overall."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose option 0 because it employs more formal language by using ""responding quickly"" instead of the colloquial phrase ""responding real quick."" The phrase ""real quick"" is informal and conversational, making option 1 less suitable for a formal context. Additionally, option 0 maintains a professional tone, which is appropriate for business communication, whereas option 1's choice of words detracts from that level of formality."
	How long is a long-distance running race?	['23 yards', '23 miles']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of a long-distance running race is 23 miles.
23 yards is too short."	"ANSWER: 23 miles  
SOLUTION: A long-distance running race typically refers to events such as marathons, which are 26.2 miles, or other races that exceed standard distances like 5K or 10K. Given the options provided, 23 miles is a more accurate representation of the long-distance category compared to 23 yards, which is an extremely short distance and not classified as long-distance running. Thus, 23 miles is the better estimate for such races."

['repel', 'attract']	0	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The analysis of the magnets shows that the north pole of one magnet is facing the north pole of the other magnet. Since like poles repel each other, the two north poles will push away from one another. Therefore, the magnets will repel each other rather than attract, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is (0) repel."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.

500 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 500 grams  
SOLUTION: A full box of cereal typically weighs around 500 grams, which is a common size for consumer products in the cereal category. In contrast, 500 kilograms is excessively heavy and unrealistic for a box of cereal, as it would be impractical for storage and consumption. Therefore, 500 grams is the better estimate, as it aligns with standard packaging sizes in grocery stores."

The comic book superhero Spider-Man possesses a spidey sense that warns him of impending trouble.
The allusion spidey sense means a sense of danger coming."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""spidey sense"" originates from comic books, specifically those featuring the superhero Spider-Man. This term refers to Spider-Man's heightened sense of danger, which alerts him to threats before they occur. The context in the sentence implies that Justin is experiencing a similar instinctive awareness of danger, drawing a direct connection to the superhero narrative found in comic books.

SOLUTION: The Alexandrine parakeet has a thick hooked beak, which is specifically adapted to crack large, hard nuts, similar to the military macaw. In contrast, the western kingbird has a straight, thin beak that is not suitable for cracking nuts, as it is designed for catching insects.

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The question asks to compare the average kinetic energies of particles in two gas samples with identical conditions. Since the particles in both samples have the same mass and average speed, their average kinetic energies must also be equal. Consequently, since the temperature of a gas is directly related to its average kinetic energy, both samples must have the same temperature. Thus, the correct choice is that neither sample has a higher temperature; they are the same."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
water evaporating from a lake
ice crystals forming on a window"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	2		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Water evaporating from a lake is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Ice crystals forming on a window is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Water vapor in the air can change directly into ice when it touches a very cold window! A change of state from a gas to a solid is called depositing.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Water evaporating is caused by heating. But ice crystals forming on a window is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Ice crystals form on a window when water vapor in the air becomes ice. This is caused by cooling. But water evaporating from a lake is not."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Both changes are physical changes, as they involve a change of state without the formation of new substances. Water evaporating from a lake transforms from a liquid to a gas, while ice crystals forming on a window is the result of water vapor changing directly into a solid. Neither process involves a chemical reaction, so the correct choice is that both are only physical changes."
	Based on this information, what is Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait?	['a reddish-brown coat', 'a black coat']	1	"In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Lady is a horse from this group. Lady has the heterozygous genotype Ll for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait. First, consider the alleles in Lady's genotype for the coat color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Lady's genotype of Ll has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Lady's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Lady's genotype is Ll, where L represents the dominant allele for a black coat and l represents the recessive allele for a reddish-brown coat. Since the presence of at least one dominant allele (L) determines the phenotype, Lady will exhibit the trait associated with the dominant allele. Therefore, her phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat, as the dominant trait masks the effect of the recessive trait."

However, even though his uncle couldn't be trusted with money, that doesn't necessarily mean that Porter can't be trusted with it. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs the logical fallacy of guilt by association, as it attempts to discredit Porter by linking him to his uncle's criminal behavior. This fallacy suggests that because Porter's uncle was involved in embezzlement, Porter himself is also untrustworthy with money, despite there being no direct evidence to support this claim.

Radon is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	0	Radon is a gas that can cause lung cancer if it is breathed in large quantities. The chemical formula for radon is Rn.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether radon is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for radon is Rn. This formula contains one symbol: Rn. So, the formula tells you that radon is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, radon is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because radon is represented by the chemical symbol Rn, which indicates that it is a single element rather than a combination of elements. The presence of only one symbol in its chemical formula confirms that radon is not a compound, which would require multiple symbols to denote different elements. Therefore, radon qualifies as an elementary substance, as it is solely composed of one type of atom."

"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose sample A as having the higher temperature because the particles in sample A possess a higher average kinetic energy compared to those in sample B. The increased mass of the particles in sample A, combined with their higher average speed, leads to greater kinetic energy as defined by the equation KE = 1/2 mv². Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, sample A's higher kinetic energy directly indicates a higher temperature than that of sample B."
	How long is a hammer?	['19 meters', '19 centimeters', '19 kilometers', '19 millimeters']	1	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance, mass, and volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a hammer is 19 centimeters.
19 millimeters is too short. 19 meters and 19 kilometers are too long."	"ANSWER: 19 centimeters  
SOLUTION: A standard hammer typically ranges in length from about 30 to 35 centimeters, making 19 centimeters a reasonable estimate for a smaller hammer, such as a claw hammer or a framing hammer when considering variations in size. The other options, such as 19 millimeters, are too short, while 19 meters and 19 kilometers are excessively long for any type of hammer. Therefore, 19 centimeters is the most appropriate choice based on common hammer sizes."

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele A is for having agouti fur, and the allele a is for not having agouti fur.
Kitkat, a cat from this group, has agouti fur. Kitkat has one allele for having agouti fur and one allele for not having agouti fur."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Kitkat's observable version of the agouti fur trait is having agouti fur. So, Kitkat's phenotype for the agouti fur trait is having agouti fur.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Kitkat's phenotype for the agouti fur trait is defined as the observable version of that trait, which in this case is having agouti fur. The information provided indicates that Kitkat possesses one allele for having agouti fur (A) and one for not having it (a). Since the presence of the dominant allele (A) results in the observable trait of agouti fur, Kitkat's phenotype is clearly ""having agouti fur."" Thus, the correct choice is 1."

You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	"In this experiment, Bernard investigated whether adding soap to water affects how much water can fit on a penny. So, the pennies with soapy water were part of an experimental group.
The pennies with pure water did not get soapy water. So, they were not part of an experimental group."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The experimental group in this experiment consisted of the pennies that were tested with water mixed with hand soap, as Bernard aimed to investigate the effect of soap on the water's ability to form a dome on a penny. In contrast, the pennies with pure water served as a control group, which means they were not part of the experimental group.

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each ship moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each ship moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each ship moved for 5 hours. The ship that moved 210 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that ship must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which ship was moving at the highest speed, we calculate the speed of each ship by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. All ships traveled for the same duration of 5 hours. The speeds are as follows: Ship 0 (165 miles / 5 hours = 33 miles/hour), Ship 1 (210 miles / 5 hours = 42 miles/hour), and Ship 2 (75 miles / 5 hours = 15 miles/hour).

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The explanation provided indicates that the size of the magnets affects the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. In Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than Magnet B in Pair 2, which leads to a smaller magnetic force in Pair 1 compared to Pair 2. While both pairs can either attract or repel, this only influences the direction of the force, not its magnitude.

An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait. First, consider the alleles in Jack's genotype for the cheek color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for bright orange cheeks (R) is dominant over the allele for pale orange cheeks (r). This means R is a dominant allele, and r is a recessive allele.
Jack's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jack's phenotype for the cheek color trait must be bright orange cheeks."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Jack has a heterozygous genotype of Rr for the cheek color trait, where R (the allele for bright orange cheeks) is dominant over r (the allele for pale orange cheeks). Since he possesses one dominant allele (R), he will express the dominant phenotype, which is bright orange cheeks. Thus, despite having one recessive allele, the presence of the dominant allele determines Jack's phenotype as bright orange cheeks."

SOLUTION: The Peary Land ecosystem is accurately described by the first choice, which states that it has long, cold winters and mostly small plants. This aligns with the characteristics of tundra ecosystems, which are known for their extreme cold and limited plant diversity, primarily consisting of low-lying vegetation. In contrast, the second choice mentions many trees and shrubs, which do not typically thrive in tundra environments due to the harsh climate and permafrost conditions. Thus, the first option is the better description of the Peary Land ecosystem."

This color is yellow. The wet paint and the jello are not yellow.
A scratchy object is rough and itchy against your skin. The wet paint and the jello are not scratchy.
The property that all three objects have in common is slippery."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""slippery"" because, upon examining each object, they all share the characteristic of being difficult to hold onto or stand on due to their slick surfaces. The options ""yellow"" and ""scratchy"" do not apply to all three objects; only one is yellow, and the others are not scratchy.

	"What do these two changes have in common?
burning a candle
melting glass"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	2		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Melting glass is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The glass changes from solid to liquid. But a different type of matter is not formed.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Melting glass is a physical change. But burning a candle is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. But melting glass is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Both burning a candle and melting glass are processes that involve heating. Burning a candle requires heat to initiate the combustion of wax and wick, resulting in a chemical change. Similarly, melting glass involves applying heat to transition it from a solid to a liquid state, which is a physical change. Therefore, the commonality between the two changes is that both are caused by heating."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each sailboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each sailboat moved for 5 hours. The sailboat that moved 35 kilometers moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: To determine which sailboat was moving at the lowest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each sailboat based on the distance traveled and the time taken. All three sailboats traveled for the same amount of time (5 hours), so we can simply compare the distances. The first sailboat traveled 80 kilometers, the second 40 kilometers, and the third 35 kilometers. The third sailboat, which moved 35 kilometers, had the lowest distance traveled in the same time frame, indicating it had the lowest speed."

The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase sang in. It describes the wind as if it were a singer.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the phrase ""sang in"" because it attributes a human quality to the wind, suggesting that it can produce music or sounds akin to singing. This is a clear example of personification, as it gives the wind an action typically associated with living beings. In contrast, ""rushed by"" does not imply any human-like qualities and simply describes the movement of the wind without emotional or artistic connotations. Thus, ""sang in"" effectively enhances the imagery and emotional impact of the sentence."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury"	The ad appeals to ethos, or character, by emphasizing the quality standards that are part of the brand's identity.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The ad emphasizes the brand's quality standards, which reflect the character and credibility of the company. By highlighting the trustworthiness and reputation of the brand, it appeals to ethos, as it seeks to establish a connection with the audience based on the brand's integrity. This approach is designed to persuade consumers by fostering confidence in the brand's values and commitment to quality. Therefore, ethos is the primary rhetorical appeal used in this ad."

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mr. Kramer will coach the girls' basketball team"" is in the future tense, as indicated by the use of the word ""will"" before the verb ""coach."" This construction is a clear marker of future tense, signifying an action that is planned or expected to occur later. The verb ""coach"" itself is in its base form, which is typical when forming the future tense with ""will."" Thus, the correct choice is future tense, corresponding to option (0)."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Sample B has particles with both greater mass and higher average speed compared to the particles in sample A. Since kinetic energy is dependent on both mass and the square of velocity (KE = 1/2 mv²), the combination of these two factors results in a higher average kinetic energy for the particles in sample B. Consequently, because temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, sample B exhibits a higher temperature than sample A."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

4 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 4

SOLUTION: A large soup pot typically has a volume that ranges from several liters to over 10 liters, making 4 liters a reasonable estimate for its capacity. In contrast, 4 milliliters is an extremely small volume, far too little for any typical cooking pot, let alone a large one. Therefore, 4 liters is the better choice as it aligns more closely with real-world expectations for the size of a large soup pot."

Pre-owned is an indirect way of saying used."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs a euphemism with the phrase ""certified pre-owned,"" which is a more palatable way of referring to ""used cars."" This choice of wording softens the potentially negative connotation associated with buying a used vehicle. By using ""pre-owned,"" the dealership aims to make the cars sound more appealing, indicating that they are in good condition and adding an element of certification, which further enhances their value in the eyes of consumers.

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two glasses of orange juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 70°F glass of orange juice is hotter than the 45°F glass of orange juice, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The 250-gram glass of orange juice at 70°F has more thermal energy than the one at 45°F because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Since both glasses have the same mass, the one at the higher temperature (70°F) contains more kinetic energy within its molecules, resulting in greater thermal energy. Consequently, the difference in temperature indicates that the 70°F glass has a higher thermal energy content compared to the 45°F glass."

Calcarenite is a rock.
Burlap is made by humans. But rocks are not made by living things.
So, burlap is not a rock.

SOLUTION: I chose burlap as the answer because it is a man-made material, whereas the other options, chert and calcarenite, are natural substances that qualify as rocks. Rocks are typically defined as solid aggregates of minerals or mineraloid matter that occur naturally. Since burlap is produced by humans and does not occur naturally, it does not fit the definition of a rock."

"Look at the distance each speedboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each speedboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each speedboat moved for 5 hours. The speedboat that moved 395 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that speedboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: To determine which speedboat was moving at the highest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each speedboat by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. All three speedboats traveled for the same duration of 5 hours. The speedboat that moved 395 kilometers west has the highest distance, and thus, its speed is 395 km / 5 h = 79 km/h. In comparison, the other speedboats traveled shorter distances, resulting in lower speeds. Therefore, the speedboat that moved 395 kilometers must have been moving at the highest speed."

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The magnetic force's strength is influenced by the distance between the magnets; as they move farther apart, the force diminishes. In this case, Pair 1 has magnets that are positioned farther apart compared to those in Pair 2. Therefore, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is weaker than in Pair 2, making statement (1) correct.

SOLUTION: I chose Solution A because it has a higher number of blue particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. The concentration of a solution is determined by the ratio of solute (blue particles) to the volume of solvent. In this case, since the analysis indicates that Solution A contains more blue particles per milliliter, it confirms that Solution A has a higher concentration of blue particles than Solution B."
	Last year, there were seven men's clothing stores on Main Street in Newport. This year, there are only three. What probably happened to the overall supply of men's shirts in Newport?	['The supply probably went down.', 'The supply probably went up.']	0		closed choice	grade4	social science	economics	Supply and demand	Understand overall supply and demand	"Overall supply is the total amount of a good or service that producers make and sell. There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The closure of four men's clothing stores on Main Street indicates a reduction in the number of suppliers for men's shirts in Newport. With fewer stores available to sell these items, the overall supply of men's shirts likely decreased. This reduction in supply would mean that there are less options and availability for consumers, leading to the conclusion that the supply probably went down."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than those in Pair 1, which results in a greater magnetic force due to the inverse relationship between distance and force magnitude. Although the magnets in Pair 1 repel and those in Pair 2 attract, the direction of the force does not influence its magnitude. Therefore, since the distance is smaller in Pair 2, the conclusion is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."
	Based on this information, what is this bitter melon plant's phenotype for the seed color trait?	['DD', 'dark brown seeds']	1	"In a group of bitter melon plants, some individuals have dark brown seeds and others have light brown seeds. In this group, the gene for the seed color trait has two alleles. The allele D is for dark brown seeds, and the allele d is for light brown seeds.
A certain bitter melon plant from this group has dark brown seeds. This plant has two alleles for dark brown seeds."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The bitter melon plant's observable version of the seed color trait is dark brown seeds. So, the plant's phenotype for the seed color trait is dark brown seeds.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question asks for the phenotype of the bitter melon plant regarding the seed color trait. Given that the plant has dark brown seeds and carries two alleles for dark brown seeds (DD), its observable characteristic for seed color is dark brown. Therefore, the correct choice that represents this phenotype is ""dark brown seeds,"" which corresponds to option (1). This aligns with the definition of phenotype as the observable expression of a trait."

SOLUTION: I chose the red-handed tamarin because, like the vervet monkey, it has long fingers and toes that are specifically adapted for climbing trees. This anatomical feature allows it to grip branches effectively, making it well-suited for a tree-dwelling lifestyle. In contrast, the kiwi has short toes and small wings, which do not support climbing, indicating that it is not adapted for this environment.

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to play basketball. Instead, some people learn how to play basketball. Playing the sport takes practice. So, playing basketball is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The ability to play basketball is not something that is inherited genetically; rather, it is a skill that individuals learn through practice, training, and experience. While some may have natural athleticism or physical attributes that can aid in playing sports, the actual skill of playing basketball requires instruction and effort to develop.

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose answer 1 because the analysis indicates that the particles in sample B not only have more mass but also possess a higher average speed compared to those in sample A. In thermodynamics, the average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to temperature; thus, the higher average kinetic energy of sample B signifies that it must have a higher temperature. Therefore, since sample B's particles are more energetic, it confirms that sample B has the higher temperature."

You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	"In this experiment, Jennifer investigated whether storing bread in dark bins affects mold growth. So, the loaves of bread in bins covered with dark paper were part of an experimental group.
The loaves of bread in bins with no covering were not stored in dark bins. So, they were not part of an experimental group."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The experimental group in this experiment consisted of the loaves of bread in bins covered with dark paper, as they were subjected to the variable being tested—storage in dark conditions. The loaves of bread in bins with no covering were part of the control group, as they were not exposed to the same condition. Therefore, they did not participate in the experimental manipulation regarding mold growth, which was the focus of Jennifer's investigation.

The spiny orb-weaver has a red, white, and black body. It is not adapted to be camouflaged among green leaves."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the green mantis because it has a green body, which allows it to blend in with the green leaves in its environment, providing effective camouflage. This adaptation helps it avoid predators and enhances its ability to hunt for prey. In contrast, the spiny orb-weaver, with its red, white, and black coloration, does not blend in with green leaves, making it less effective in camouflage compared to the green mantis. Thus, the green mantis is the correct choice for an animal adapted to camouflage among green leaves."
	Based on this information, what is this fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait?	['red eyes', 'EE']	0	"In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have red eyes and others have brown eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele E is for red eyes, and the allele e is for brown eyes.
A certain fruit fly from this group has red eyes. This fly has two alleles for red eyes."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The fruit fly's observable version of the eye color trait is red eyes. So, the fly's phenotype for the eye color trait is red eyes.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The fruit fly in question has red eyes, which corresponds to the observable phenotype of the eye color trait. Since the text specifies that the fly has two alleles for red eyes, it indicates a homozygous dominant genotype (EE). However, in the context of the question regarding phenotype, the correct choice is the observable trait, which is red eyes. Thus, the correct answer is (0) red eyes."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will attract each other because the north pole of one magnet is positioned near the south pole of the other. According to the fundamental principles of magnetism, opposite poles (north and south) attract each other, while like poles (north and north or south and south) repel.

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of a sofa is 7 feet.
7 yards is too long."	"ANSWER: 7

SOLUTION: A standard sofa is typically around 6 to 8 feet in length, making 7 feet a more reasonable estimate than 7 yards, which is equivalent to 21 feet. The choice of 7 feet aligns well with common dimensions found in furniture design, whereas 7 yards exceeds the typical size for a residential sofa. Therefore, 7 feet is the better estimate for the length of a sofa in most settings."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
cooking an egg
salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	0		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Cooking an egg is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the egg to change. Cooked egg and raw egg are different types of matter.
Salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is a chemical change. The salt and vinegar change the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. This makes the penny look shiny again.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But salt and vinegar removing tarnish from a penny is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Both cooking an egg and using salt and vinegar to remove tarnish from a penny are chemical changes because they result in the formation of new substances. In the case of the egg, heat causes the proteins to denature and form a solid structure, distinguishing cooked eggs from raw ones. Similarly, the reaction between salt, vinegar, and tarnish transforms the tarnish into a different substance that can be wiped away, restoring the penny's shine. Therefore, the correct choice is that both processes are chemical changes."

Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.

SOLUTION: Hydrogen sulfide consists of two different chemical elements: hydrogen (H) and sulfur (S). Since it is formed by the bonding of these two elements, it qualifies as a compound rather than an elementary substance. An elementary substance consists of only one type of element, whereas a compound is made up of two or more elements combined together. Therefore, the correct choice is that hydrogen sulfide is a compound."

SOLUTION: Heating water in a microwave is classified as a physical change because the process only alters the temperature and state of the water without changing its chemical composition. The water molecules may gain energy and move faster, resulting in an increase in temperature, but they remain H2O molecules throughout the process.

	Which helium balloon has more thermal energy?	['the hotter helium balloon', 'the colder helium balloon']	0	Two helium balloons are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two helium balloons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter helium balloon has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature; as the temperature increases, so does the thermal energy. Since the two helium balloons are identical in all aspects except for their temperatures, the hotter balloon will have a higher average kinetic energy of its gas molecules, resulting in greater thermal energy. Therefore, the hotter helium balloon has more thermal energy compared to the colder one."

SOLUTION: The text presents an argument based on a single week's experience of no rain in Seattle, concluding that the city's reputation for being rainy is false. This is a classic example of hasty generalization, as the author draws a broad conclusion about Seattle's overall climate based on insufficient evidence – just one week's weather.

A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the eye color gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the eye color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for brown eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The fruit fly has a heterozygous genotype of Ee for the eye color gene, where E represents the dominant allele for red eyes and e represents the recessive allele for brown eyes. Since the presence of at least one dominant allele (E) results in the expression of the dominant phenotype, this fruit fly will display the trait associated with the dominant allele, which is red eyes. Therefore, the phenotype of the fruit fly is red eyes, corresponding to choice (0)."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	All three glasses of apple juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 20°C glass of apple juice is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The three glasses of apple juice are identical in mass, which means their thermal energy is primarily determined by their temperatures. The glass at 20°C has the highest temperature compared to the other two glasses, which are at 12°C and 7°C respectively. Since thermal energy increases with temperature, the 20°C glass has the most thermal energy among the three options. Therefore, the correct choice is option (1)."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Sample B has particles with greater mass compared to the particles in sample A, and while both samples have the same average speed, the kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass. Since the average kinetic energy is higher for the particles in sample B due to their greater mass, sample B must have a higher temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is that sample B has the higher temperature."

SOLUTION: The phenotype of an organism refers to its observable characteristics, which in this case is the flower color of the scarlet rosemallow plant. Given that the plant has red flowers, this observable trait corresponds to the dominant allele F for red flowers.

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The wood fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the mammal tooth fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely younger than the mammal tooth fossil."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: In the analysis of the rock sequence, the position of the fossils is key to determining their relative ages. Since the wood fossil is located in a shallower layer compared to the mammal tooth fossil, it indicates that the wood was deposited more recently, making it younger. This follows the principle of superposition, which states that in an undisturbed sequence of sedimentary rocks, older layers are found below younger layers. Thus, the wood fossil is the more likely answer for the younger fossil."

Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""chemical change"" because rusting involves a chemical reaction between iron and oxygen in the presence of moisture, resulting in a new substance, iron oxide (rust). This process alters the properties of the original metal, making it different from its initial state. Unlike physical changes, which do not involve the formation of new substances, rusting is irreversible under normal conditions, further confirming it as a chemical change."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
compost rotting
burning a candle"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Compost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Burning is caused by heating. But compost rotting is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: Both compost rotting and burning a candle involve chemical changes, as they result in the transformation of substances into different materials. In the case of compost, the organic matter breaks down into simpler compounds through microbial activity, while burning a candle involves the combustion of wax and wick, producing soot, carbon dioxide, and water. This commonality in the nature of the changes—transformations at the molecular level—leads to the conclusion that both processes are indeed chemical changes."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

The top layers press down on the bottom layers, squeezing out water and air. Shale forms when the bottom layers of mud are pressed together to form rock."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Shale is classified as a sedimentary rock because it forms through the accumulation and compaction of sediment, specifically layers of mud. The process described involves layers being pressed together over time, which is characteristic of sedimentary rock formation. Additionally, the presence of fossils within shale further supports its classification as sedimentary, as these rocks often contain remnants of living organisms that were preserved within the sediment.

Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: Both changes involve a transformation of substances at a molecular level, indicating that they are chemical changes. The browning of a banana occurs due to a reaction with oxygen, altering its chemical composition, while cells breaking down sugar also results in new substances being formed, such as carbon dioxide and water. Since both processes fundamentally change the matter involved, the correct choice is that both are chemical changes."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy because, although both samples have the same average speed, the particles in sample A are more massive. Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and velocity, and since the velocity is the same for both samples, the greater mass in sample A results in higher kinetic energy. Consequently, a higher average kinetic energy correlates with a higher temperature, indicating that sample A has the higher temperature compared to sample B."

A bathtub is not a living thing.
Bathtubs do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow or respond to their environment. They do not need food or water."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose option 1, piranha, because it is the only living thing among the choices provided. Piranhas exhibit characteristics of life, such as growth, response to their environment, and the need for food and water. In contrast, the other options—tractor, brick wall, and bathtub—do not possess these traits, as they do not grow, need sustenance, or respond to environmental changes.

An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. The cucumber plant's observable version of the fruit texture trait is smooth fruit. So, the plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait is smooth fruit.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The cucumber plant in question has smooth fruit, which is the observable version of the fruit texture trait. Given that the plant has two alleles for smooth fruit, it must have the genotype ""ff,"" which corresponds to the phenotype of smooth fruit. The presence of the allele ""f"" indicates that the plant exhibits the smooth fruit characteristic, as it is the recessive trait in this scenario. Therefore, the correct phenotype for the fruit texture trait of this cucumber plant is smooth fruit."

All three marbles have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 76°F marble is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The marble at a temperature of 76°F has the highest thermal energy among the three options because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Although all marbles are identical in mass, the one with the highest temperature (76°F) contains more kinetic energy in its molecules compared to the other marbles at lower temperatures (70°F and 0°F).

SOLUTION: A news magazine typically weighs around 8 ounces, which is a reasonable estimate considering its usual paper quality and thickness. The options of 8 pounds and 8 tons are excessively heavy for a single magazine; 8 pounds would be more akin to a stack of several magazines, while 8 tons is far beyond any practical weight for such a publication.

All three marbles have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 4°C marble is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature; cooler objects possess less thermal energy than warmer ones. In this case, the marble at 4°C has the lowest temperature among the three marbles, which means it has the least thermal energy.

In a group of humans, some individuals have Huntington's disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Huntington's disease trait has two alleles. The allele for not having Huntington's disease (h) is recessive to the allele for having Huntington's disease (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two humans."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have Huntington's disease, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for not having Huntington's disease, is recessive to the H allele, which is for having Huntington's disease.
Not having Huntington's disease is the recessive allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the recessive version of the Huntington's disease trait must have only recessive alleles for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that do not have Huntington's disease must have the genotype hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
Having Huntington's disease is the dominant allele's version of the Huntington's disease trait. A human with the dominant version of the Huntington's disease trait must have at least one dominant allele for the Huntington's disease gene. So, offspring that have Huntington's disease must have the genotype HH or Hh.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype HH or Hh. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to offspring that have Huntington's disease is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring that do not have Huntington's disease for every 2 offspring that have Huntington's disease."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to those that do have it is 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. However, since the task specifically asks for the ratio of offspring that do not have Huntington's disease to those that do, the correct interpretation aligns with the provided options. Thus, the answer is that for every two offspring that do not have Huntington's disease, there are also two that do, leading to a 1:1 ratio, which corresponds to the answer choice 0 (2:2)."

The other choices, such as barren-ground caribou, bear sedge, and lichen, do not have any pathways leading from the bilberry, indicating that they do not contain matter derived from it."
	Which text uses the word terribly in its traditional sense?	['Zach shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.', 'Zach shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.']	0		closed choice	grade12	language science	writing-strategies	Word usage and nuance	Explore words with new or contested usages	"Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Zach shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Zach shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second text uses ""terribly"" in its traditional sense by describing the slope as ""terribly steep,"" which implies that it is steep in a terrible manner, aligning with the original definition of the word. In contrast, the first text employs ""terribly"" to emphasize Zach's shivering, using it in a nontraditional sense to mean ""very"" or ""extremely."" This distinction illustrates the varying contexts in which ""terribly"" can be interpreted, with the second option adhering more closely to the word's traditional usage."
	Which is the scratchiest?	['bark', 'nylon swim shorts', 'metal flute']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Materials	Compare properties of materials	"Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it."	"Scratchy is a property. A scratchy material is rough and itchy against your skin.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine touching the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the bark is the scratchiest. If you could touch this tree bark, it would feel rough and itchy."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose bark as the scratchiest material because it is typically rough and textured, which can cause irritation to the skin when touched. In contrast, nylon swim shorts are smooth and designed for comfort, while a metal flute has a hard, cold surface that does not typically induce a scratchy sensation. Therefore, when considering the tactile experience of each option, bark stands out as the most likely to feel rough and itchy."

Picking up a paper clip with a magnet is a ()."	['chemical change', 'physical change']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Picking up a paper clip with a magnet is a physical change. The paper clip sticks to the magnet, but it is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The process of picking up a paper clip with a magnet is classified as a physical change because it involves a change in the position of the paper clip without altering its chemical composition. The magnet exerts a magnetic force that causes the paper clip to adhere to it, but the material of the paper clip remains unchanged. In contrast, a chemical change would involve a transformation into a different substance or material. Therefore, the correct answer is a physical change."
	Based on this information, what is Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait?	['a reddish-brown coat', 'a black coat']	1	"In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Dasher is a horse from this group. Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Dasher's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Dasher's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dasher's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Dasher's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Dasher has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene, where L represents the dominant allele for a black coat. Since the black coat allele (L) is dominant over the reddish-brown coat allele (l), having two L alleles (LL) means Dasher will express the dominant phenotype. Therefore, Dasher's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. But the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 and in Pair 2 is the same.
So, the strength of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The hint indicates that the distance between the magnets in both pairs is the same, which is a critical factor in determining the strength of the magnetic force. Since all magnets are made of the same material, their intrinsic magnetic properties remain constant across pairs. Therefore, the strength of the magnetic force must be the same in both pairs, leading to the conclusion that option (1) is the correct statement."

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Danny will let Susan know if he winds up attending Adam's performance."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""he"" could refer to either Danny or Adam, leading to ambiguity in the sentence. In contrast, the first answer choice clarifies who is being referred to by structuring the sentence differently, ensuring that it is clear that Danny is the one who will inform Susan. The confusion arises from the placement of the pronoun in relation to the nouns, which is resolved in the first choice. Thus, choice (1) is the correct answer as it explicitly showcases the vague reference issue."

5 ounces is too light and 5 tons is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""5 pounds"" because it is the most realistic estimate for the mass of a full bag of groceries. A typical bag of groceries usually weighs between 3 to 10 pounds, depending on the items purchased. The option ""5 ounces"" is too light for a full bag, while ""5 tons"" is excessively heavy and impractical for grocery shopping. Therefore, 5 pounds is the most appropriate choice among the given options."

There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage."	"At the current price, there are too many bunk beds for sale. There are 20 beds for sale, but only 15 people want to buy one.
So, there is a surplus of bunk beds. The furniture store will not get any money for the leftover bunk beds."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: There is a surplus of bunk beds because the furniture store has 20 bunk beds available for sale, but only 15 people are interested in purchasing one. This indicates that the supply exceeds the demand, as there are 5 more beds than there are buyers. Consequently, the store will have leftover inventory that they will not sell, confirming the presence of a surplus in this scenario."

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	A pipe cleaner is a solid. You can easily bend a pipe cleaner. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A pipe cleaner is classified as a solid because it maintains a definite shape and volume. Although it is flexible and can be bent into various forms, it does not flow like a liquid or expand to fill a container like a gas. The physical characteristics of a pipe cleaner, such as its ability to hold its shape when not being manipulated, further confirm its classification as a solid."

Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Echo's observable version of the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita. So, Echo's phenotype for the myotonia congenita trait is not having myotonia congenita.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Echo does not have myotonia congenita, which indicates that her observable trait for this condition is the absence of it. Given that she has two alleles for not having myotonia congenita (mm), this clearly aligns with the phenotype of not exhibiting the trait. Therefore, the correct answer is choice (0), which corresponds to not having myotonia congenita."
	Select the elementary substance.	['sulfur dioxide (SO2)', 'neon (Ne)', 'fluoromethanol (CH3FO)']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Identify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	Look at the chemical formula for each substance, and count the number of symbols in the formula. Then, decide if the substance is an elementary substance. The chemical formula for sulfur dioxide contains two symbols: S for sulfur and O for oxygen. So, sulfur dioxide is made of two chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, sulfur dioxide is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for fluoromethanol contains four symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, F for fluorine, and O for oxygen. So, fluoromethanol is made of four chemical elements bonded together. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, fluoromethanol is a compound, not an elementary substance. The chemical formula for neon contains one symbol: Ne. So, neon is made of one chemical element. Substances that are made of one chemical element are elementary substances. So, neon is an elementary substance.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose neon (Ne) as the elementary substance because it is represented by a single chemical symbol, indicating that it consists of only one type of atom. In contrast, both sulfur dioxide (SO2) and fluoromethanol (CH3FO) contain multiple symbols, which means they are composed of more than one element and are therefore classified as compounds. Elementary substances are defined as substances that consist solely of one type of element, making neon the only correct choice among the options provided."

For each object, decide if it has that property.
An opaque object does not let light through. All four objects are opaque.
A hard object does not change shape when pressed or squeezed. The road, the water slide, and the crayons are hard, but the track suit is not.
A flexible object can be folded or bent without breaking easily. The track suit is flexible, but the road and the crayons are not.
The property that all four objects have in common is opaque."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""opaque"" as the answer because, after evaluating each object's properties, it is clear that all four objects do not allow light to pass through them. The road, water slide, crayons, and track suit are all characterized as opaque, meeting the requirement of the common property. In contrast, while the road, water slide, and crayons are hard, and the track suit is flexible, these characteristics do not apply universally to all four objects, making ""opaque"" the best choice."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Most humans are born with five fingers on each hand. So, having five fingers is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The trait of having five fingers on each hand is commonly observed in humans and is a characteristic that is determined genetically. Since Patty was born with five fingers, it indicates that this trait is passed down from parents to offspring through genetic inheritance. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are developed due to environmental factors or personal experiences, which does not apply in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is that having five fingers is an inherited trait."

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The second holiday greeting is more formal. It uses more elevated language (Independence Day, the entire staff). The other holiday greeting uses casual language (happy 4 th, the crew) that is more familiar in tone.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second holiday greeting is more formal as it employs a more sophisticated choice of words, referring to ""Independence Day"" instead of the casual ""4th"" and addressing the message as being from ""the entire staff"" rather than just ""the crew."" This choice of language conveys a sense of professionalism and respect, making it more suitable for formal occasions. Additionally, phrases like ""best wishes for an enjoyable"" contribute to a more courteous tone, contrasting with the informal tone of the first greeting."

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are oriented with like poles facing one another. In this case, the south pole of one magnet is positioned near the south pole of the other magnet. According to the principles of magnetism, like poles repel each other, which confirms that these magnets will not attract but instead push away from each other."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	All three cookies have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 29°C cookie is the hottest, it has the most thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The task requires identifying which object has the most thermal energy based on their temperatures. Since thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, the cookie at 29°C has the highest thermal energy among the three options provided.

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The magnetic force between the magnets depends on their sizes and shapes. Since Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, the difference in magnetic force comes from the size of Magnet B. In Pair 1, Magnet B is larger than in Pair 2, leading to a greater magnetic force in Pair 1. Consequently, the smaller size of Magnet B in Pair 2 results in a smaller magnitude of the magnetic force compared to Pair 1."

Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	A jack-o'-lantern rotting in the sun is a chemical change. The matter in the jack-o'-lantern breaks down. It turns into a different type of matter that is soft and smells bad.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""chemical change"" because the process of a jack-o'-lantern rotting involves the decomposition of organic matter, which results in the formation of new substances. This transformation signifies a change at the molecular level, as the original matter breaks down and produces different compounds, often accompanied by the release of gases and odors. In contrast, a physical change would not alter the chemical composition of the material, which is not the case here."
	Which text uses the word nauseous in its traditional sense?	['Some people find caffeine nauseous, so they avoid coffee, soda, and energy drinks.', 'The high caffeine content in coffee, soda, and energy drinks can make some people nauseous.']	0		closed choice	grade9	language science	writing-strategies	Word usage and nuance	Explore words with new or contested usages	"Words change in meaning when speakers begin using them in new ways. For example, the word peruse once only meant to examine in detail, but it's now also commonly used to mean to look through in a casual manner.
When a word changes in meaning, its correct usage is often debated. Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.
The traditional usage above is considered more standard.
David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses nauseous in its traditional sense: causing disgust or nausea.
Some people find caffeine nauseous, so they avoid coffee, soda, and energy drinks.
The first text uses nauseous in its nontraditional sense: feeling disgusted or nauseated.
The high caffeine content in coffee, soda, and energy drinks can make some people nauseous.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word nauseous because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose option (1) because it uses ""nauseous"" to describe the high caffeine content in beverages as something that can cause nausea, which aligns with the traditional sense of the word. In contrast, option (0) incorrectly uses ""nauseous"" to describe people as feeling nauseated, which is a nontraditional and less accepted usage. The traditional definition of ""nauseous"" refers to something that induces nausea, while the nontraditional usage refers to the feeling itself. Therefore, option (1) adheres to the standard definition of the term."

A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body."	"A hummingbird is a bird. Like other birds, a hummingbird is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
A bumble bee is an insect. Like other insects, a bumble bee is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.
An American crocodile is a reptile. Like other reptiles, an American crocodile is a vertebrate. It has a backbone.
A lion is a mammal. Like other mammals, a lion is a vertebrate. It has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task requires selecting an invertebrate from the given choices. Invertebrates are animals that lack a backbone, and among the options, the bumble bee is the only invertebrate as it is an insect. The other choices—American crocodile, hummingbird, and lion—are all vertebrates, as they possess a backbone. Hence, the bumble bee is the correct answer."

"	The text argues that off-leash dogs would somehow cause an increase in crime in Booneville. However, these two ideas aren't related. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a red herring.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The argument presented in the text introduces the issue of off-leash dogs and suggests that this problem could lead to an increase in crime, which is not directly related. This shift from the original topic of dog control to a concern about crime is characteristic of a red herring fallacy, where an unrelated topic is introduced to divert attention from the original issue. Therefore, the correct choice is (1) red herring."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
water boiling on a stove
baking an apple pie"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	2		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Water boiling on the stove is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The liquid changes into a gas, but a different type of matter is not formed.
Baking an apple pie is a chemical change. The type of matter in the pie changes when it is baked. The crust turns brown, and the apples become soft.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Water boiling is a physical change. But baking a pie is not.
Both are chemical changes.
Baking a pie is a chemical change. But water boiling is not.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: Both changes involve heating, as water boiling on the stove requires heat to convert liquid water into steam, and baking an apple pie involves applying heat to cook the ingredients. While one is a physical change and the other is a chemical change, the common factor is that both processes are initiated by the application of heat. The heating element is crucial in both scenarios, making option (2) the correct choice."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The statement that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 is true because the distance between the magnets in Pair 1 is smaller compared to Pair 2. According to the principles of magnetism, the strength of the magnetic force decreases with increasing distance between magnets. Since all the magnets are made of the same material, the closer proximity of the magnets in Pair 1 results in a stronger magnetic interaction than in Pair 2, where the magnets are farther apart."

2,245 millimeters, 2,245 centimeters, and 2,245 meters are all too short."	"ANSWER: 2,245 kilometers  
SOLUTION: The Red Sea is approximately 2,245 kilometers long, making this the most accurate choice among the options provided. The other measurements in centimeters, meters, and millimeters are significantly shorter than the actual length of the Red Sea. Therefore, they do not reflect the true scale of this geographic feature. Choosing 2,245 kilometers aligns with known geographic data and provides a correct representation of the Red Sea's length."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose Solution A because it has a greater number of purple particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. To determine concentration, we compare the ratio of the number of solute particles to the volume of solvent for each solution. Since Solution A contains more purple particles and maintains a similar or smaller volume of solvent, it results in a higher concentration of purple particles compared to Solution B.

SOLUTION: On a cold, snowy day, the temperature is typically at or below freezing, which is 0°C (32°F). Given the choices of 20°C and 20°F, 20°F is a more accurate representation of a cold temperature associated with snow. In contrast, 20°C is relatively warm and would not be consistent with snowy weather conditions. Thus, selecting 20°F aligns better with the expected temperatures during cold, snowy days."

Boron trifluoride is ()."	['a compound', 'an elementary substance']	0	Boron trifluoride is used to make many types of chemicals, such as plastics. The chemical formula for boron trifluoride is BF3.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"Every substance around you is made of one or more chemical elements, or types of atoms. Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether boron trifluoride is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for boron trifluoride is BF3. This formula contains two symbols: B for boron and F for fluorine. So, the formula tells you that boron trifluoride is made of two chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, boron trifluoride is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Boron trifluoride (BF3) is made up of two different elements: boron (B) and fluorine (F). Since it consists of more than one element that are chemically bonded together, it qualifies as a compound. In contrast, an elementary substance is made up of only one type of element. Therefore, the correct classification of boron trifluoride is as a compound, leading to the choice of option (0)."

SOLUTION: I chose ""chemical change"" because photosynthesis involves the transformation of raw materials—carbon dioxide and water—into glucose and oxygen through a series of chemical reactions facilitated by sunlight. This process fundamentally alters the chemical structure of the reactants, producing new substances (sugar and oxygen). In contrast, a physical change does not result in new substances being formed, which is not the case with photosynthesis. Therefore, it is accurately classified as a chemical change."

However, it contains some truth: if a restaurant is frequently perceived to be too crowded, many people will no longer want to go there."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs a paradox because it presents a statement that seems contradictory: ""Nobody goes there anymore: it's too crowded."" At first glance, it appears illogical that a place can be both empty of patrons and overly crowded at the same time. However, this paradox reveals a deeper truth about social perceptions; if a restaurant is perceived as too crowded, potential customers might avoid it, leading to fewer diners.

The lace monitor has a narrow neck. Its neck is not adapted to help it appear larger and more dangerous to a predator."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the bearded dragon because it has spiny scales around its neck that it uses to appear larger and more intimidating to predators. This behavior is similar to that of the Mozambique spitting cobra, which spreads its hood for the same purpose. In contrast, the lace monitor has a narrow neck that is not adapted for this defensive display, making it less effective in scaring off predators.

Some words are close in meaning but have different connotations.
For example, think about the words eager and impatient. They both mean wanting something to happen, but they have different connotations.
Eager has a positive connotation. It is a nice word. An eager person is happy and excited.
Impatient has a negative connotation. It is not a nice word. An impatient person is often pushy and demanding."	A bullheaded employee has a more negative connotation. Bullheaded and persistent both denote not backing down. However, bullheaded describes a person who is overly stubborn, while persistent describes a person who is determined and tenacious.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The phrase ""a bullheaded employee"" carries a more negative connotation compared to ""a persistent employee."" While both terms imply a refusal to give up, ""bullheaded"" suggests a stubbornness that can be detrimental, indicating an unwillingness to consider other perspectives or adapt. In contrast, ""persistent"" has a more positive tone, implying determination and resilience without the negative implications of inflexibility.

['18 meters', '18 kilometers', '18 millimeters', '18 centimeters']	3	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance, mass, and volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a hammer is 18 centimeters.
18 millimeters is too short. 18 meters and 18 kilometers are too long."	"ANSWER: 18 centimeters  
SOLUTION: A hammer is typically a hand tool that is designed for manual use, and its length usually falls within the range of a few centimeters to a couple of feet. Among the choices provided, 18 centimeters is a reasonable estimate for the length of a standard hammer, as most hammers are around this size. The other options, such as 18 millimeters, are too short, while 18 meters and 18 kilometers are excessively long for a hand tool. Thus, 18 centimeters is the most appropriate choice."

Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Use the arrows to follow how matter moves through this food web. For each answer choice, try to find a path of arrows that starts from the lichen.
No arrow points to the bilberry. So, in this food web, matter does not move from the lichen to the bilberry."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: In the provided food web, the lichen is a primary producer that serves as a food source for other organisms. The collared lemming is a herbivore that feeds on the lichen, which means that it directly consumes the matter from the lichen, allowing it to contain matter that was once part of it. Since there are no arrows indicating a pathway from the lichen to the bilberry, it is clear that the bilberry does not derive matter from the lichen in this ecosystem. Thus, the collared lemming is the correct choice as it has a direct connection to the lichen through the food web."

The two mugs of cocoa have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 90°F mug of cocoa is colder than the 95°F mug of cocoa, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The task involves comparing two identical objects, both being 250-gram mugs of cocoa, but with different temperatures.

The Arctic fox has an arrow pointing to it from the bilberry, which is a producer. The Arctic fox also has an arrow pointing to it from the collared lemming, which is a consumer. The Arctic fox eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The Arctic fox is classified as an omnivore because it has arrows pointing to it from both a producer (the bilberry) and a consumer (the collared lemming). This indicates that the Arctic fox consumes both plant matter and animal matter. In contrast, the bilberry is solely a producer, as it does not have any arrows pointing towards it, which means it does not consume other organisms. Therefore, the correct choice indicating an omnivore is the Arctic fox, corresponding to choice (0)."

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.

All three bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 87°F bowl of oatmeal is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature when mass and composition are constant. In this case, all three bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their temperatures. The bowl at 87°F is the lowest in temperature, meaning it possesses the least thermal energy compared to the other two bowls at higher temperatures of 101°F and 103°F.

The temperature of each aquarium decreased, which means that the thermal energy of each aquarium decreased. So, thermal energy was transferred from each aquarium to the surroundings.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose answer (1) because the scenario describes two aquariums, one covered and one uncovered, next to an open window. Since the temperature of each aquarium decreased over time, this indicates that thermal energy was being lost.

The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
A certain tomato plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the fruit texture gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The tomato plant's genotype for the fruit texture gene is ff. The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for fuzzy fruit. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the tomato plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The tomato plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the tomato plant's phenotype for the fruit texture trait must be fuzzy fruit."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The tomato plant has a homozygous genotype of ff for the fruit texture gene, which consists entirely of the recessive allele for fuzzy fruit. Since the f allele is recessive, the presence of only f alleles means that the phenotype expressed will be fuzzy fruit. Therefore, the correct answer, representing the phenotype of the plant, is fuzzy fruit, corresponding to choice (0)."

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that the magnets in Pair 1 are of equal size, while Magnet B in Pair 2 is smaller than Magnet B in Pair 1. Since the smaller magnet in Pair 2 results in a reduced magnetic force compared to the larger magnet in Pair 1, it follows that the magnitude of the magnetic force is indeed smaller in Pair 2.

SOLUTION: Kraken has the homozygous genotype II for the tail spots gene, meaning he possesses two dominant alleles for the trait. Since the allele for a spotted tail (I) is dominant over the allele for an unspotted tail (i), having the genotype II ensures that Kraken will exhibit the dominant phenotype.

SOLUTION: The trait of skin color is determined by genetics, as individuals inherit specific genes from their parents that dictate their skin tone. Since Shelley has naturally pale skin, it suggests that this trait was passed down to her from her family lineage rather than being a result of environmental factors or personal choices. Therefore, it is classified as an inherited trait."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	0		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"Oxygen is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.
Oxygen can be stored in metal tanks. If oxygen leaks out of the tank, the oxygen will expand into the space around the tank."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Oxygen is classified as a gas at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure. Gases do not have a fixed shape or volume and will expand to fill the available space, which is characteristic behavior of oxygen. Additionally, oxygen can be stored in metal tanks as a gas, and when released, it disperses into the surrounding environment, confirming its gaseous state. Therefore, the correct choice is that oxygen is a gas."

The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. An animal's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each animal's backbone is colored orange.
Other animals do not have a backbone. In fact, these animals don't have any bones! Some animals without backbones have a hard outer cover. Other animals have a soft body."	"A human is a mammal. Like other mammals, a human has a backbone.
A fly is an insect. Like other insects, a fly does not have a backbone. It has a hard outer cover."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""1"" because a human is classified as a mammal, which is one of the categories of animals that possess a backbone. In contrast, a fly is an insect and lacks a backbone, having a hard exoskeleton instead. The hint provided emphasizes that mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians all have backbones, further supporting that the correct choice in this context is the human. Thus, the backbone is a defining characteristic of the human among the given options."

"Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The problem states that the sizes of the magnets in both Pair 1 and Pair 2 are the same, and the distance between the magnets is also the same. Since the magnetic force is influenced by both size and distance, and both factors are identical for the two pairs, it follows that the magnitude of the magnetic force must be the same in both pairs.

The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

['Shakespeare', 'Greek history']	1		closed choice	grade7	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion spartan is Greek history.
Soldiers from the city of Sparta in ancient Greece were known for their self-restraint, self-discipline, and indifference to luxury.
The allusion spartan means simple and austere."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The allusion ""spartan"" originates from Greek history, specifically referring to the ancient city-state of Sparta. Spartans were renowned for their austere lifestyle, rigorous discipline, and emphasis on simplicity, which contrasts sharply with luxury and excess. Therefore, when Jenny is described as having ""spartan ways,"" it implies that she embodies these characteristics of simplicity and self-discipline, aligning with the historical context of Sparta. This makes Greek history the correct source of the allusion."
	"Does the sentence use a simile or a metaphor?
From across the room, Uncle Logan's laughter was booming thunder."	['simile', 'metaphor']	1		closed choice	grade4	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Identify similes and metaphors	"Similes and metaphors are figures of speech that compare two things that are not actually alike.
A simile compares two things by saying that one is like the other. Similes often use the words like and as.
My sister runs like a cheetah.
The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"From across the room, Uncle Logan's laughter was booming thunder.
The words laughter and thunder are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""From across the room, Uncle Logan's laughter was booming thunder"" compares laughter to thunder without using the words ""like"" or ""as,"" which are characteristic of similes. Instead, the phrase directly equates the two, indicating that Uncle Logan's laughter is being described as if it were thunder itself. This direct comparison is the hallmark of a metaphor, making the choice of a metaphor (1) correct."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=355x307 at 0x31376D310>	"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth."	['false', 'true']	1	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 1,000 times the volume of Earth.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. The volume of Jupiter is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is more than 1.08 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is more than 1,000 times that of Earth."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The statement is true because the volume of Jupiter is approximately 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, while the volume of Earth is about 1.08 x 10^12 km^3. When you multiply Earth's volume by 1,000, you get approximately 1.08 x 10^15 km^3. Since 1.43 x 10^15 km^3 (Jupiter's volume) is greater than 1.08 x 10^15 km^3, it confirms that Jupiter's volume is indeed more than 1,000 times that of Earth. Therefore, the statement is accurate."

['repel', 'attract']	1	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnets will attract each other because they are positioned with opposite poles facing one another. The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other, and according to the fundamental principle of magnetism, opposite poles attract. Therefore, since the conditions are met for attraction, the correct answer is that the magnets will attract each other."

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The fern fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the feather fossil. So, the fern fossil is most likely younger than the feather fossil."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: In the context of sedimentary rock layers, the principle of superposition states that in an undisturbed sequence, the layers at the top are younger than those below them. Since the fern fossil is found in a shallower layer compared to the feather fossil, it indicates that the fern fossil was deposited after the feather fossil. Therefore, the fern is determined to be younger than the feather, leading to the conclusion that the correct answer is (0) fern."

Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Latrell, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Latrell down with a force of 400 N.
The diving board is pushing Latrell up with a force of 400 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have the same magnitude: 400 N. This means that the forces are balanced, so there is no net force on Latrell."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The forces acting on Latrell are balanced because the downward gravitational force of 400 N exerted by Earth is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the upward force of 400 N exerted by the diving board. Since these forces cancel each other out, there is no net force acting on Latrell. This results in a state of equilibrium, confirming that the correct description of the forces on Latrell is that they are balanced."

Hint: Magnets that attract pull together. Magnets that repel push apart."	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The two magnets will attract each other because they are positioned with opposite poles facing each other; specifically, the south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other. According to the fundamental principles of magnetism, opposite poles attract while like poles repel. Since the magnets have different poles in proximity, they will pull towards each other, resulting in attraction."
	How long does it take to fry an egg in a pan?	['4 seconds', '4 minutes']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to fry an egg in a pan is 4 minutes.
4 seconds is too fast."	"ANSWER: 4 minutes  
SOLUTION: Frying an egg typically takes a few minutes, depending on the desired level of doneness. Four seconds is far too short a time for the egg to cook properly, as the heat needs time to cook the egg white and yolk thoroughly. Therefore, 4 minutes is a more realistic estimate for the frying time, allowing for proper cooking while ensuring the egg is safe to eat."

The racket pushes the ball over the net.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Identify pushes and pulls	"One object can make another object move with a push or a pull.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	A racket hitting a tennis ball is a type of push. The tennis player hits the ball away from his racket. So, the ball flies over the net. The direction of the push is away from the tennis racket.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task asks for the direction of the push exerted by the tennis racket when hitting the ball. When a tennis player strikes the ball with the racket, the force applied pushes the ball in the direction away from the racket, propelling it over the net. Thus, the appropriate choice reflecting this action is ""away from the tennis racket."""

The Japan Trench is a deep-sea trench east of the islands of Japan. The trench formed as the Pacific Plate subducted, or sank, below the Okhotsk Plate. The two plates continue to move toward each other. This movement can cause devastating earthquakes in Japan, such as a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Plate tectonics	Describe tectonic plate boundaries around the world	"The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:
At a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.
At a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.
At a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.
One type of convergent boundary is an ocean-ocean subduction zone, which forms when two plates with oceanic crust move toward each other. One of the plates subducts, or sinks, below the other.
When one of the plates subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes in the ocean called a volcanic island arc."	"To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Japan Trench, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.
The Japan Trench is a deep-sea trench east of the islands of Japan. The trench formed as the Pacific Plate subducted, or sank, below the Okhotsk Plate. The two plates continue to move toward each other. This movement can cause devastating earthquakes in Japan, such as a magnitude 9.0 earthquake that occurred on March 11, 2011.
The underlined part of the passage explains that the Japan Trench formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Japan Trench formed at a convergent boundary."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage clearly states that the Japan Trench formed as the Pacific Plate subducted below the Okhotsk Plate, indicating that the two plates are moving toward each other. This interaction is characteristic of a convergent boundary, where one tectonic plate moves under another, leading to the formation of features like deep-sea trenches. Therefore, the correct choice is (1) convergent."

['spore cases on a heart-shaped plant', 'spore cases on a mature fern']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	"Mature ferns have spore cases on the underside of their fronds. Spores are released from the spore cases.
Heart-shaped plants produce eggs and sperm, not spores."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The spores are released from the spore cases located on the underside of the fronds of mature ferns. This distinguishes them from heart-shaped plants, which do not produce spores but instead produce gametes (eggs and sperm). Since the question specifically asks about where spores are released from, the correct choice is option (1) regarding mature ferns. Option (0) refers to a plant that is not involved in spore production."

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the Damara mole rat.

The nutria has large front teeth. Its mouth is adapted for gnawing.
The aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth and a few, small teeth. Its mouth is not adapted for gnawing. The aardvark uses its mouth to get insects out of holes and burrows."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the nutria because it has large front teeth that are specifically adapted for gnawing, similar to the Damara mole rat's adaptation. This allows the nutria to bite off small pieces of food effectively. In contrast, the aardvark has a long tube-shaped mouth with only a few small teeth, which makes it unsuitable for gnawing. The aardvark primarily uses its mouth for extracting insects, not for chewing or gnawing food."

SOLUTION: The sentence ""A beautiful desert in the middle of the country"" is a fragment because it lacks a main verb and does not express a complete thought. It describes a noun (the desert) but does not provide any action or additional information that would complete the sentence. In contrast, the first choice, ""Over the summer, my cousin Brooke visited many times,"" is a complete sentence with a subject and a verb, making it a grammatically correct statement.

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force between magnets decreases with increasing distance. In this scenario, Pair 2 has magnets that are farther apart compared to those in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnetic force in Pair 2 is weaker than that in Pair 1, making option (2) the correct choice. Since all magnets are made of the same material and the distance is the only variable affecting the force, this conclusion follows directly from the principle of magnetic force interactions."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

Both poles of each magnet line up with both poles of the other magnet. The south pole of each magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are positioned with like poles facing each other. In this case, both south poles are aligned, which results in a repulsive force between them. According to the basic principles of magnetism, like poles (south-south or north-north) repel one another, while opposite poles (north-south) attract. Thus, the configuration described leads to the conclusion that the magnets will repel."

The boxes are the same shape and size. Each mover lifts one box up into the truck at a time.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the box that is heavier.
A box holding 42 pounds is heavier than a box holding 39 pounds. So, the box holding 42 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other box."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The box holding 42 pounds is heavier than the box holding 39 pounds. According to Newton's second law, force is directly proportional to mass when acceleration is constant. Since both movers are lifting their respective boxes at the same speed (implying the same acceleration), the heavier box requires a larger force to counteract its weight. Therefore, the box holding 42 pounds is lifted with a larger force compared to the box holding 39 pounds."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The problem states that both samples of gas have the same number of particles and that each particle has the same mass and average speed. Since the average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to the temperature, having the same average speed and mass means both samples have the same average kinetic energy. Therefore, the conclusion drawn is that both samples are at the same temperature, leading to the answer of ""neither; the samples have the same temperature."""

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

Thread is a solid that can be bent or tangled. But it still has a size and shape of its own."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: Thread is the only option that is classified as a solid. Solids have a definite shape and volume, which means they do not change shape based on their container. In contrast, air inside a beach ball is a gas that expands to fill its container, and both chocolate syrup and apple juice are liquids that take the shape of their containers.

Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Salem's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa. Salem's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for not having agouti fur. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Salem's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for not having agouti fur (a) is recessive to the allele for having agouti fur (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Salem's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Salem's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be not having agouti fur."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Salem has the homozygous genotype aa for the agouti fur gene, which consists only of recessive alleles. The recessive allele (a) corresponds to not having agouti fur, while the dominant allele (A) would indicate the presence of agouti fur. Since Salem possesses only the recessive alleles, their phenotype must reflect the recessive trait, leading to the conclusion that Salem does not have agouti fur. Thus, the correct answer is 0, indicating not having agouti fur."

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The crocodile egg fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the feather fossil. So, the crocodile egg fossil is most likely younger than the feather fossil."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: In sedimentary rock sequences, the principle of superposition states that in undisturbed layers, older layers are found below younger layers. Since the crocodile egg fossil is located in a shallower layer than the feather fossil, it indicates that the crocodile egg is more recent in geological time. Thus, the crocodile egg fossil is more likely to be younger than the feather fossil."

To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside."	Grandma Bella and Grandpa Fred kiss the children before bed is a complete sentence. The subject is Grandma Bella and Grandpa Fred, and the verb is kiss.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A complete sentence must contain at least a subject and a verb, and it should express a complete thought. The choice ""Grandma Bella and Grandpa Fred kiss the children before bed"" has a clear subject (Grandma Bella and Grandpa Fred) and a verb (kiss), forming a complete thought. In contrast, ""The large mammals of the grasslands of Africa"" lacks a verb and does not express a complete idea, making it an incomplete sentence. Therefore, the correct choice is (1)."

As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Austin's snoring."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The phrase ""as quiet as a jackhammer"" is an example of verbal irony because it contrasts the literal meaning of being quiet with the actual loudness associated with a jackhammer. This suggests that Mr. Austin's snoring is, in fact, very loud, as jackhammers are notoriously noisy. The use of irony here amplifies the humor and exaggeration in the kids' description of their father's snoring, reinforcing the idea that it disrupts their peace. Thus, the correct interpretation of the verbal irony leads to the conclusion that Mr. Austin's snoring is loud."

Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above."	H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. O is the symbol for oxygen. According to the legend, oxygen atoms are shown in red. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. The chemical formula will contain the symbols H and O. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There are two oxygen atoms, so O will have a subscript of 2. The correct formula is H2 O2. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The question asks for the chemical formula of a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms. The notation for hydrogen is H and for oxygen is O. Since there are two of each atom, the chemical formula is written as H2O2. Among the provided choices, option (2) H2O2 correctly represents this composition, making it the appropriate answer."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a water balloon is 515 milliliters.
515 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: 515 

SOLUTION: The volume of a typical water balloon is much smaller than one that could hold 515 liters, which is equivalent to a large container or even a small bathtub. Water balloons are generally designed to hold around 500 milliliters to 1 liter of water. Therefore, 515 milliliters is a more reasonable estimate for the volume of a water balloon, as it aligns with common sizes found in retail settings.

['the pistil', 'the anthers']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Angiosperm and conifer life cycles	"Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again."	"Anthers make pollen. When a pollinator brushes against the anthers, pollen might stick to the pollinator.
A pollinator may drop pollen on the pistil. This is called pollination. But a pollinator does not pick up pollen from the pistil."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Pollinators pick up pollen from the anthers, which are the male reproductive parts of a flower that produce pollen. When a pollinator brushes against the anthers, pollen can adhere to their bodies. In contrast, the pistil is the female reproductive part of the flower where pollination occurs, but it does not produce pollen. Therefore, the correct choice is that pollinators pick up pollen from the anthers."

['a liquid', 'a solid']	0		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid or liquid	"Solid and liquid are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid."	"The water in a bathtub is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you move the water from a bathtub into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""0"" because water is classified as a liquid, which is defined by its ability to flow and take the shape of its container. In a bathtub, the water conforms to the shape of the tub, demonstrating the properties of a liquid. Additionally, water maintains a consistent volume regardless of the shape of the container, which is another characteristic of liquids. Thus, the correct choice is that the water in a bathtub is a liquid."

It has not rained in over a week at Marie's house.
This passage tells you about the precipitation last week at Marie's house. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage focuses on a specific recent event, stating that it has not rained in over a week at Marie's house. This indicates a short-term atmospheric condition, which is characteristic of weather rather than climate. Climate refers to the long-term patterns and averages of weather in a particular area over extended periods. Therefore, the passage clearly describes the weather."

The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.

Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"My dog, Scooter, is the security guard for our front yard mailbox.
The words Scooter and security guard are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence compares the dog, Scooter, to a security guard, asserting that he serves a similar role in protecting the mailbox. This comparison is made directly without using ""like"" or ""as,"" which would indicate a simile. Instead, by stating that Scooter ""is"" the security guard, it establishes a metaphor, which is a more direct form of comparison. Therefore, the correct answer is that the sentence uses a metaphor."

Temperate deciduous forests have the following features: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. So, the following statements describe the Białowieża Forest ecosystem: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. It has only a few types of trees. It has warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters. The following statement does not describe the Białowieża Forest: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. It has a small amount of rain or snow.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The Białowieża Forest is a temperate deciduous forest, which typically features a variety of tree species. While it does have rich soil and experiences warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, the statement ""It has only a few types of trees"" is misleading. In fact, temperate deciduous forests, including Białowieża, are characterized by a diversity of tree species rather than a limited variety.

	Select the part whose main job is to store nutrients, water, and waste in a plant cell.	['Golgi', 'chromosomes', 'nucleus', 'vacuole']	3		closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Cells	Identify functions of plant cell parts	"Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts."	The vacuole stores water, waste, and nutrients such as sugar. Plant cells usually have one vacuole.	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: The vacuole is the primary organelle in plant cells responsible for storing nutrients, water, and waste products. It is typically large and can occupy a significant portion of the cell's volume, allowing it to maintain turgor pressure, which is essential for plant structure and stability. In contrast, the other options listed—Golgi, chromosomes, and nucleus—serve different functions, such as processing proteins, carrying genetic information, and controlling cellular activities, respectively. Therefore, the vacuole is the correct choice for the task of storage in a plant cell."

Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Dad will roast a chicken for dinner"" uses the future tense, indicated by the presence of the auxiliary verb ""will"" before the main verb ""roast."" This construction signifies that the action is intended to occur at a later time. The use of ""will"" clearly indicates that the roasting of the chicken is a planned action, differentiating it from present or past tense forms. Therefore, the correct choice is future tense."

	How long does it take to peel a banana?	['13 seconds', '13 hours']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to peel a banana is 13 seconds.
13 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 13 seconds  
SOLUTION: Peeling a banana typically takes a very short amount of time, usually just a few seconds. The choice of 13 seconds is a reasonable estimate, as it reflects the quick and simple action required to peel the fruit. In contrast, 13 hours is an absurdly long duration for such a task, making it an unreasonable choice. Therefore, 13 seconds is clearly the better estimate for how long it takes to peel a banana."

In this group, the gene for the thorns trait has two alleles. The allele for having thorns (R) is dominant over the allele for not having thorns (r).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have thorns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. The question tells you that the R allele, which is for having thorns, is dominant over the r allele, which is for not having thorns.
Having thorns is the dominant allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the thorns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the thorns gene. So, offspring that have thorns must have the genotype RR or Rr.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype RR or Rr.
Not having thorns is the recessive allele's version of the thorns trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the thorns trait must have only recessive alleles for the thorns gene. So, offspring that do not have thorns must have the genotype rr.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype rr.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have thorns to offspring that do not have thorns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have thorns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have thorns."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring that have thorns (dominant phenotype) to those that do not have thorns (recessive phenotype) is 0:4, indicating that no offspring will have thorns. This is derived from the Punnett square analysis, which shows that all offspring will have the genotype rr, corresponding to the phenotype of not having thorns. Therefore, the most likely ratio is 0 for offspring with thorns to 4 for those without, leading to the conclusion that the expected ratio is 0:4."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

"	The text argues that a single polite British person indicates that all British people are nice. However, this isn't necessarily true. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a hasty generalization.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The statement makes a broad claim about all British people based on a single observation of one person's behavior. This is a classic example of a hasty generalization, where a conclusion is drawn from insufficient evidence. In this case, just because one British man was helpful, it does not justify the assertion that all British individuals possess the same quality of being nice.

"	The text argues that you don't want your grandmother to have a dog, because you want her to be lonely. However, the fact that you don't want her to have a dog doesn't necessarily suggest that you want her to be lonely. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text presents a scenario where the argument against getting the grandmother a dog is misrepresented as a desire for her to be sad and lonely. This misrepresentation simplifies the opponent's position, making it easier to attack. By framing the argument in this way, it distorts the original position, which aligns with the definition of a straw man fallacy. The red herring option does not apply here, as the argument does not divert to an unrelated topic but rather distorts the original argument itself."

However, even though Jake's friend was irresponsible, that doesn't necessarily mean that Jake is also irresponsible. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs the logical fallacy known as guilt by association, where the speaker attempts to discredit Jake Perry by linking him to the actions of his friend. By highlighting that Jake's friend was irresponsible with a dog, the argument implies that Jake must also be irresponsible without providing direct evidence of Jake's own behavior.

The volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune."	['true', 'false']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Neptune.
Then compare the result to the volume of Uranus. The volume of Uranus is 6.83 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 6.25 x 10^14 km^3. So, the volume of Uranus is less than ten times the volume of Neptune."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The statement is true because the volume of Uranus, which is approximately 6.83 x 10^13 km^3, is indeed less than ten times the volume of Neptune, calculated to be 6.25 x 10^14 km^3 (10 times Neptune's volume, approximately 6.25 x 10^13 km^3). Comparing these two values shows that Uranus's volume is significantly smaller than this threshold. Therefore, the assertion in the statement is accurate, confirming that Uranus's volume is less than ten times that of Neptune."

""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion snake oil salesman is U.S. history.
Thousands of Chinese laborers immigrated to the United States in the 1800 s. Many of them brought traditional medicines, including snake oil made from the Chinese water snake. In time, some people made fake versions of the remedy, and when the fakes were eventually exposed as ineffective, the salesmen gained a poor reputation.
The allusion snake oil salesman means a person making false promises."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""snake oil salesman"" originates from U.S. history, specifically related to the 19th-century practice of selling fraudulent medicines. The term refers to individuals who sold ineffective remedies, often claiming they had miraculous healing properties. This historical context is essential for understanding the negative connotation associated with the term, as it signifies someone who makes false promises or engages in deceptive practices.

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space.
A pair of scissors is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you use a pair of scissors to cut paper, the pair of scissors still has a size and shape of its own.
The water in a glass is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour water from a glass into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space.
Grape juice is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour grape juice into a different container, the grape juice will take the shape of that container. But the grape juice will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A pair of scissors is a solid object, as it has a definite size and shape that does not change regardless of the environment. In contrast, water and grape juice are both liquids, which take the shape of their containers, and air from a hair dryer is a gas, which expands to fill any available space.

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnetic force between magnets decreases with increasing distance. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than those in Pair 2, the force between the magnets in Pair 1 is weaker.

On a snowy day, Candice rode her sled down a big hill."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Kinetic and potential energy	Identify changes in gravitational potential energy	"Gravitational potential energy is stored between any two objects. So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the sled and the center of Earth changed.
The bottom of the hill was lower than the point where Candice started sledding. As Candice rode toward the bottom of the hill, the distance between the sled and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the sled and Earth decreased as Candice rode down the hill."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The gravitational potential energy of an object depends on its height above a reference point, which in this case is the center of the Earth. As Candice sleds down the hill, her height decreases, leading to a reduction in gravitational potential energy. Since the mass of the sled remains constant, the energy change is solely due to the change in height. Therefore, as she descends, the gravitational potential energy decreases."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

Fallacy | Description
false causation | the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other
false dichotomy | an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist
hasty generalization | a broad claim based on too few observations
slippery slope fallacy | the false assumption that a small first step will necessarily lead to extreme consequences

"	The text argues that Ms. Stafford thinks algebra is useless because she would let students take statistics instead. However, Ms. Stafford only claimed that students should be allowed to take statistics instead of algebra. She did not suggest that algebra is a useless subject. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text demonstrates a straw man fallacy because it misrepresents Ms. Stafford's position on the value of algebra. Instead of accurately addressing her suggestion that students should have the option to take statistics, the response distorts her argument by implying that she believes algebra is entirely useless. This makes it easier to argue against her position, as it creates a false narrative that simplifies the complexity of her original suggestion."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=355x307 at 0x312A4F9E0>	"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than ten times as large as Saturn's volume."	['false', 'true']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Saturn.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. The volume of Jupiter is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 8.27 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than ten times as large as Saturn's volume."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The statement is false because Jupiter's volume, which is approximately 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, is actually less than ten times the volume of Saturn. Saturn's volume is about 8.27 x 10^14 km^3, and when multiplied by ten, it results in 8.27 x 10^15 km^3. Since Jupiter's volume is not greater than this calculated value, the assertion that Jupiter's volume is more than ten times that of Saturn's is incorrect."

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.

SOLUTION: The first letter opening, ""Dear Mr. Strickland,"" is more formal because it employs a title and last name, which is a standard convention in formal correspondence. This approach conveys respect and professionalism, making it appropriate for business or official communications. In contrast, ""Dear Eddie,"" uses a first name, indicating a more casual or familiar relationship, which is less formal in nature. Therefore, the choice of title and last name in the first option clearly makes it the more formal opening."

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"Magma is a liquid. A liquid can change shape. But it still takes up the same amount of space.
Magma is melted rock. Rock is usually a solid. But when it gets hot enough, it can melt! Unlike solid rock, magma can change shape easily and flow."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose option (2) because magma is defined as molten rock that has melted due to high temperatures beneath the Earth's surface. Unlike solids, which maintain a fixed shape, magma can flow and change shape, which is characteristic of liquids. The explanation provided confirms that magma is indeed in a liquid state, as it retains its volume while being able to change its form easily when heated."

The military macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is not adapted to catch insects. The military macaw uses its beak to crack open large, hard nuts."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the black-capped chickadee as the answer because it has a short, thin beak that is adapted for catching insects, similar to the common nighthawk. The text explicitly states that the black-capped chickadee's beak is suitable for this purpose, while the military macaw's thick hooked beak is designed for cracking open hard nuts, making it unsuitable for catching insects.

The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.

Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"My dog, Rusty, is the security guard for our front yard mailbox.
The words Rusty and security guard are compared without the word like or as. So, the sentence uses a metaphor."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence compares Rusty, the dog, to a ""security guard"" without using ""like"" or ""as,"" which is the hallmark of a metaphor. In this case, Rusty is being directly equated to a security guard, implying that he protects the mailbox just as a guard would protect a property.

The other gray whale moved 20 miles in 10 hours.
Notice that each gray whale spent the same amount of time moving. The gray whale that moved 50 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that gray whale must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The first gray whale moved 50 miles in 10 hours, which gives it a speed of 5 miles per hour (50 miles / 10 hours). The second gray whale moved 20 miles in the same 10 hours, resulting in a speed of 2 miles per hour (20 miles / 10 hours). Since 5 miles per hour is greater than 2 miles per hour, the gray whale that traveled 50 miles is clearly moving at a higher speed. Therefore, the correct choice is option (0)."

It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.

A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.

A sunflower seed is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, a sunflower seed is not a mineral."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A sunflower seed is not a mineral because it is a product of a living organism and contains various components, making it a mixture rather than a pure substance. In contrast, both native gold and muscovite are pure substances that form naturally and are not derived from living organisms. Minerals are defined as naturally occurring, inorganic solids with a crystalline structure, whereas a sunflower seed does not meet these criteria.

Since Pair 1 has a greater distance between its magnets compared to Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 will be smaller than in Pair 2. Therefore, the correct statement is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1."

The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

32 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 32 minutes  
SOLUTION: The choice of 32 minutes as the better estimate for mowing the lawn is based on common practices and time expectations. Mowing a typical residential lawn generally takes anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours, depending on the size and type of mower used. The option of 32 hours is excessively long and unrealistic for this task, making 32 minutes a more reasonable and practical estimate for completing the job efficiently."

The allele for a gray body (B) is dominant over the allele for a black body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a black body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a gray body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a black body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A black body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a black body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a black body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a gray body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a black body."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to those with a black body is 4:0, indicating that all offspring will have gray bodies. This is because the gray body allele (B) is dominant over the black body allele (b), and since both parents are likely homozygous dominant or heterozygous for the gray body trait, all potential offspring will carry at least one B allele. Consequently, there will be no offspring with the recessive black body phenotype (bb), leading to the conclusion that the expected ratio is 4 gray to 0 black."

Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that potassium chloride is composed of two chemical elements: chlorine and potassium. Since potassium chloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, potassium chloride is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Potassium chloride is represented as a combination of potassium and chlorine atoms, which are two distinct chemical elements. Since it is made up of more than one element bonded together, it classifies as a compound rather than an elementary substance. An elementary substance consists of only one type of atom, while potassium chloride clearly demonstrates the characteristics of a compound. Therefore, the correct choice is (0), indicating that potassium chloride is a compound."

The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Benedict Arnold is U.S. history.
Benedict Arnold was an American officer who secretly aided the British during the American Revolution.
The allusion Benedict Arnold means a traitor."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""Benedict Arnold"" originates from U.S. history, specifically referring to the American Revolutionary War. Arnold was a general who defected to the British side, making him synonymous with betrayal and treachery in American culture.

Organisms get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how organisms in an ecosystem get their food.
The food chain begins with the producer. A producer can change matter that is not food into food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. Carbon dioxide and water are not food, but sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other organisms. There can be several kinds of consumers in a food chain:
A primary consumer eats producers. The word primary tells you that this is the first consumer in a food chain.
A secondary consumer eats primary consumers. The word secondary tells you that this is the second consumer in a food chain.
A tertiary consumer eats secondary consumers. The word tertiary tells you that this is the third consumer in a food chain.
A top consumer is the animal at the top of a food chain. Food chains can have different numbers of organisms. For example, when there are four organisms in the chain, the top consumer is the tertiary consumer. But if there are five organisms in the chain, the top consumer eats the tertiary consumer!"	In this food chain, the deer mouse is a secondary consumer because it eats a primary consumer. The primary consumer in this food chain is the katydid.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The deer mouse is classified as a secondary consumer because it feeds on primary consumers, such as the katydid, which in turn consumes producers like grass or plants. In ecological terms, primary consumers are typically herbivores that eat producers, while secondary consumers are carnivores or omnivores that eat those herbivores. Since the deer mouse's diet includes the katydid, it fulfills the role of a secondary consumer in the food chain presented."

['4:0', '0:4', '2:2', '3:1', '1:3']	2	"This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for climbing growth (G) is dominant over the allele for bush growth (g).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the G allele, which is for climbing growth, is dominant over the g allele, which is for bush growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth."	"ANSWER: 2:2  
SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to bush growth is derived from the genotypes present in the Punnett square. Since climbing growth (G) is dominant over bush growth (g), the genotypes GG and Gg both express climbing growth, while only gg expresses bush growth. The Punnett square reveals that there are 2 boxes representing climbing growth (GG and Gg) and 2 boxes representing bush growth (gg), resulting in a ratio of 2:2, which simplifies to 1:1. However, since the answer options provided are in whole numbers, the correct choice is 2:2."

Andrew will give up the chance to eat the peach cobbler. Andrew thinks peach cobbler would have tasted better than sunflower seeds will."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The cost in this scenario refers to what Andrew has to give up in order to make his choice. By deciding to eat sunflower seeds, he is giving up the opportunity to enjoy the peach cobbler, which he believes would taste better. This reflects the concept of opportunity cost, where the value of the next best alternative (the peach cobbler) is what Andrew sacrifices by choosing the healthier option. Therefore, option (1) accurately represents the cost associated with his decision."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: I chose sample A because the particles in this sample have a higher average kinetic energy than those in sample B, which directly correlates with temperature. The higher mass and greater average speed of the particles in sample A contribute to their increased kinetic energy. Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a substance, sample A must have the higher temperature compared to sample B."

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian.

The other blue jay moved 190 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each blue jay spent the same amount of time moving. The blue jay that moved 180 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that blue jay must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The blue jay that moved 180 kilometers in 5 hours was moving at a lower speed compared to the blue jay that moved 190 kilometers in the same amount of time. Since both blue jays took the same time to travel their respective distances, the one that covered less distance (180 kilometers) must have had a slower speed. Speed is calculated as distance divided by time, and in this case, the blue jay traveling 180 kilometers has a lower speed than the one traveling 190 kilometers."

Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.

SOLUTION: I chose argon (Ar) as the elementary substance because it is represented by a single chemical symbol, indicating that it consists of only one type of atom. In contrast, both cyclopropane (C3H6) and phosphine (PH3) contain multiple symbols, which means they are composed of different elements and are therefore classified as compounds. Since elementary substances are defined as substances made up of only one type of element, argon fits this definition perfectly."
	Which metal paper clip has a lower temperature?	['the metal paper clip with less thermal energy', 'the metal paper clip with more thermal energy']	0	Two metal paper clips are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two metal paper clips are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the metal paper clip with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question compares two identical metal paper clips that differ only in their thermal energies. According to the principles of thermodynamics, the temperature of an object is directly related to its thermal energy; therefore, the paper clip with less thermal energy must have a lower temperature. Since one clip has more thermal energy and the other has less, it logically follows that the one with less thermal energy is at a lower temperature. Thus, the answer is the metal paper clip with less thermal energy."

Its scientific name is Larus occidentalis.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Classification and scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A western gull's scientific name is Larus occidentalis. The first word of its scientific name is Larus.
Strix aluco is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix aluco and Larus occidentalis are not in the same genus.
Polysticta stelleri is in the genus Polysticta. The first word of its scientific name is Polysticta. So, Polysticta stelleri and Larus occidentalis are not in the same genus.
Larus michahellis is in the genus Larus. The first word of its scientific name is Larus. So, Larus michahellis and Larus occidentalis are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The organism that shares the same genus as the western gull (Larus occidentalis) is Larus michahellis. Both species belong to the genus Larus, which is confirmed by their scientific names, as the first word for both is ""Larus."" In contrast, Strix aluco belongs to the genus Strix, and Polysticta stelleri belongs to the genus Polysticta, meaning neither of these two options shares the same genus with the western gull. Therefore, the correct choice is Larus michahellis."

One friend sits in the wagon at a time.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the friend who is heavier.
A friend who weighs 32 pounds is heavier than a friend who weighs 31 pounds. So, to move the wagon at the same speed each time, Ruben needs to use a larger force to start moving the wagon with a friend who weighs 32 pounds."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose the friend who weighs 32 pounds because a heavier load requires a greater force to move it at the same speed. According to Newton's second law of motion, force equals mass times acceleration (F=ma). Thus, to maintain consistent movement across the yard, Ruben needs to exert a larger force when pulling the friend who weighs 32 pounds compared to the one who weighs 31 pounds."

['a solid', 'a gas', 'a liquid']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"Diesel is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour diesel into a different container, the diesel will take the shape of that container."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Diesel is classified as a liquid because it flows and takes the shape of its container, which is a characteristic of liquids. Unlike solids, which maintain a fixed shape, and gases, which expand to fill their container, diesel exhibits properties typical of liquids, such as viscosity and the ability to be poured. Additionally, diesel fuels are used in engines and various applications in a liquid form, further confirming its classification as a liquid."

SOLUTION: The analysis of the objects reveals that while jello, marbles, and ocean water are not sour or flexible, they all share the characteristic of being translucent. Translucent objects allow light to pass through, albeit not clearly, which applies to all four items in question. The assessment of the properties confirms that the only commonality among the four objects is their translucence, leading to the conclusion that option (2) is the best choice."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Breaking a stick in half is a physical change. The stick gets broken into two pieces. But the pieces are still made of the same type of matter as the original stick.
Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: Both breaking a stick in half and mixing sand and gravel are physical changes. In each case, no new substances are formed; the original materials retain their chemical properties. The stick is simply divided into pieces, and the sand and gravel maintain their identities when combined. Therefore, the most accurate choice is that both are only physical changes."

The property that all three objects have in common is bumpy."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""bumpy"" because all three objects were evaluated for the properties of being stretchy, soft, and bumpy. It was determined that none of the objects were soft or stretchy, but they all exhibited the characteristic of being bumpy, as they were covered in lumps and uneven surfaces. Therefore, ""bumpy"" is the only property shared among the three objects."

Albatrosses live near the ocean. They hunt squid, fish, and other small animals."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: A leafy seadragon is the only option listed that qualifies as a fish, as it lives underwater and has fins instead of limbs. The other choices—box turtle, Canadian lynx, and albatross—are not fish; they belong to different animal classes (reptiles, mammals, and birds, respectively).

A piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.
If you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.

SOLUTION: Both changes, a penny tarnishing and a piece of apple turning brown, are chemical changes. In both cases, the original substances undergo a transformation due to a reaction with oxygen; the penny reacts with elements in the air, while the apple reacts with oxygen, leading to the formation of different substances. These changes are not reversible through simple physical means, as they result in alterations to the chemical structure of the materials involved.

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.

Others are born with naturally curly hair.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	"Human hair can be naturally straight or naturally curly. Straight and curly are examples of hair texture.
Some people use tools to change how their hair looks. But this doesn't affect the natural texture of their hair. So, having naturally straight hair is an inherited trait."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The trait of having naturally straight hair is considered inherited because it is determined by genetics, which is passed down from parents to their offspring. In the context provided, it is mentioned that some individuals are born with naturally straight hair, indicating that this characteristic is not influenced by environmental factors or personal choices. Acquired traits, on the other hand, are learned or developed over time and do not have a genetic basis. Therefore, since Russell's straight hair is a natural characteristic, it is classified as inherited."
	Based on this information, what is Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?	['white spots', 'solid coloring']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Ace is a cow from this group. Ace has the heterozygous genotype Aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Ace's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Ace's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Ace has a heterozygous genotype of Aa for the coat pattern gene, where A is the dominant allele for solid coloring and a is the recessive allele for white spots. Since the presence of at least one dominant allele (A) determines the phenotype, Ace will exhibit the trait associated with the dominant allele, which is solid coloring. Thus, Ace's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is solid coloring."

Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The scar on Nina's right leg is an acquired trait because it results from an injury or accident that occurred during her life, rather than being passed down genetically from her parents. Scars are formed as a response to the healing process after skin damage, which is influenced by environmental factors. Since children do not inherit scars from their parents, the presence of a scar indicates it was acquired through life experiences rather than inherited through genetics."

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait. First, consider the alleles in Chuck's genotype for the coat pattern gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant over the allele for white spots (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Chuck's genotype of Aa has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Chuck's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be solid coloring."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Chuck's heterozygous genotype (Aa) includes one dominant allele (A) for solid coloring and one recessive allele (a) for white spots. According to the principles of dominance in genetics, the presence of the dominant allele (A) will determine the phenotype. Since Chuck has at least one dominant allele, his phenotype for the coat pattern trait is solid coloring, which corresponds to choice (1)."

So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether Gilligan's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for black eyes (e) is recessive to the allele for red eyes (E). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Gilligan's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Gilligan's phenotype for the eye color trait must be black eyes."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Gilligan's genotype is homozygous recessive (ee) for the eye color trait, which consists of two recessive alleles. Since the allele for black eyes (e) is recessive, and there are no dominant alleles present (E), Gilligan will express the recessive phenotype. Therefore, Gilligan's phenotype for eye color is black eyes, which corresponds to the choice represented by the number 1."

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each bicycle moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each bicycle moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each bicycle moved for 5 hours. The bicycle that moved 135 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that bicycle must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: To determine which bicycle was moving at the highest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each bicycle by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Each bicycle traveled for 5 hours. The speeds are as follows: the first bicycle traveled 110 kilometers, giving a speed of 22 km/h; the second traveled 85 kilometers, resulting in a speed of 17 km/h; and the third bicycle traveled 135 kilometers, which gives a speed of 27 km/h.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are oriented such that the south pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other. According to the fundamental principle of magnetism, like poles repel each other while opposite poles attract. Since both magnets are showing the same pole towards each other, they will push away from one another, resulting in a repelling effect."

SOLUTION: Ian's scar is an acquired trait because it resulted from an accident or injury during his life. Scars are not passed down from parents to children; rather, they are formed due to external factors that cause damage to the skin. This aligns with the hint provided, which emphasizes that scars are typically acquired through environmental interactions rather than being inherited genetically.

['the male part', 'the female part']	0	This diagram shows the life cycle of an apple tree.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Angiosperm and conifer life cycles	"Flowering plants, called angiosperms, use their flowers for sexual reproduction.
Flowers can have male parts, female parts, or both! The male part is called the stamen, and the female part is called the pistil.
Both the male and female parts are needed for sexual reproduction. The female part produces eggs, and the male part produces pollen. Pollen contains cells that become sperm.
Pollination happens when pollen lands on top of the pistil. Self-pollination happens when a plant with both male and female parts pollinates itself. Cross-pollination happens when pollen from one plant lands on the pistil of a flower on a different plant. Animals, including birds and insects, can be pollinators. Many pollinators come to flowers to get food. As a pollinator feeds, it moves pollen from one flower to another.
After pollination, sperm from the pollen fuse with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs then grow into seeds. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate and grow into a new plant.
The new plant can grow flowers and begin the angiosperm plant life cycle again."	"The male part of the flower makes pollen. The anthers, which are part of the stamen, produce pollen.
The female part of the flower makes eggs, not pollen."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The male part of a flower, known as the stamen, is responsible for producing pollen. Specifically, the anthers, which are part of the stamen, release pollen grains that are essential for the fertilization process. In contrast, the female part of the flower, called the pistil, is involved in producing ovules or eggs, not pollen. Therefore, the correct choice is (0), the male part."

Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to drain all of the water in a full bathtub is 50 seconds.
50 hours is too slow."	"ANSWER: 50 seconds  
SOLUTION: I chose 50 seconds as the better estimate for how long it takes to drain all of the water from a full bathtub because typical household bathtubs are designed to drain water relatively quickly. A standard bathtub drain can usually discharge water in a matter of seconds to minutes, depending on the diameter of the drain and water flow rate. In contrast, 50 hours is excessively long and impractical for draining a bathtub, making 50 seconds the more reasonable choice."

So, Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Boxer's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Boxer's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Boxer's genotype is LL, which consists of two dominant alleles for the coat color trait. The dominant allele (L) corresponds to a black coat color, while the recessive allele (l) corresponds to a red coat. Since Boxer has no recessive alleles in his genotype, he will express the phenotype associated with the dominant allele, which is a black coat. Thus, the correct answer is that Boxer's phenotype for the coat color trait is a black coat."

A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Melting wax is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The wax changes from solid to liquid. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Wax melting is caused by heating. But dust settling out of the air is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: The two changes, dust settling out of the air and melting wax, are both classified as physical changes, as they do not result in the formation of new substances. Dust settling is a result of gravity acting on particles in the air, while melting wax involves a change of state from solid to liquid without altering the chemical composition of the wax. Therefore, the correct choice is that both changes are only physical changes, as they do not involve any chemical reactions or transformations."

Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Cracks forming in concrete due to changes in temperature is a physical change. The concrete looks different, but it is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""physical change"" because the cracking of concrete due to temperature fluctuations alters its appearance and structure without changing its chemical composition. The material remains concrete, and the changes are reversible; for example, the cracks could be repaired. In contrast, a chemical change would involve a transformation that alters the substance at the molecular level, such as rusting or burning. Therefore, the correct classification for the phenomenon described is a physical change."
	Which is a run-on sentence?	"[""He won't get lost, I will give him directions."", 'Goes on a big adventure.']"	0		closed choice	grade3	language science	writing-strategies	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is it a complete sentence, a fragment, or a run-on?	"A sentence is a group of words that forms a complete thought. It has both a subject and a verb.
My friends walk along the path.
A sentence fragment is a group of words that does not express a complete thought. It is usually missing a subject or a verb.

This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a subject.
Who knows the answer? She knows the answer.
The bright red car.
This is a sentence fragment. It is missing a verb.
What did the bright red car do? The bright red car stopped.
A run-on sentence is made up of two sentences that are joined without end punctuation or with just a comma.
I knocked on the door it opened.
It started raining, we ran inside.
To fix a run-on sentence, separate it into two sentences. Add end punctuation after the first sentence, and capitalize the second sentence.
I knocked on the door. It opened.
It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside."	He won't get lost, I will give him directions is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined by just a comma: He won't get lost and I will give him directions.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first choice, ""He won't get lost, I will give him directions,"" is indeed a run-on sentence because it improperly joins two independent clauses with just a comma, which is a grammatical error known as a comma splice. It requires a coordinating conjunction or a semicolon to be properly punctuated. The second choice, ""Goes on a big adventure,"" is not a complete sentence and therefore cannot be classified as a run-on. Thus, the correct answer is choice 0."

SOLUTION: The argument presented in the text dismisses Candice's claim about the Loch Ness Monster based on her lack of Scottish identity, rather than addressing the validity of her argument itself. This is a classic example of an ad hominem fallacy, where the critique is directed at the person rather than the argument they are making.

	How long does it take to cook a turkey in the oven?	['6 hours', '6 minutes']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose units of time	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that the bus leaves in 7. You might be thinking, 7 what? Does the bus leave in 7 minutes? 7 seconds?
The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to cook a turkey in the oven is 6 hours.
6 minutes is too fast."	"ANSWER: 6 hours  
SOLUTION: Cooking a turkey in the oven typically requires several hours, depending on its size and cooking temperature. A general guideline is to roast a turkey for about 13-15 minutes per pound at 350°F, which would add up to several hours for an average turkey. In contrast, 6 minutes is far too short to properly cook a turkey, which could lead to food safety issues. Therefore, 6 hours is the more reasonable estimate for cooking a turkey in the oven."
	Which meatball has a higher temperature?	['the meatball with less thermal energy', 'the meatball with more thermal energy']	1	Two meatballs are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two meatballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the meatball with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The temperature of an object is directly related to its thermal energy; specifically, an object with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature than one with less thermal energy. Since both meatballs are identical in terms of material and mass, the one with more thermal energy must have a higher temperature. Thus, the correct choice is the meatball with more thermal energy, which corresponds to option (1)."

Oliver, a cat from this group, does not have agouti fur. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Oliver has two alleles for not having agouti fur (a). So, Oliver's genotype for the agouti fur gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage states that Oliver does not have agouti fur and possesses two alleles for not having agouti fur. The allele representing the absence of agouti fur is denoted as 'a'. Since Oliver has two copies of this allele, his genotype is 'aa', which directly corresponds to the choice (1) provided in the options. The information clearly indicates that Oliver's genetic makeup for the agouti fur trait is homozygous recessive, confirming that he does not exhibit the agouti fur phenotype."

In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a normal-sized body (B) is dominant over the allele for a dwarf body (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a dwarf body or a normal-sized body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body, is dominant over the b allele, which is for a dwarf body.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to offspring with a normal-sized body is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with a dwarf body. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with a normal-sized body."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with a dwarf body to those with a normal-sized body from the described cross is 0:4. Since the B allele is dominant over the b allele, any offspring that inherit at least one B allele will exhibit a normal-sized body. In this cross, all offspring will be normal-sized (BB or Bb genotypes), and none will be dwarf (bb genotype). Thus, the correct answer is 0:4, indicating that no dwarf offspring are expected."

Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Dust settling out of the air is a physical change. As the dust settles, or falls, it might land on furniture or the ground. This separates dust particles from the air, but does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Both changes, carving a piece of wood and dust settling out of the air, are physical changes. In carving, the shape of the wood is altered without changing its chemical composition, while dust settling involves the physical separation of particles from the air without any chemical transformation. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes, as no new substances are formed in either process."
	Based on this information, what is Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait?	['wavy fur', 'straight fur']	0	"In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Nutmeg is a Syrian hamster from this group. Nutmeg has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Nutmeg's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nutmeg's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for wavy fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Nutmeg's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Nutmeg's genotype is homozygous recessive (ff), which means she carries two copies of the recessive allele for wavy fur. Since the wavy fur allele (f) is recessive to the straight fur allele (F), Nutmeg will express the trait associated with the recessive allele, which is wavy fur. Therefore, based on her genotype, Nutmeg's phenotype for the fur texture trait is wavy fur, corresponding to choice (0)."

['a gas', 'a liquid', 'a solid']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A slide is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own.
A slide has a size and shape of its own, even when you sit on it."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: A slide is classified as a solid because it maintains a definite shape and volume, characteristics that define solid materials. Unlike liquids, which take the shape of their container, or gases, which expand to fill their surroundings, a slide retains its structure regardless of external factors. Additionally, when someone sits on a slide, it does not change shape or flow, further confirming its status as a solid."

SOLUTION: To determine which motorboat was moving at the highest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each motorboat by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Each motorboat traveled for the same duration of 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 670 kilometers has the highest distance covered, resulting in a speed of 67 kilometers per hour. The other motorboats, moving 275 kilometers and 355 kilometers, have lower speeds of 27.5 kilometers per hour and 35.5 kilometers per hour, respectively.

The red wolf of the southeastern United States became extinct in the wild in 1980. After scientists created a breeding program with a few red wolves in captivity.
Here is one way to fix the sentence fragment:
The red wolf of the southeastern United States became extinct in the wild in 1980. After scientists created a breeding program with a few red wolves in captivity, the wolves were reintroduced to the wild."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text contains a sentence fragment, as the second sentence ""After scientists created a breeding program with a few red wolves in captivity"" does not form a complete thought and lacks a main clause. It begins with a subordinating conjunction (""After"") and fails to convey a complete idea independently. The proposed solution effectively connects the fragment to a complete thought, making it grammatically correct and coherent. Therefore, the answer is yes, there is a sentence fragment."
	What is the volume of a glass of milk?	['1 gallon', '1 cup', '1 fluid ounce']	1	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a glass of milk is 1 cup.
1 fluid ounce is too little and 1 gallon is too much."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The best estimate for the volume of a glass of milk is 1 cup because a standard glass typically holds around 8 ounces, which is equivalent to 1 cup. In contrast, 1 fluid ounce is significantly less than what one would expect in a glass, while 1 gallon is an excessive amount for a single serving. Therefore, 1 cup is the most reasonable choice when considering a typical serving size for a glass of milk."

['Felis margarita', 'Lynx canadensis', 'Neofelis nebulosa']	0	This organism is a sand cat. Its scientific name is Felis margarita.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A sand cat's scientific name is Felis margarita.
Felis margarita has the same scientific name as a sand cat. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Neofelis nebulosa does not have the same scientific name as a sand cat. So, Felis margarita and Neofelis nebulosa are not in the same species.
Lynx canadensis does not have the same scientific name as a sand cat. So, Felis margarita and Lynx canadensis are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The organism in the same species as the sand cat is Felis margarita, which is the scientific name for the sand cat itself. The other two choices, Lynx canadensis and Neofelis nebulosa, have different scientific names and therefore belong to different species. Since the task requires selecting the organism that is in the same species as the sand cat, the correct choice is option 0, Felis margarita."

In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele F is for a hairy fleece, and the allele f is for a woolly fleece.
Thistle, a sheep from this group, has a hairy fleece. Thistle has two alleles for a hairy fleece."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Thistle's observable version of the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece. So, Thistle's phenotype for the fleece type trait is a hairy fleece.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Thistle's phenotype for the fleece type trait is based on its observable characteristic, which is a hairy fleece. The text indicates that Thistle possesses two alleles for a hairy fleece, specifically the dominant allele F. Since the phenotype refers to the visible trait, and Thistle has a hairy fleece, the correct choice that represents this phenotype is (0) a hairy fleece."

A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells."	"Hard is a property. A hard material keeps its shape when you press on it with your finger.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine pushing on the material shown in each picture.
Of the choices, the icicle is harder. If you squeeze an icicle, it will not change shape, unless it starts to melt!"	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the hardness of two materials: a wool sweater and an icicle. Hardness is defined by a material's ability to retain its shape when pressure is applied. When considering an icicle, it is a solid that maintains its shape under pressure until it melts, whereas a wool sweater is soft and will compress when squeezed. Therefore, the icicle is harder than the wool sweater, leading to the conclusion that the correct choice is (1) icicle."
	"What kind of sentence is this?
Don't overlook Arianna when choosing the new principal."	['imperative', 'exclamatory', 'interrogative']	0		closed choice	grade6	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement, and it always ends with a period.
The nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.
An interrogative sentence is a question, and it always ends with a question mark.
Do you have any plans for the upcoming weekend?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something, and it usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.
For this assignment, use references to support your claims.
Don't drive so quickly in the construction zone!
An exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.
I can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!"	The sentence makes a request, so it is an imperative sentence. Here, it ends with a period.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Don't overlook Arianna when choosing the new principal"" is an imperative sentence because it issues a command or request to the listener, instructing them not to overlook Arianna in the decision-making process. Imperative sentences often begin with a verb and can end with a period or an exclamation point; in this case, it ends with a period. Unlike exclamatory or interrogative sentences, which express strong emotions or ask questions, imperative sentences focus on directing action."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Sword of Damocles is ancient legend.
According to legend, when Damocles wished his life were as full of luxuries as that of the tyrant Dionysis, Dionysis invited Damocles to a sumptuous banquet. Above Damocles' seat at the feast, Dionysis had placed a sword, suspended only by a thin hair, demonstrating the fragile nature of fortune.
The allusion Sword of Damocles means a reminder that one is vulnerable."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The allusion to the ""Sword of Damocles"" originates from an ancient legend rather than the Bible. This story illustrates the precariousness of fortune, as Damocles, who envied the tyrant Dionysis's luxurious life, was shown that such wealth comes with constant danger. The presence of the sword hanging by a thread serves as a metaphor for the vulnerability that accompanies great fortune, which is why the phrase is commonly used to signify looming threats or risks in seemingly favorable situations."

The simile as cold as ice suggests that the song is about someone who doesn't care. Someone who is as cold as ice is numb and doesn't have warm feelings."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The simile ""as cold as ice"" implies a lack of warmth or emotion, suggesting that the person in the song is emotionally distant or indifferent. This characterization aligns with the idea of someone who doesn't care about love or relationships, as they are willing to sacrifice their feelings. Therefore, the correct interpretation of the simile is that it reflects a person's emotional coldness rather than a literal state of being cold."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each goose moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each goose moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each goose moved for 10 hours. The goose that moved 650 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that goose must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which goose was moving at the highest speed, we calculate the speed of each goose by dividing the distance they traveled by the time taken. All three geese moved for the same duration of 10 hours. The goose that moved 650 miles south has the highest speed, calculated as 650 miles / 10 hours = 65 miles per hour, compared to the other geese, which traveled at 36 miles per hour and 27.5 miles per hour, respectively. Therefore, the second goose, moving 650 miles south, is the fastest."

SOLUTION: The phrase ""old news"" is indeed an example of an oxymoron, as it juxtaposes the concept of ""old,"" which suggests something outdated, with ""news,"" which typically refers to recent information. This contradiction emphasizes the speaker's sentiment that Trent's departure is no longer surprising or relevant. In contrast, a euphemism would involve using a milder or less abrasive term to refer to something harsh or unpleasant, which is not applicable in this context.

Kenneth will give up the chance to get a free waffle cone. He would have enjoyed the waffle cone."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The choice (1) represents a cost because it illustrates what Kenneth is giving up by choosing cherries jubilee ice cream instead of brownie batter. Although he prefers the cherries jubilee flavor, he must forgo the free waffle cone that comes with the brownie batter. This lost opportunity to enjoy the waffle cone is a tangible cost associated with his decision, as it reflects a sacrifice of something he would have liked.

The first text uses unique in its nontraditional sense: interesting or unusual. Samantha is a distinctive artist, but might not be one of a kind. It may be helpful to remember that if unique is modified by an adverb—as in most unique, very unique, or quite unique—it is probably being used nontraditionally.

SOLUTION: The second text clearly uses the word ""unique"" in its traditional sense, indicating that each vase and bowl is the only one of its kind, reflecting Samantha's individual artistic style. This aligns with the definition of uniqueness as being distinct and non-replicable. In contrast, the first text uses ""unique"" in a nontraditional way, suggesting that Samantha is interesting or noteworthy rather than one of a kind, particularly as it employs the modifier ""most,"" which is generally seen as improper in the context of the word unique.

A bar graph can be used to show the average amount of precipitation each month. Months with taller bars have more precipitation on average."	"To describe the average precipitation trends in New Orleans, look at the graph.
Choice ""Feb"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Jun"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Jul"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Aug"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Oct"" is incorrect.
Choice ""The wettest months of the year are June, July, and August."" is incorrect.
On average, more precipitation falls during June, July, and August than during other months of the year. So, June, July, and August are the wettest months.
Choice ""February is wetter than June."" is incorrect.
February has a lower average precipitation than June. So, February is drier, not wetter, than June.
Choice ""October is the wettest month."" is incorrect.
Every other month has a higher average precipitation than October. So, October is the driest, not the wettest, month."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The statement ""The wettest months of the year are June, July, and August"" accurately reflects the average monthly precipitation trends in New Orleans, as these months typically receive more rainfall than any other months. The other choices incorrectly identify October as the wettest month and claim that February is wetter than June, both of which contradict the usual precipitation patterns observed in New Orleans. Therefore, choice (0) is the best description of the average monthly precipitation in the city."

Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion We're not in Kansas anymore is a movie.
In the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy, a young farm girl from Kansas, finds herself in Oz, an unusual place that looks nothing like her home. She says to her dog, ""Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.""
The allusion We're not in Kansas anymore means we're in an unfamiliar place."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The allusion ""We're not in Kansas anymore"" originates from the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz, making it a reference to a movie rather than a fable. In the film, the line signifies a shift to an unfamiliar and fantastical environment, which is central to the story's theme of adventure and discovery. The context provided in the sentence highlights this transition to a vibrant and different setting, reinforcing that the source of the allusion is film-based. Therefore, the correct choice is (0) a movie."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	"[""As Brad's train pulled out of the station, Ted waved goodbye to him."", 'Ted waved goodbye to Brad as his train pulled out of the station.']"	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun his could refer to Ted or Brad.
Ted waved goodbye to Brad as his train pulled out of the station.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
As Brad's train pulled out of the station, Ted waved goodbye to him."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice, ""Ted waved goodbye to Brad as his train pulled out of the station,"" contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""his"" could refer to either Ted or Brad. This ambiguity makes it unclear whose train is being referenced. In contrast, the first answer choice clarifies the reference by specifying ""Brad's train,"" thus eliminating any confusion regarding who the pronoun refers to and making the meaning clear."

A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A Grevy's zebra's scientific name is Equus grevyi.
Cervus canadensis does not have the same scientific name as a Grevy's zebra. So, Equus grevyi and Cervus canadensis are not in the same species.

The allusion an albatross around her neck means a burden a person must bear."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The allusion ""an albatross around her neck"" originates from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner."" In the poem, the albatross symbolizes a heavy burden resulting from guilt and wrongdoing. The phrase has since entered common usage to denote a persistent burden or problem that one must carry. Therefore, the source of the allusion is a poem, making choice (0) the correct answer."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
acid rain weathering a marble statue
chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Acid rain weathering a marble statue is a chemical change. The acid rain reacts with the outside of the statue and breaks it down into a different type of matter. This new matter is then washed away by the rain. Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when smoke from automobiles and factories mixes with water in clouds.
Acid rain is a type of pollution. It forms when automobiles and factories release smoke containing sulfur or nitrogen. Some of these chemicals react with water in the atmosphere. The reaction forms droplets of water that can fall back to the ground as acid rain.
Chemicals in a battery reacting to power a flashlight is a chemical change. When the flashlight is turned on, the chemicals in the battery react with each other to form new chemicals. This creates electricity, which powers the lightbulb.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both changes involve chemical reactions that result in the formation of new substances. Acid rain weathering a marble statue alters the composition of the marble due to the reaction with acidic components, while the chemicals in a battery react to produce electricity and power a flashlight. Since both scenarios involve changes at the molecular level and result in different materials or forms being produced, they are classified as chemical changes."
	Select the gas.	['bat bones', 'air inside a raft', 'pair of dice', 'water in a fishbowl']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A pair of dice is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. When you roll a pair of dice, the dice have a shape of their own. They are still cubes when they stop rolling.
The air inside a raft is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air in a raft expands to fill all the space inside the raft. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the raft.
A bat bone is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A bat bone has its own shape inside the bat.
The water in a fishbowl is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour water from a fishbowl into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container. But the water will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The correct choice is ""air inside a raft,"" which is a gas. Gases, unlike solids and liquids, do not have a fixed shape and will expand to fill the entire volume of their container. In this case, the air inside the raft fills all the available space. The other options, such as bat bones and a pair of dice, are solids, while water in a fishbowl is a liquid, making them incorrect choices for the task of selecting a gas."

SOLUTION: The Belize Barrier Reef is characterized by bright sunlight and shallow water, which are typical features of tropical coral reef ecosystems. These conditions promote the growth of diverse marine life and coral species. In contrast, the first choice incorrectly states that the reef has only a few types of organisms, which does not align with the rich biodiversity found in the Belize Barrier Reef.

Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Aunt Becky is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter is ""Dear Aunt Becky,"" with ""Dear"" capitalized as it is the first word of the greeting, and it is followed by a comma. In contrast, ""dear Aunt Becky,"" has the first word in lowercase, which is incorrect for a formal letter greeting. Proper nouns, like ""Aunt Becky,"" should also be capitalized, and in this case, ""Aunt Becky"" is correctly capitalized in the first choice. Hence, the first greeting is the appropriate format for a letter."

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

"	The text argues that being socially awkward determines knowledge of workplace safety. This is a personal attack that isn't relevant to Mr. Conway's desire to prevent workplace injuries. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as ad hominem.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text employs an ad hominem fallacy, which is evident in the attack on Mr. Conway's character rather than addressing his argument about workplace safety. By doubting his knowledge based on his social awkwardness, the statement distracts from the actual issue at hand—workplace injuries and fatalities. This personal attack undermines the validity of Mr. Conway's argument without providing any logical counterpoints, making it a clear example of the ad hominem fallacy."

A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether a drum is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a drum something you can touch? Yes.
Is a drum a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a drum is a good."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A drum is classified as a good because it is a physical object that can be touched and owned. Unlike services, which involve actions performed by someone else (like teaching or repairing), a drum is a tangible item that you can purchase and use. Therefore, based on the criteria of being a physical item versus an action, a drum clearly falls into the category of a good."

SOLUTION: The statement in the text relies on the notion that popularity equates to trustworthiness, which is a classic example of the bandwagon fallacy. This fallacy assumes that if many people believe something or engage with it, it must be correct or reliable.

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

160 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: 160 milliliters  
SOLUTION: A typical paper drinking cup, such as those used for beverages in restaurants or cafeterias, generally holds around 200 to 300 milliliters. Therefore, 160 milliliters is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a smaller paper cup. In contrast, 160 liters is an excessively large volume, far exceeding the standard capacity of paper cups, which makes it an unsuitable choice.

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

rust forming on a metal gate"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Making paper from wood is a chemical change. Paper is made by mixing tiny pieces of wood with special chemicals. The wood reacts with the chemicals to form pulp. Wood and pulp are different types of matter.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both changes, making paper from wood and rust forming on a metal gate, are chemical changes. In making paper, the wood undergoes a chemical reaction with chemicals to create pulp, resulting in a new substance. Similarly, rusting is a chemical reaction where iron reacts with oxygen and moisture to form rust, a different substance from the original metal. Thus, the correct choice is that both are chemical changes."

The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnets will attract each other because they are positioned with opposite poles facing one another. The south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet, and according to magnetic principles, opposite poles attract.

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)

SOLUTION: The statement is true because the volume of Uranus is approximately 6.83 x 10^13 km^3, while ten times the volume of Neptune (which is around 6.25 x 10^13 km^3) equals 6.25 x 10^14 km^3. When comparing these two values, it's clear that the volume of Uranus (6.83 x 10^13 km^3) is indeed less than ten times the volume of Neptune (6.25 x 10^14 km^3). Therefore, the assertion in the statement holds true."

3,700 millimeters, 3,700 centimeters, and 3,700 meters are all too short."	"ANSWER: 3,700 kilometers  
SOLUTION: The Mississippi River is approximately 3,734 kilometers long, making 3,700 kilometers the best estimate among the choices provided. The other options—3,700 millimeters, 3,700 meters, and 3,700 centimeters—are significantly shorter than the actual length of the river. Therefore, 3,700 kilometers is the only option that realistically represents the river's length."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?	['Sophia asked Anna to make a flourless chocolate cake for their book club meeting because she has a gluten allergy.', 'Because Anna has a gluten allergy, Sophia asked her to make a flourless chocolate cake for their book club meeting.']	0		closed choice	grade11	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The first answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun she could refer to Sophia or Anna.
Sophia asked Anna to make a flourless chocolate cake for their book club meeting because she has a gluten allergy.
The second answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Because Anna has a gluten allergy, Sophia asked her to make a flourless chocolate cake for their book club meeting."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose answer 0 because it contains a vague pronoun reference with the pronoun ""she,"" which could refer to either Sophia or Anna, creating ambiguity in the sentence. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion about who has the gluten allergy. In contrast, answer 1 eliminates this ambiguity by clearly stating that Anna is the one with the gluten allergy, thus providing a more precise and understandable reference."

['Erinaceus concolor', 'Erinaceus europaeus']	1	The European hedgehog is found in many parts of western Europe. It often lives in people's gardens. This hedgehog's scientific name refers to the continent it lives on.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Origins of scientific names	"When a scientist identifies a new organism, he or she chooses its scientific name.
Sometimes, an organism is named after the place where it was first found. Other times, an organism is named after the scientist who first identified it. Or, the scientific name might describe the organism's physical traits.
Many of the words that make up scientific names are based on words from old languages, like Latin and classical Greek. Sometimes, English words are changed to make them sound more like Latin or Greek. The new words are then used in an organism's scientific name."	"This organism's scientific name refers to Europe, the continent it lives on.
The word europaeus refers to Europe. So, the European hedgehog's scientific name is Erinaceus europaeus."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The scientific name for the European hedgehog is Erinaceus europaeus, where ""europaeus"" directly references Europe, the continent where this species is primarily found. The hint mentions that the hedgehog is commonly seen in gardens across western Europe, reinforcing the connection to its name. In contrast, Erinaceus concolor refers to a different species known as the white-bellied hedgehog, which is not specific to Europe. Therefore, the correct choice is Erinaceus europaeus, corresponding to the European hedgehog."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
carving a piece of wood
crushing a mineral into powder"	['Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Carving a piece of wood is a physical change. The wood changes shape, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Crushing a mineral into powder is a physical change. The mineral breaks into tiny pieces. But it is still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both carving a piece of wood and crushing a mineral into powder are examples of physical changes, as neither process alters the chemical composition of the materials involved. In both cases, the original matter remains the same; it simply changes form or size. This is distinct from chemical changes, where new substances with different properties are created. Therefore, the correct answer is that both changes are only physical changes."
	Select the liquid.	['crayons', 'slide', 'dish soap', 'coins']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"A coin is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. Many coins are made of solid metal.
A crayon is a solid. You can break a crayon into pieces. But each piece will still have a size and shape of its own.
Dish soap is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour dish soap out of a bottle, the dish soap will change shape. But the dish soap will still take up the same amount of space.
A slide is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A slide has a size and shape of its own, even when you sit on it."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose dish soap (option 2) as the liquid because it is defined as a substance that takes the shape of its container and does not have a fixed shape or size. Unlike solids such as crayons, coins, and slides, which maintain their shape, dish soap can flow and adjust to the form of the bottle or surface it is on. This characteristic of liquids allows them to change shape while still occupying a consistent volume, which is not true for the other options listed."

O happy dagger is a direct address to the dagger, a nonhuman entity."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text employs apostrophe as it directly addresses the dagger, which is an inanimate object. By calling it ""O happy dagger,"" the speaker personifies the dagger and attributes emotional significance to it, creating a dramatic effect. This figure of speech enhances the intensity of the moment, as the speaker is expressing a profound connection to the dagger in a moment of despair. In contrast, a euphemism would involve a more gentle or indirect expression, which is not the case here."

	"Which tense does the sentence use?
Edwin will make cookies with his friends."	['present tense', 'past tense', 'future tense']	2		closed choice	grade5	language science	verbs	Verb tense	Is the sentence in the past, present, or future tense?	"Present tense verbs tell you about something that is happening now.
Most present-tense verbs are regular. They have no ending, or they end in -s or -es.
Two verbs are irregular in the present tense, to be and to have. You must remember their forms.
Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.
Present | Past | Future
walk, walks | walked | will walk
go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, make. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Edwin will make cookies with his friends"" clearly indicates a future action due to the presence of the auxiliary verb ""will"" before the main verb ""make."" This construction is a common way to express future intentions or plans in English. The use of ""will"" signifies that the action has not yet occurred but is expected to take place at a later time. Therefore, the correct tense used in this sentence is future tense."

Although a newer sense of the word may be more commonly used, many people consider a word's traditional definition to be the correct usage. Being able to distinguish the different uses of a word can help you use it appropriately for different audiences.
Britney perused her notes, carefully preparing for her exam.

David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The second text uses terribly in its traditional sense: in a terrible manner.
Raymond shivered terribly as he gazed at the snow-clad slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Raymond shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the second text uses ""terribly"" to describe how Raymond shivered, indicating he shivered in a terrible manner, which aligns with the traditional sense of the word. In contrast, the first text uses ""terribly"" to amplify the steepness of the slope, which reflects a nontraditional usage meaning ""extremely"" or ""very."" This distinction is important as it highlights the traditional versus nontraditional meanings of the word ""terribly,"" with the second text adhering to standard usage."

Falco tinnunculus is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco tinnunculus and Falco sparverius are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The American kestrel's scientific name is Falco sparverius, which indicates that it belongs to the genus Falco. Among the provided choices, Falco tinnunculus also belongs to the genus Falco, making it the only organism listed that shares the same genus as the American kestrel. In contrast, Ardea herodias and Ardea cinerea belong to the genus Ardea, so they do not match the genus of the American kestrel. Therefore, the correct answer is choice 1."

The simile like the parched earth during a drought suggests that Martha's hands were dry and cracked. A drought is a period without rain; the ground during a drought can become hard and cracked."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The simile in the text compares Martha's hands to parched earth during a drought, suggesting that her hands are very dry and possibly damaged, much like how the ground becomes hard and cracked when it lacks water. The imagery evokes a sense of extreme dryness and lack of moisture, leading to the conclusion that her hands are not only dry but may also be cracked. Option (1), which suggests that Martha was baking something, does not align with the implication of dryness conveyed by the simile."

Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 5 hours. The motorboat that moved 280 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: To determine which motorboat was moving at the highest speed, we calculate the speed of each motorboat by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. All three motorboats traveled for the same duration of 5 hours. The first motorboat traveled 280 kilometers, which gives a speed of 56 kilometers per hour (280 km / 5 h). The second motorboat traveled 60 kilometers, resulting in a speed of 12 kilometers per hour (60 km / 5 h), and the third motorboat moved 100 kilometers, corresponding to a speed of 20 kilometers per hour (100 km / 5 h).

Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma. Aunt Emma is capitalized because it is a proper noun."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter is ""Dear Aunt Emma,"" as it starts with a capital ""D"" and follows the standard convention for letter salutations. In formal writing, the first word of the greeting must always be capitalized, and it should end with a comma. The phrase ""dear Aunt Emma,"" with a lowercase ""d,"" does not adhere to these rules and is therefore incorrect.

Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.

"Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea and the rotifer. The water flea are the rotifer are both primary consumers, so the black crappie is a secondary consumer.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the rotifer. The rotifer is a primary consumer, so the copepod is a secondary consumer.
The golden algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer.
The green algae does not have any arrows pointing to it, so it is not a secondary consumer."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The black crappie is identified as a secondary consumer in the food web because it has arrows pointing to it from primary consumers, specifically the water flea and the rotifer. These primary consumers, which feed on producers, transfer energy to the black crappie, indicating its role as a secondary consumer. In contrast, both green algae and golden algae do not have arrows pointing to them, meaning they are producers and not consumers in this context.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that the magnets in Pair 1 have a larger Magnet B compared to Pair 2, where Magnet B is smaller. Since both pairs consist of magnets made from the same material, the size difference directly affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. Although the magnets in Pair 2 attract and those in Pair 1 repel, the direction of the force does not influence its magnitude. Therefore, the larger Magnet B in Pair 1 results in a greater magnetic force compared to Pair 2, leading to the conclusion that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1."

SOLUTION: The passage provides specific information about the lack of rain over a one-week period at Nate's house, which is indicative of weather conditions. Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a particular area, including precipitation, temperature, and humidity. In contrast, climate describes the long-term average of weather patterns over extended periods.

Jupiter, a leopard from this group, has a black coat. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat (a). So, Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Jupiter has a black coat, which indicates that he possesses the recessive allele for the coat pattern gene, represented by the lowercase ""a."" Since it is stated that Jupiter has two alleles for a black coat, this confirms that he is homozygous for the recessive trait. Therefore, his genotype is ""aa,"" corresponding to choice (0)."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.

48 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 48

SOLUTION: The volume of a car's gas tank is typically measured in liters, with most standard vehicles having a tank capacity ranging from about 40 to 80 liters. The choice of 48 liters is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a gas tank, whereas 48 milliliters is far too small to be practical for a car's fuel capacity. Therefore, 48 liters is the better estimate, as it aligns with common automotive specifications."

SOLUTION: As the water balloon fell toward Ronald, its distance from the center of the Earth decreased. Gravitational potential energy is directly related to the height of an object above a reference point, which in this case is the ground level.

So, for every object on or near Earth, there is gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth.
The amount of gravitational potential energy stored between an object and Earth depends on the mass of the object. The amount of gravitational potential energy also depends on the distance between the object and the center of Earth. This distance increases when the object moves higher and decreases when the object moves lower.
If the distance between an object and the center of Earth changes, the gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth will change. The table below shows how this change can happen.
When an object's mass stays the same and its distance from the center of Earth... | Gravitational potential energy stored between the object and Earth...
increases | increases
decreases | decreases
stays the same | stays the same"	"Think about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Sandeep was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Sandeep, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Sandeep."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: As the water balloon fell toward Sandeep, its distance from the center of the Earth decreased. Gravitational potential energy is directly related to the height of an object above a reference point, which in this case is the Earth's center. Since the water balloon was moving downward, the height was decreasing, leading to a decrease in gravitational potential energy. Thus, the correct choice is that the gravitational potential energy decreased as the water balloon fell."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
a penny tarnishing
firing a clay pot in a hot kiln"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	2		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. A penny tarnishing is a chemical change. When air touches the penny, the surface of the penny changes into a different type of matter. This matter makes the penny dull.
Firing a clay pot in a hot kiln is a chemical change. High temperatures cause the clay to slowly harden. After several hours in the kiln, the clay will have changed into a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Firing clay is caused by heating. But a penny tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Both changes are chemical changes. A penny tarnishing involves a reaction with air that alters the surface of the metal, resulting in a dull appearance, which is a chemical transformation. Similarly, firing a clay pot in a kiln causes a chemical change as the heat transforms the clay into a harder, more durable material. Therefore, the commonality between the two changes is that they both involve a change in the chemical composition of the materials involved."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Over thousands of years, the river dried up, and the area became a desert. In the desert, sediment was deposited by wind."	closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	How do rock layers form?	"Material that is carried by wind, water, or ice is called sediment. Sediment may be deposited, or laid down, in places such as deserts and the ocean floor. Different types of sediment are deposited in different environments. For example, sand may be deposited in a desert, and mud may be deposited at the bottom of the ocean.
The environment of an area can change over thousands of years. When the environment changes, the type of sediment that is deposited also changes. Over a long period of time, different layers of sediment can build up in the same area. These layers preserve a record of the environments that existed in that area in the past.
As many layers of sediment build up, they can be pressed together to form layers of sedimentary rock. A series of rock layers is called a rock sequence. You can observe the layers of a rock sequence to learn more about how an area's environment changed over time."	"The environment in the area changed over time. Use the pictures to figure out the type of sediment deposited in each environment.
Later, the area became a desert. A layer of sand was deposited by wind."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sediment deposited in the area changed from a layer of sand and pebbles, which was characteristic of the fast-flowing river environment, to a layer of sand once the area transitioned to a desert. The information indicates that in the initial phase, heavier sediment grains like sand and pebbles were deposited by the river, whereas later, as the river dried up and the environment became a desert, only sand was deposited by wind. Thus, the correct sequence is that first, a layer of sand and pebbles was deposited, and later, a layer of sand was deposited."

As Leo sat down on the rickety old chair, it abruptly collapsed beneath him."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence is classified as complex because it contains one independent clause: ""it abruptly collapsed beneath him,"" and one dependent clause: ""As Leo sat down on the rickety old chair."" The presence of the subordinating conjunction ""as"" indicates that the second part of the sentence cannot stand alone, which is a key characteristic of complex sentences. This structure allows for a more nuanced relationship between the actions described."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each bowhead whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bowhead whale moved 25 miles in 5 hours.
The other bowhead whale moved 20 miles in 5 hours.
Notice that each bowhead whale spent the same amount of time moving. The bowhead whale that moved 25 miles moved a farther distance in that time. So, that bowhead whale must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose option 0 because it represents the bowhead whale that moved 25 miles in 5 hours, which calculates to a speed of 5 miles per hour (25 miles / 5 hours). In comparison, the other bowhead whale that moved 20 miles in the same time frame has a speed of 4 miles per hour (20 miles / 5 hours). Since both whales traveled for the same duration, the one that covered more distance (25 miles) clearly had a higher speed."
	Based on this information, what is Buck's genotype for the coat pattern gene?	['white spots', 'aa']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for solid coloring, and the allele a is for white spots.
Buck, a cow from this group, has white spots. Buck has two alleles for white spots."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Buck has two alleles for white spots (a). So, Buck's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Buck has white spots, which indicates that he possesses the recessive phenotype associated with the allele 'a'. Since he has two alleles for white spots, this signifies that his genotype must be homozygous for the recessive trait, represented as 'aa'. Therefore, his genotype for the coat pattern gene is indeed 'aa', confirming that he has inherited both alleles for the white spots phenotype."

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The second press release is more formal. It uses more elevated language (area musicians, top honors). The other press release uses idioms (battle it out) and abbreviations (Nov.).	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second press release is more formal due to its use of complete words and a more structured tone. Phrases like ""Middletown Amphitheater"" and ""area musicians vying for top honors"" convey a sense of professionalism and seriousness. Conversely, the first press release employs casual language with idiomatic expressions like ""battle it out"" and uses an abbreviation for ""November,"" which contributes to a more informal tone. This contrast illustrates the differing levels of formality in the two press releases."

The sister's running and a cheetah's running are compared using the word like.
A cheetah is known for running fast, so the simile means that the sister also runs fast.
The cat's fur was as dark as the night.
The cat's fur and the night are compared using the word as.
The night is dark, so the simile means that the cat's fur is also dark.
A metaphor compares two things by saying that one of them is the other. Unlike similes, metaphors don't use the word like or as.
The snow formed a blanket over the town.
The snow and a blanket are compared without the word like or as.
A blanket is a large piece of cloth that completely covers a bed. The metaphor makes the reader imagine that the snow becomes a blanket, covering the town completely.
Using similes and metaphors in your writing can help you create an interesting picture for the reader."	"Zack swam with ease across the swimming pool, like a dolphin.
The words Zack and dolphin are compared using the word like. So, the sentence uses a simile."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence compares Zack's swimming ability to that of a dolphin using the word ""like,"" which is a clear indicator of a simile. Similes explicitly make comparisons between two different things using ""like"" or ""as,"" while metaphors do so without these words. Since the comparison here uses ""like,"" it qualifies as a simile, confirming that the correct choice is 0."

3 millimeters and 3 centimeters are too short. 3 kilometers is too long."	"ANSWER: 3 meters  
SOLUTION: A sandbox typically has dimensions that allow for children to play comfortably, and 3 meters is a reasonable estimate for its length. The other options, such as 3 millimeters and 3 centimeters, are too small to accommodate play, while 3 kilometers is excessively large for a sandbox. Therefore, 3 meters stands out as the most practical and realistic choice for the length of a sandbox."

['South America', 'Asia', 'Africa']	2		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Asia or South America.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The prime meridian is defined as the line of longitude at 0°, which runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It passes through several countries in Africa, including Ghana and Uganda, making it the only continent that the prime meridian intersects. In contrast, it does not cross through Asia or South America, as these continents are located farther east or west of this line. Thus, the correct choice is Africa, represented by the number 2."

Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that chloroform is composed of three chemical elements: hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine. Since chloroform is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, chloroform is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Chloroform is classified as a compound because it consists of more than one type of element bonded together. In this case, the molecule is made up of hydrogen, carbon, and chlorine atoms. Since an elementary substance is defined as a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances and consists of only one type of atom, chloroform does not meet this criterion.

This is a classic example of a hasty generalization, as it draws a broad conclusion based on insufficient evidence—namely, the actions of a single person. Therefore, the conclusion that all millennials are lazy lacks the necessary support and fails to consider the diversity and complexity of individuals within the generation."

A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Omnivores are consumers that eat both producers and other consumers. So, an omnivore has arrows pointing to it from at least one producer and at least one consumer.
The phytoplankton does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the phytoplankton is not an omnivore.
The plainfin midshipman has an arrow pointing to it from the phytoplankton, which is a producer. The plainfin midshipman also has an arrow pointing to it from the zooplankton, which is a consumer. The plainfin midshipman eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.
The kelp does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the kelp is not an omnivore.
The kelp bass has an arrow pointing to it from the kelp, which is a producer. The kelp bass also has arrows pointing to it from the zooplankton, the plainfin midshipman, and the black rockfish, which are consumers. The kelp bass eats a producer and consumers, so it is an omnivore.
The sea urchin has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the kelp, which is a producer. So, the sea urchin is a consumer but not an omnivore."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The plainfin midshipman (choice 0) is identified as an omnivore because it consumes both the producer phytoplankton and the consumer zooplankton, which is indicated by the arrows pointing to it. The other options, such as the sea urchin, phytoplankton, and kelp, either consume only producers or have no arrows pointing to them, disqualifying them from being omnivores. The kelp bass is also an omnivore, but since the question specifically asks for the omnivore among the choices provided, the correct answer is the plainfin midshipman."
	"What kind of sentence is this?
That's his fourth touchdown in the game!"	['interrogative', 'exclamatory']	1		closed choice	grade4	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement. It tells about something. A declarative sentence always ends with a period.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
An interrogative sentence is a question. It asks something. An interrogative sentence always ends with a question mark.
How tall are you?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something. An imperative sentence usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.
Read the first chapter by next week.
Look out for that car!
An exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.
Some whales are over ninety feet long!

SOLUTION: The given sentence expresses a strong emotion or excitement about a specific achievement, which is characteristic of exclamatory sentences. It conveys enthusiasm regarding the subject (the fourth touchdown) and concludes with an exclamation mark, further indicating the heightened emotion. In contrast, an interrogative sentence would pose a question and typically end with a question mark, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct classification is exclamatory."

"	The text argues that an increase in the global average temperature causes less piracy. However, that's not necessarily true. The fact that piracy decreased as global average temperature increased does not mean that hotter weather reduces piracy. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as false causation.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The argument presented in the text suggests a causal relationship between rising global temperatures and a decrease in piracy, without sufficient evidence to support that conclusion. This is a classic example of false causation, where the correlation between two events is mistaken for a cause-and-effect relationship. Just because two trends occur simultaneously does not imply that one directly influences the other; other factors could be at play. Thus, option (0) is the correct identification of the logical fallacy used in the text."

Sulfur dioxide is a poisonous gas that is released into the atmosphere when volcanoes erupt.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.
In a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color.

You know from Step 1 that sulfur dioxide is composed of two chemical elements: oxygen and sulfur. Since sulfur dioxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, sulfur dioxide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Sulfur dioxide is classified as a compound because it consists of two different chemical elements: sulfur and oxygen. In the model, the presence of both sulfur and oxygen atoms bonded together indicates that it is not a single elemental substance but rather a combination of elements. Thus, the fact that it is made up of multiple types of atoms confirms that sulfur dioxide is a compound."

Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Birdie has one allele for white legs (L) and one allele for yellow legs (l). So, Birdie's genotype for the leg color gene is Ll.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Birdie's genotype for the leg color gene is represented by the combination of alleles she possesses. Since Birdie has one allele for white legs (L) and one allele for yellow legs (l), her genotype is Ll. The choices provided include a representation of the genotype (0) Ll and (1) white legs; thus, the correct choice for Birdie's genotype is (0) Ll.

Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that the magnets in Pair 1 have a smaller distance between them compared to those in Pair 2. Since the magnitude of the magnetic force increases as the distance between magnets decreases, this means that the magnetic force in Pair 1 is greater. Although the nature of the interaction (attraction or repulsion) does not affect the magnitude of the force, the proximity of the magnets in Pair 1 leads to a stronger force compared to Pair 2.

Justine adores the classic Renaissance style of the Rialto Bridge in Venice. She was surprised to learn that the bridge remains functional even though it is literally a million years old.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word literally because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first text uses the word ""literally"" in its traditional sense, referring to the factual age of the Rialto Bridge, which is indeed hundreds of years old. In contrast, the second text's claim that the bridge is ""literally a million years old"" is an exaggeration and does not reflect reality, thus misusing the term. The traditional use of ""literally"" emphasizes accuracy and factuality, which aligns with the first text, while the second text employs it in a hyperbolic manner."

The first text uses terribly in its nontraditional sense: extremely; very.
Cole shivered as he gazed at the terribly steep, snowy slope. After calming his nerves, he began his descent.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word terribly because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the second text employs ""terribly"" to describe the steepness of the slope, aligning with its traditional meaning of ""in a terrible manner."" In contrast, the first text uses ""terribly"" to indicate an extreme degree of shivering, which reflects a more modern and nontraditional use of the term.

	Which pot of spaghetti sauce has more thermal energy?	['the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce', 'the colder pot of spaghetti sauce']	0	Two pots of spaghetti sauce are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two pots of spaghetti sauce are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, assuming mass and specific heat capacity are constant. In this case, since both pots of spaghetti sauce are identical in material and mass, the pot with the higher temperature will have greater thermal energy. Therefore, the hotter pot of spaghetti sauce, being at a higher temperature, contains more thermal energy than the colder pot."

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The question asks about the relative magnetic force between two pairs of magnets. Since the magnetic force is inversely related to the distance between the magnets, the magnets in Pair 2, which are closer together, will exert a stronger magnetic force compared to those in Pair 1. Therefore, the correct answer is that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2. This conclusion is supported by the principle that proximity increases the strength of magnetic attraction or repulsion."

During photosynthesis, these organisms use light energy, carbon dioxide, and water to produce sugars and oxygen.
Photosynthetic organisms also often have the following characteristics:
They are producers, which are organisms that make their own food inside their cells. Because producers make their own food, they typically do not eat other organisms.
Their cells contain chloroplasts, which are cell structures where photosynthesis occurs.
Their chloroplasts often contain a green substance called chlorophyll. Chlorophyll captures light energy from the Sun to power photosynthesis.

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to their mass and speed. In this case, even though both samples have the same number of particles and the same average speed, the particles in sample A are more massive than those in sample B. Since kinetic energy is calculated using the formula \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), the higher mass of the particles in sample A results in a higher average kinetic energy compared to sample B. Consequently, sample A has the higher temperature."

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The trait of having a scar is considered an acquired trait because it results from an injury or accident that occurs during a person's life, rather than being passed down genetically from parents to children. Scars form as a response to the body's healing process after a wound, which is influenced by environmental factors.

sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: Both changes are classified as physical changes, as they involve a change in state or separation of mixtures without altering the chemical composition of the substances involved. Butter melting on a hot day changes from solid to liquid, while sediment settling involves the physical separation of particles from water. Neither process results in new substances being formed, which is a key characteristic of physical changes. Therefore, the correct choice is that both are only physical changes."

The Great Sphinx of Giza is a statue of a mythical sphinx, a creature with a lion's body and a human head. The Great Sphinx does not have all of the traits of a living thing. It does not grow or respond to the world around it. It does not need food or water.
A coral is a living thing.
Corals grow and respond to their environment. They need food and water. Corals are made up of many cells.
Corals are animals that live in the ocean. Most corals grow in warm water.
A globe is not a living thing.
Globes do not have all of the traits of living things. They do not grow or respond to their environment. They do not need food or water."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Coral is the only option listed that qualifies as a living thing. It exhibits key characteristics of life, such as growth and the ability to respond to its environment, and it requires food and water to survive. In contrast, the other options—globe, the Great Sphinx of Giza, and cell phone—are all inanimate objects that do not possess any traits associated with living organisms. Therefore, coral is the clear choice."

The correct title is Hair for Mama."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The title ""Hair for Mama"" is correctly capitalized according to title case rules, which dictate that the first and last words of the title, as well as all important words in between, should be capitalized. In this case, ""Hair"" and ""Mama"" are important words, while ""for"" is a preposition and does not need to be capitalized. Therefore, option (0) accurately reflects the correct formatting for a book title, while option (1) does not."
	What is the volume of a large soup pot?	['12 milliliters', '12 liters']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a large soup pot is 12 liters.
12 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 12 liters  
SOLUTION: A large soup pot typically holds a significant amount of liquid, usually measured in liters rather than milliliters. Given that 12 milliliters is an extremely small volume, it would not be practical for any large cooking vessel. In contrast, 12 liters is a reasonable estimate for the capacity of a large soup pot, as many pots designed for cooking soups and stews can hold anywhere from 5 to 15 liters or more. Thus, 12 liters is the better estimate for the volume of a large soup pot."

They have eight legs.
They have an exoskeleton.
They have no antennae. Observe the animals and read the descriptions."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Classification	Use evidence to classify animals	"Scientists sort animals with similar traits into groups. This is called classification. Classification helps scientists learn about how animals live.
How do scientists classify animals? First, they make observations about an animal. Scientists observe the animal's traits, including its body parts and behavior. Then, scientists compare the animal's traits to other animals' traits. Scientists classify animals with similar traits into a group."	"To decide if an animal is part of a group, look at the traits of the group.
Arachnids have the following traits:
They have eight legs.
They have an exoskeleton.
They have no antennae.
Compare each animal's traits to the group's traits. Select the animal with traits similar to the group's traits.
A castor bean tick has the following traits:
It has eight legs.
It has an exoskeleton.
It has no antennae.
A castor bean tick has the traits of an arachnid. A castor bean tick is an arachnid.
An earthworm has the following traits:
It has a soft, cylindrical body.
It has no limbs.
It is made up of segments.
An earthworm does not have all of the traits of an arachnid. An earthworm is a segmented worm."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the castor bean tick because it possesses all the traits that define arachnids: it has eight legs, a hard exoskeleton, and no antennae. In contrast, the earthworm does not fit the criteria as it has a soft body, no limbs, and is segmented, which are characteristics of worms rather than arachnids. Therefore, the castor bean tick is the only option that aligns with the arachnid traits mentioned."

China grows most of the wheat in the world."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause with a subject and a predicate. In the given choices, ""China grows most of the wheat in the world"" is a simple sentence because it contains one subject (""China"") and one predicate (""grows most of the wheat in the world""). On the other hand, ""Mrs. Thornton plants flower seeds, and they blossom in the spring"" is a compound sentence as it contains two independent clauses connected by a conjunction (""and"").

Impossible to put down means that the book is so good that it is hard to stop reading. The phrase impossible to put down is also a joke about anti-gravity: if gravity pulls things down, perhaps anti-gravity does the opposite and makes them impossible to put down."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs a pun, which is evident in the phrase ""impossible to put down."" This phrase cleverly plays on the concept of anti-gravity, suggesting that a book about anti-gravity would literally not be able to be put down due to the absence of gravitational pull. Simultaneously, it conveys the figurative meaning that the book is so engaging that readers find it hard to stop reading. This dual meaning exemplifies the humor characteristic of puns, making it the correct choice."

go, goes | went | will go"	The sentence is in future tense. You can tell because it uses will before the main verb, ride. The verb tells you about something that is going to happen.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Megan will ride horses on the ranch"" is in the future tense, indicated by the use of the auxiliary verb ""will"" preceding the main verb ""ride."" This construction demonstrates that the action of riding horses is intended to occur at a later time. The future tense is specifically used to describe actions that have not yet taken place but are expected to happen. Thus, the correct choice is (0) future tense."
	Which object has less thermal energy?

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two mugs of cocoa have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 30°C mug of cocoa is colder than the 35°C mug of cocoa, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The task involves comparing two identical objects, both 300-gram mugs of cocoa, but at different temperatures. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; therefore, the mug at 30°C has lower thermal energy compared to the mug at 35°C. Since thermal energy increases with temperature, the colder mug (30°C) possesses less thermal energy than the warmer one (35°C). Thus, the correct choice is the mug at 30°C, which is indicated by option (1)."
	Select the one substance that is not a mineral.	['Fluorite is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.', 'Wool is not a pure substance. It is a solid.', 'Baryte is a pure substance. It is formed in nature.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify minerals using properties	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Baryte is a mineral.
Wool is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, wool is not a mineral.
Fluorite is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Wool is not a mineral because it is not a pure substance; it is made up of various proteins and fibers that originate from animal sources. In contrast, both fluorite and baryte are classified as minerals since they are pure substances formed naturally in the earth. Minerals must meet specific criteria, including being naturally occurring and having a defined chemical composition, which wool does not satisfy. Therefore, wool is the only substance in the choices given that does not qualify as a mineral."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Sample A has particles that possess more mass compared to those in sample B, resulting in a higher average kinetic energy despite both samples having the same average speed. Since temperature is directly related to the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, the higher kinetic energy in sample A indicates that it has a higher temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is that sample A has the higher temperature."

As Noah sat down on the rickety old chair, it abruptly collapsed beneath him."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: The sentence ""As Noah sat down on the rickety old chair, it abruptly collapsed beneath him"" is classified as complex because it contains an independent clause (""it abruptly collapsed beneath him"") and a dependent clause (""As Noah sat down on the rickety old chair""). The presence of the subordinating conjunction ""as"" indicates the beginning of the dependent clause, which cannot stand alone as a complete sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is complex, which corresponds to choice (3)."

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to play the banjo. Instead, some people learn how to play. So, playing the banjo is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Playing the banjo is not a natural ability; it requires learning and practice. People must acquire the skill through instruction and experience, which means it is an acquired trait rather than an inherited one.

Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury"	The ad appeals to ethos, or character, by referring to real users who endorse the headphones.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The ad primarily utilizes ethos as it builds credibility by featuring real users who endorse the headphones. This approach appeals to the audience's trust in the character and reliability of those who have experienced the product, suggesting that because reputable figures support it, the product is worthy of consideration. By highlighting real user testimonials, the ad effectively establishes a connection with potential customers, reinforcing the brand's reliability and encouraging them to make a purchase based on the character of the endorsers."
	Suppose Andrew decides to take a trip to Georgia. Which result would be a cost?	['Andrew will save some money.

He would have enjoyed a trip to California more than Georgia.']	1	Andrew is deciding whether to take a trip to California or Georgia. He wants to enjoy his trip. But he is also trying to save money.	closed choice	grade4	social science	economics	Basic economic principles	Costs and benefits	"Before you decide to do something, it is often helpful to list costs and benefits.
Costs are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.
Benefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need."	"This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Andrew wants or needs:
Andrew will give up the chance to go to California. He would have enjoyed a trip to California more than Georgia."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The cost in this scenario is represented by the opportunity cost of not going to California, which Andrew perceives as a more enjoyable trip. While saving money on the plane tickets to Georgia is a financial benefit, the real cost comes from the lost enjoyment of the California trip that Andrew values more. Therefore, the choice to go to Georgia entails sacrificing the experience he would have preferred, making it a cost in the context of his decision-making."

The color, texture, and covering of an animal's skin are examples of adaptations. Animals' skins can be adapted in different ways. For example, skin with thick fur might help an animal stay warm. Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators."	"Look at the picture of the sharpnose-puffer.
The sharpnose-puffer has a poisonous body with brightly colored skin. Its skin is adapted to ward off predators. The bright colors serve as a warning sign that the sharpnose-puffer is poisonous.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The fire salamander has a poisonous body with brightly colored skin. Its skin is adapted to ward off predators.
The peppered moth has gray and brown patches on its body. Its skin is not adapted to be a warning sign that wards off predators."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose the fire salamander as the answer because it has a poisonous body and brightly colored skin, which serves as a warning sign to potential predators. This adaptation is similar to that of the sharpnose-puffer, which also uses bright colors to indicate toxicity. In contrast, the peppered moth does not have such a warning adaptation, as its coloration is more suited for camouflage rather than signaling danger. Thus, the fire salamander is the animal whose skin is better adapted to ward off predators."

	Is a loaf of bread a good or a service?	['a good', 'a service']	0		closed choice	grade2	social science	economics	Economics	Goods and services	"Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.
A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether a loaf of bread is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a loaf of bread something you can touch? Yes.
Is a loaf of bread a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a loaf of bread is a good."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A loaf of bread qualifies as a good because it is a tangible item that can be physically touched and consumed. It is not a service, which typically refers to activities or tasks performed by someone for someone else. In this case, bread is produced and sold as a product rather than a performance or an action. Therefore, the classification of a loaf of bread as a good is appropriate."

A catfish is an animal. It swims underwater.
A catfish is a fish. Unlike most other fish, catfish do not have scales! They have slimy skin."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the question specifically asks to select a plant, and among the given choices, only ""Aloe vera"" qualifies as a plant. The other options describe animals: barn owls, catfish, and toucans.

solid
found in nature
dark-colored
not made by living things
no fixed crystal structure
not a pure substance"	closed choice	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Rocks and minerals	Identify rocks and minerals	"Minerals are the building blocks of rocks. A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of basalt match the properties of a rock. So, basalt is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Basalt is classified as a rock because it is a solid material found in nature that does not have a fixed crystal structure and is not a pure substance. Unlike minerals, which are defined by specific chemical compositions and crystalline structures, basalt is an aggregate of various minerals and does not meet the criteria for being a mineral. Its dark color and formation through volcanic processes further support its classification as an igneous rock. Therefore, the correct answer is that basalt is a rock."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
erosion caused by wind
shaking up salad dressing"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	0		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Erosion caused by wind is a physical change. The wind carries away tiny pieces of rock. But the pieces of rock do not become a different type of matter.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Both erosion caused by wind and shaking up salad dressing are examples of physical changes. In both cases, the original materials retain their chemical composition; erosion simply involves the movement of particles, while shaking salad dressing mixes the components without altering their nature. Therefore, the correct answer is that both changes are only physical changes, as they do not result in new substances being formed."

SOLUTION: The task asks for an estimate of the time it takes to put on a seat belt. The choice of 5 seconds is significantly more reasonable than 5 minutes, as putting on a seat belt is a quick action that typically takes just a moment.

There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose option (1) because the explanation indicates that the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than that in Pair 1. Since the magnitude of the magnetic force decreases with increased distance, this means that the magnetic force is indeed smaller in Pair 2. The direction of the force (whether it is attractive or repulsive) does not influence the magnitude, which further supports that Pair 2 has a smaller force due to the larger distance between the magnets."

In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cucumber plants."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with bumpy fruit or smooth fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for bumpy fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for smooth fruit.
Bumpy fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with bumpy fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
Smooth fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A cucumber plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to offspring with smooth fruit is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with bumpy fruit. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with smooth fruit."	"ANSWER: 0:4  
SOLUTION: The problem states that the allele for bumpy fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for smooth fruit (f). Given that all offspring from the cross in the Punnett square have the genotype ff, it indicates that they all have smooth fruit. Since there are no offspring with the genotype FF or Ff, the expected ratio of offspring with bumpy fruit to smooth fruit is 0:4, meaning no bumpy fruit will be produced in this cross."

There are several things that can make overall supply go up or down. The table below shows how changes to these things might affect overall supply.
 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The number of men's clothing stores on Main Street decreased from seven to three, indicating a significant reduction in the number of suppliers available. With fewer stores selling men's shirts, it is likely that the overall supply of men's shirts in Burlington has diminished as well. This reduction in supply usually occurs when fewer retailers are present in a market, leading to less availability for consumers. Therefore, the supply of men's shirts probably went down."

The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase creeps up on you. It describes time as if it were a sneaky person.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the phrase ""creeps up on you"" because it personifies time by attributing to it a sneaky, almost stealthy behavior, as if it has the ability to move quietly and unexpectedly. This evokes a sense of inevitability and urgency, suggesting that time can catch a person off guard, much like a person might sneak up on another.

	"What do these two changes have in common?
burning a candle
burning a marshmallow over a campfire"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Burning a candle is a chemical change. Both the wick and the melted wax burn. They react with oxygen in the air and turn into soot, carbon dioxide, and water.
Burning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both burning a candle and burning a marshmallow are processes that involve heating, which leads to a chemical change. In each case, the application of heat causes the materials to react with oxygen and undergo transformations that produce new substances, such as carbon dioxide and soot from the candle, and charred remnants from the marshmallow. Therefore, the commonality between the two changes is that they are both caused by heating, making choice (1) the correct answer."

"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The magnetic force between magnets is influenced by the distance between them; the closer the magnets are, the stronger the force.

['N2H3', 'NH3', 'N2H4', 'NH']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Identify chemical formulas for ball-and-stick models	"Every substance around you is made up of atoms. Atoms can link together to form molecules. The links between atoms in a molecule are called chemical bonds. Different molecules are made up of different chemical elements, or types of atoms, bonded together.
Scientists use both ball-and-stick models and chemical formulas to represent molecules.
A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below.
The balls represent atoms. The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms. Balls that are different colors represent atoms of different elements. The element that each color represents is shown in the legend.
Every element has its own abbreviation, called its atomic symbol. Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.
The molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.
The chemical formula for a substance contains the atomic symbol for each element in the substance. Many chemical formulas also contain subscripts. A subscript is small text placed lower than the normal line of text. Each subscript in a chemical formula is placed after the symbol for an element and tells you how many atoms of that element that symbol represents. If there is no subscript after a symbol, that symbol represents one atom.
So, the chemical formula for a substance tells you which elements make up that substance. It also tells you the ratio of the atoms of those elements in the substance. For example, the chemical formula below tells you that there are three chlorine atoms for every one boron atom in the substance. This chemical formula represents the same substance as the ball-and-stick model shown above."	N is the symbol for nitrogen. According to the legend, nitrogen atoms are shown in blue. H is the symbol for hydrogen. According to the legend, hydrogen atoms are shown in light gray. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms. The chemical formula will contain the symbols N and H. There is one nitrogen atom, so N will not have a subscript. There are three hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 3. The correct formula is NH3. The diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The molecule described consists of one nitrogen atom and three hydrogen atoms, which corresponds to the chemical formula NH3. The question presents a ball-and-stick model where nitrogen is represented in blue and hydrogen in light gray, confirming the presence of these specific atoms. Since there is one nitrogen atom, it is represented simply as N, and with three hydrogen atoms, it is represented as H3, leading to the final formula NH3. This matches exactly with choice (1) provided in the options."

A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype LL for the leaf texture gene."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is LL. The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for fuzzy leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be fuzzy leaves."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The summer squash plant has a homozygous genotype of LL, which consists of two dominant alleles for the leaf texture trait. Since the allele for fuzzy leaves (L) is dominant over the allele for smooth leaves (l), the presence of the dominant L alleles indicates that the plant will exhibit the fuzzy leaf phenotype. Therefore, the correct choice for the plant's phenotype is fuzzy leaves, corresponding to the answer choice (1)."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two pots of spaghetti sauce have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 145°F pot of spaghetti sauce is colder than the 185°F pot of spaghetti sauce, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The pot of spaghetti sauce at 145°F has less thermal energy compared to the pot at 185°F because thermal energy is directly proportional to temperature. Since both pots are identical in mass and only differ in temperature, the one at the lower temperature (145°F) will contain less thermal energy than the one at the higher temperature (185°F). Therefore, the correct choice indicating less thermal energy is the first option (0)."

First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the thorns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.

The rose plant's genotype of Rr has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the thorns trait must be having thorns."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The rose plant has a heterozygous genotype of Rr for the thorns gene, where R (dominant) represents having thorns and r (recessive) represents not having thorns. Since the dominant allele is present in the genotype, the plant will express the dominant phenotype. Therefore, the phenotype for the thorns trait is ""having thorns,"" which corresponds to the choice represented by the number 0."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnetic force between magnets is inversely related to the distance separating them: the closer they are, the stronger the force. In this case, Pair 2 has magnets that are positioned closer together compared to Pair 1. Therefore, the magnetic force in Pair 2 is stronger than in Pair 1, making statement (0) the correct choice."

SOLUTION: The correct greeting for a letter is ""Dear Samuel,"" because it adheres to the conventions of capitalization in formal writing. In this case, ""Dear"" should be capitalized as it is the first word of the greeting, and ""Samuel"" must also be capitalized since it is a proper noun. Additionally, the greeting appropriately ends with a comma, which is standard in letter writing. The choice ""(1) Dear samuel,"" is incorrect due to the lack of capitalization for ""Samuel."""

The average precipitation for these three months is different. The average precipitation in August is more than an inch higher than the average precipitation in June and July."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The three months with the same average precipitation are December, January, and February. The analysis shows that while December has an average precipitation just over 2 inches, January and February have averages just under 2 inches, indicating that they do not share the same average. The other two choices, September, October, and November, and June, July, and August, also show differences in average precipitation.

	Which fish tank has a lower temperature?	['the fish tank with more thermal energy', 'the fish tank with less thermal energy']	1	Two fish tanks are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two fish tanks are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the fish tank with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The problem states that there are two identical fish tanks that differ only in their thermal energies. According to the principles of thermodynamics, temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance; therefore, the tank with less thermal energy will have its particles moving more slowly on average, resulting in a lower temperature. Thus, the fish tank with less thermal energy is the one that exhibits a lower temperature."

Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The little bittern has long, thin legs. Its legs are adapted for wading.
The African fish eagle has short legs. Its legs are not adapted for wading. The African fish eagle uses its legs to walk and perch."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the little bittern because it has long, thin legs that are specifically adapted for wading, similar to the shoebill. The text indicates that the shoebill's legs help it keep its body above water while it hunts, which is a characteristic that the little bittern shares. In contrast, the African fish eagle has short legs that are not suited for wading, as they are primarily used for walking and perching rather than moving through water.

Kirk has naturally dark skin."	['acquired', 'inherited']	1	Hint: Humans are born with their skin color.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Heredity	Identify inherited and acquired traits	"Organisms, including people, have both inherited and acquired traits. Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans do not choose their skin color. Babies get their skin color from their parents. So, Kirk's skin color is an inherited trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Kirk's naturally dark skin is an inherited trait because skin color is determined by genetic factors passed down from parents to their children. Unlike acquired traits, which develop due to environmental influences or personal choices, inherited traits are present at birth and are a direct result of one's genetic makeup. Since humans do not select their skin color, it clearly falls under the category of inherited traits."

"	The text argues that Professor Harrell's research is untrustworthy because someone else at her university was caught falsifying data. However, this isn't necessarily true. The practices of one researcher at a university do not necessarily reflect the practices of another researcher at the same university. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text exemplifies the guilt by association fallacy because it discredits Professor Harrell's findings based solely on the actions of another researcher at her university. This reasoning is flawed as it assumes that the misconduct of one individual reflects the integrity of others in the same institution. Such an assumption lacks evidence and unfairly tarnishes Professor Harrell's credibility without direct proof of her own practices.

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that while both samples have the same number of particles and the same average speed, the particles in sample B possess greater mass than those in sample A. Since kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and the square of velocity, this means that particles in sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy. Consequently, as temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, it follows that sample B has the higher temperature compared to sample A."

A slippery object is hard to hold onto or stand on. The honey and the tape are not slippery.
The property that all four objects have in common is sticky."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""sticky"" because all four objects share this property. The analysis shows that each object is capable of sticking to other surfaces, which confirms their stickiness. In contrast, the other properties of being slippery and sour do not apply to all four objects, as some are not slippery (honey and tape) and honey is not sour. Therefore, sticky is the only common property among all the objects."

	Based on this information, what is this Channel catfish's genotype for the body color gene?	['a white body', 'bb']	1	"In a group of Channel catfish, some individuals have a brown body and others have a white body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a brown body, and the allele b is for a white body.
A certain Channel catfish from this group has a white body. This catfish has two alleles for a white body."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. The Channel catfish has two alleles for a white body (b). So, the catfish's genotype for the body color gene is bb.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The Channel catfish in question has a white body, which is determined by the presence of the recessive allele b. Since it has two alleles for a white body, its genotype must be homozygous recessive, represented as bb. In the context of the choices provided, this corresponds to option (1), making the catfish's genotype for the body color gene bb. Thus, the answer is clearly supported by the information given about the inheritance of the body color trait in Channel catfish."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
a copper statue turning green
boiling sugar to make caramel"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	1		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But a copper statue turning green is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both changes are chemical changes. The transformation of a copper statue into a green color involves the formation of copper oxide through a reaction with oxygen, while boiling sugar leads to the creation of caramel, which is a different substance compared to the original sugar. Therefore, the commonality between these two changes lies in the fact that both result in the formation of new substances, indicating that they are indeed chemical changes."
	Which tennis ball has more thermal energy?	['the colder tennis ball', 'the hotter tennis ball']	1	Two tennis balls are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two tennis balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter tennis ball has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the greater the kinetic energy of the particles within that object. In this case, since both tennis balls are identical except for their temperatures, the hotter tennis ball will have particles that are moving more rapidly, resulting in higher thermal energy. Therefore, the hotter tennis ball has more thermal energy compared to the colder one."

Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus.

"	"A bald eagle's scientific name is Haliaeetus leucocephalus. The first word of its scientific name is Haliaeetus.
Strix varia is in the genus Strix. The first word of its scientific name is Strix. So, Strix varia and Haliaeetus leucocephalus are not in the same genus.
Falco tinnunculus is in the genus Falco. The first word of its scientific name is Falco. So, Falco tinnunculus and Haliaeetus leucocephalus are not in the same genus.
Haliaeetus pelagicus is in the genus Haliaeetus. The first word of its scientific name is Haliaeetus. So, Haliaeetus pelagicus and Haliaeetus leucocephalus are in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The bald eagle's scientific name is Haliaeetus leucocephalus, which indicates that it belongs to the genus Haliaeetus. Among the provided choices, Haliaeetus pelagicus is the only option that shares the same genus, as its scientific name also starts with Haliaeetus. In contrast, Strix varia and Falco tinnunculus belong to different genera (Strix and Falco, respectively), making them irrelevant to the question of which organism is in the same genus as the bald eagle. Therefore, Haliaeetus pelagicus is the correct choice."

The two blocks of iron have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 190°C block is hotter than the 180°C block, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The two blocks of iron are identical in mass but differ in temperature, with one at 180°C and the other at 190°C. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; as temperature increases, the thermal energy of an object also increases. Therefore, the block of iron at 190°C possesses more thermal energy than the one at 180°C, making it the correct choice."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.

Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both changes involve chemical transformations. The copper statue turning green is due to a reaction between copper and oxygen, forming copper oxide, which is a different substance. Similarly, polishing a tarnished silver spoon involves a chemical reaction that removes the tarnish, converting it back to its shiny state. Hence, both processes represent chemical changes rather than physical changes."

Therefore, the answer to the question is yes, as it aligns with the biological characteristics of animal cells."
	Which watermelon has a higher temperature?	['the watermelon with less thermal energy', 'the watermelon with more thermal energy']	1	Two watermelons are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two watermelons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the watermelon with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task involves understanding the relationship between thermal energy and temperature. Since both watermelons are identical in mass and material, the one with more thermal energy must have a higher temperature. This is because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, and more thermal energy indicates that the particles are moving more vigorously, resulting in a higher temperature. Therefore, the correct choice is the watermelon with more thermal energy."

['repel', 'attract']	0	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are oriented such that like poles are facing each other. In this case, if the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet, they will repel due to the fundamental magnetic principle that like poles repel. Therefore, the correct choice is to indicate that the magnets will repel."
	Compare the motion of three ducks. Which duck was moving at the highest speed?	['a duck that moved 565kilometers west in 10hours', 'a duck that moved 975kilometers south in 10hours', 'a duck that moved 860kilometers east in 10hours']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the fastest will go the farthest distance in that time. It is moving at the highest speed."	"Look at the distance each duck moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each duck moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each duck moved for 10 hours. The duck that moved 975 kilometers moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which duck was moving at the highest speed, we need to calculate the speed of each duck by using the formula speed = distance/time. All three ducks moved for the same duration of 10 hours. The duck that moved 975 kilometers south covered the greatest distance in that time, resulting in the highest speed compared to the other ducks. Thus, the duck moving 975 kilometers is the one that moved at the highest speed."
	Which announcement is more formal?	['The Oakdale Law Firm is so happy to tell you . . .', 'The Oakdale Law Firm is pleased to announce . . .']	1		closed choice	grade9	language science	writing-strategies	Audience, purpose, and tone	Which text is most formal?	"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The second announcement is more formal. It uses more elevated language (pleased to announce). The other announcement sounds more conversational (so happy).	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second announcement, ""The Oakdale Law Firm is pleased to announce,"" uses a more formal tone with phrases like ""pleased to announce,"" which conveys professionalism and respect. In contrast, the first announcement, ""The Oakdale Law Firm is so happy to tell you,"" adopts a more casual and conversational style that lacks the same level of formality. The choice of words and structure in the second option suggests a more serious intent, making it the more appropriate choice for formal communication."

Each purple ball represents one particle of solute.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Solutions	Compare concentrations of solutions	"A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the purple particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of purple particles."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: I chose Solution A as having a higher concentration of purple particles because the problem indicates that Solution A has more purple particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. The concentration of a solute is determined by the number of solute particles in relation to the volume of the solvent. Since the analysis clearly states that Solution A has a greater number of purple particles per milliliter, it logically follows that Solution A has the higher concentration of purple particles."
	Which gold bar has a higher temperature?	['the gold bar with more thermal energy', 'the gold bar with less thermal energy']	0	Two 6-kilogram gold bars are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.

The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two gold bars are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the gold bar with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The gold bar with more thermal energy will have a higher temperature because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Since both bars have the same mass and are made of the same material, the one with greater thermal energy indicates that its particles are moving more vigorously, resulting in a higher temperature. Therefore, the correct choice is the gold bar with more thermal energy."

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:
The crocodile egg fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the crocodile egg fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The crocodile egg fossil is located in a deeper layer of the sedimentary rock sequence, indicating that it was deposited earlier than the palm leaf fossil, which is found in a higher layer. In geology, the principle of superposition states that in undisturbed layers of rock, the oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest are at the top. Therefore, since the crocodile egg fossil is situated deeper than the palm leaf, it is more likely to be older."

The shape of an animal's mouth is one example of an adaptation. Animals' mouths can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large mouth with sharp teeth might help an animal tear through meat. A long, thin mouth might help an animal catch insects that live in holes. Animals that eat similar food often have similar mouths."	"Look at the picture of the leopard shark.
The leopard shark's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding. The leopard shark uses its mouth to find food hidden in the sediment of the ocean floor.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The sturgeon's mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward. Its mouth is adapted for bottom feeding.
The orangespine unicornfish's mouth is not located on the underside of its head. Its mouth is not adapted for bottom feeding."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the sturgeon because its mouth is located on the underside of its head and points downward, which is a characteristic adaptation for bottom feeding. This adaptation allows the sturgeon to effectively search for food buried in the sediment, similar to the leopard shark. In contrast, the orangespine unicornfish does not have this type of mouth orientation, making it unsuitable for bottom feeding. Thus, the sturgeon is the only animal in the choices that shares this specific adaptation."

SOLUTION: Slicing cheese is a physical change because it alters the shape and size of the cheese without changing its chemical composition. The properties of the cheese remain the same, as it is still cheese after being sliced. In contrast, a chemical change would involve a transformation that alters the substance at a molecular level, resulting in new substances. Therefore, since the original material is preserved, slicing cheese is classified as a physical change."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A sandwich rotting is a chemical change. The matter in the sandwich breaks down and slowly turns into a different type of matter.
A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.

Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Both changes involve transformations where the original substance is altered into a different type of matter, indicating they are both chemical changes. The rotting of the sandwich leads to decomposition and a breakdown of organic matter, while polishing the tarnished silver spoon results in a chemical reaction that removes the tarnish. Since both processes change the composition of the substances involved, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy because, although both samples have the same number of particles and average speed, the particles in sample B are more massive. The kinetic energy of a particle is directly proportional to its mass and the square of its speed, so with greater mass at the same speed, the average kinetic energy in sample B exceeds that of sample A. Consequently, since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles, sample B has the higher temperature."

	What is the volume of a small measuring spoon?	['5 milliliters', '5 liters']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a small measuring spoon is 5 milliliters.
5 liters is too much."	"ANSWER: 5 milliliters  
SOLUTION: A small measuring spoon is typically used for measuring small quantities of ingredients, commonly in cooking and baking. The standard volume for a small measuring spoon is usually around 5 milliliters, which is equivalent to 1 teaspoon. In contrast, 5 liters is a significantly larger volume, more suitable for large containers rather than a small spoon, making it an inappropriate choice for this context. Therefore, 5 milliliters is the better estimate for the volume of a small measuring spoon."

Silver bromide is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	1	Silver bromide is used on the film that some photographers use in their cameras. The chemical formula for silver bromide is AgBr.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms."	"You can tell whether silver bromide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for silver bromide, AgBr, contains two atomic symbols: Ag for silver and Br for bromine. So, the formula tells you that silver bromide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since silver bromide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, silver bromide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Silver bromide (AgBr) consists of two different atomic symbols: Ag for silver and Br for bromine. This indicates that it is formed from the combination of two elements, which is the defining characteristic of a compound. In contrast, an elementary substance would consist of only one type of element. Therefore, based on its chemical composition, silver bromide is classified as a compound."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The statement ""The magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2"" is true because the distance between the magnets in Pair 2 is greater than that in Pair 1. According to the principles of magnetism, the strength of the magnetic force decreases as the distance between the magnets increases. Since all magnets are made of the same material, the only factor affecting the strength of the magnetic force in this scenario is the distance separating the magnets.

Jeffrey will spend more time walking to the zebras. They are on the other side of the zoo, but the gibbons are close by."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The choice that indicates a cost for Jeffrey is that he will spend more time walking to the zebras because they are farther away, while the gibbons are closer. This decision implies that he is sacrificing time, which could have been used to see more animals before the zoo closes. In contrast, enjoying the zebras more than the gibbons does not represent a cost; rather, it signifies a benefit or value derived from the experience.

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the time Lola spends making the cream of mushroom soup represents an opportunity cost. By spending more time on this dish, she is giving up the opportunity to make the minestrone soup, which may take less time and potentially allow her to eat sooner. This highlights the trade-off she faces between the taste of the soup and the time it takes to prepare it, making the increased time a cost in her decision-making process."

Draco, a government official in seventh-century Athens, Greece, wrote a code of laws that called for severe punishments for even minor offenses.
The allusion draconian means harsh."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The term ""draconian"" originates from Draco, a legislator in ancient Athens known for his severe legal code. This historical reference highlights the harshness of the new recycling regulations Darnel is discussing. In this context, the allusion underscores the notion that the regulations are excessively strict, drawing a parallel to the infamous reputation of Draco's laws in Greek history.

Substances that are made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.

The chemical formula for zirconium is Zr. This formula contains one symbol: Zr. So, the formula tells you that zirconium is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zirconium is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Zirconium is represented by the chemical symbol Zr, which consists of only one symbol. This indicates that zirconium is composed of a single chemical element rather than being a compound made of multiple elements. Since substances that consist of only one chemical element are classified as elementary substances, zirconium falls into this category. Hence, the correct choice is that zirconium is an elementary substance."

The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cats."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with straight fur or curly fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for curly fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for straight fur.
Straight fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the dominant version of the fur type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur type gene. So, offspring with straight fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Curly fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur type trait. A cat with the recessive version of the fur type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur type gene. So, offspring with curly fur must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with straight fur to offspring with curly fur is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with straight fur. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with curly fur."	"ANSWER: 4:0  
SOLUTION: The problem describes a genetic cross involving two cats where the allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for curly fur (f). Since the offspring can only inherit the dominant allele F from both parents, all combinations (FF or Ff) will result in straight fur. The Punnett square analysis shows that there are no combinations that yield curly fur (ff), leading to an expected ratio of 4:0 for straight fur to curly fur. Thus, this cross will result in all offspring having straight fur."

It started raining. We ran inside.
You can also fix a run-on sentence by rewriting it as a compound sentence. A compound sentence is two sentences joined by a comma and a conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
I knocked on the door, and it opened.
It started raining, so we ran inside."	My family will swim at the town pool tomorrow is a complete sentence. The subject is my family, and the verb is will swim.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A complete sentence must contain a subject and a predicate and express a complete thought. In this case, ""My family will swim at the town pool tomorrow"" has a clear subject (""My family"") and a verb (""will swim""), making it a complete sentence. On the other hand, ""Aunt Christine's heavy baggage"" lacks a verb and does not express a complete thought, which is why it is not considered a complete sentence."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than those in Pair 1, which increases the magnitude of the magnetic force between them. Although the direction of the force (attraction or repulsion) differs between the pairs, it does not influence the force's magnitude. Given that the distance is smaller in Pair 2, the magnetic force is consequently greater compared to Pair 1. Thus, the correct answer is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The analysis of the magnets reveals that they have their north poles facing each other. According to the principles of magnetism, like poles (north-north or south-south) repel each other, while opposite poles (north-south) attract. Since both magnets are oriented with their north poles closest to one another, they will repel each other, leading to the conclusion that the answer is (1) repel."

SOLUTION: The statement claims that 75% of the planets in our solar system are made mainly of rock. However, there are eight planets in total, and only four of them (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are classified as terrestrial, or rocky. This means that only 50% of the planets are primarily composed of rock, which is significantly lower than the 75% stated in the question. Therefore, the statement is false."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: In this scenario, both samples have the same number of gas particles and the same average speed. However, the key factor is that the particles in sample B have a greater mass than those in sample A. Kinetic energy is calculated using the formula KE = 0.5 * m * v², where m is mass and v is velocity. Since the particles in sample B, having more mass, will have a higher average kinetic energy despite the same speed, this results in sample B having a higher temperature. Therefore, the correct answer is that sample B has the higher temperature."

The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.

SOLUTION: The task requires estimating the time it takes to perform ten jumping jacks, which is a quick physical activity. Typically, a person can complete ten jumping jacks in a matter of seconds, making 17 seconds a reasonable estimate. In contrast, 17 hours is excessively long for such a short exercise, as it would mean performing the jumping jacks at an incredibly slow pace. Therefore, 17 seconds is clearly the better choice."

The word soft describes how this feather feels to the touch.
Heavy and bumpy can also describe how something feels to the touch. But they do not describe this feather."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The word ""soft"" is the most appropriate choice to describe how a feather feels to the touch. Feathers are generally known for their light and delicate texture, which aligns perfectly with the description of being soft. On the other hand, ""heavy"" and ""bumpy"" do not accurately capture the common tactile sensation associated with feathers, as they typically lack weight and roughness. Therefore, ""soft"" is the best descriptor in this context."

"Each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. The particles in sample B also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: I chose answer 2 because the explanation indicates that the particles in sample B not only have greater mass but also exhibit a higher average speed compared to the particles in sample A. Since kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and the square of speed, the combination of these factors results in a higher average kinetic energy for the particles in sample B. Consequently, since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles in a sample, sample B must have the higher temperature."

Haley will give up the chance to watch a movie with her sister."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because a cost is defined as what is sacrificed when making a decision. In this scenario, if Haley decides to watch the comedy, she will miss the opportunity to spend time with her sister by watching a movie together, which is something she values. Although she prefers the comedy, the trade-off of not being with her sister represents a significant cost in terms of their relationship and shared experience."
	Which bowl of oatmeal has a higher temperature?	['the bowl of oatmeal with less thermal energy', 'the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy']	1	Two bowls of oatmeal are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two bowls of oatmeal are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the bowl of oatmeal with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task presents two bowls of oatmeal that differ only in their thermal energy. According to the principles of thermodynamics, temperature is directly related to the thermal energy contained within a substance. Therefore, the bowl of oatmeal that possesses more thermal energy will necessarily have a higher temperature compared to the one with less thermal energy. This conclusion is consistent with the fundamental understanding of heat and temperature in physics."

['physical change', 'chemical change']	0		closed choice	grade5	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	"Ice melting in a cup is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The solid ice becomes liquid, but it is still made of water.
The links between atoms in the water molecules do not change. So, a different type of matter is not formed."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Ice melting in a cup is a physical change because it involves a change of state from solid to liquid without altering the chemical composition of the water. The molecules remain water (H2O) throughout the process; they simply transition from a solid arrangement to a more fluid state. Since the substance remains the same and no new substances are formed, this confirms that it is a physical change rather than a chemical change."
	"What kind of sentence is this?
How many articles did Dave write before his publisher offered him a book contract?"	['interrogative', 'exclamatory', 'declarative']	0		closed choice	grade6	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement, and it always ends with a period.
The nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.
An interrogative sentence is a question, and it always ends with a question mark.
Do you have any plans for the upcoming weekend?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something, and it usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.
For this assignment, use references to support your claims.
Don't drive so quickly in the construction zone!
An exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.
I can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!"	The sentence asks something, and it ends with a question mark. It is an interrogative sentence.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence is classified as interrogative because it poses a question and seeks information about the number of articles Dave wrote. It is structured to elicit a response, indicated by the use of a question mark at the end. The other options, exclamatory and declarative, do not apply as the sentence does not express strong emotion or make a statement. Therefore, the correct choice is (0) interrogative."
	How long is a garden snail?	['2 yards', '2 inches']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of a garden snail is 2 inches.
2 yards is too long."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: A garden snail typically measures around 2 to 4 inches in length, making 2 inches a more accurate estimate than 2 yards. The choice of 2 yards is excessively long, as it would be more than 6 feet, which is not realistic for the size of a common garden snail. Therefore, 2 inches is the correct and reasonable selection based on the average size of garden snails."

A julia butterfly is an insect. Like other insects, a julia butterfly does not have a backbone. It has a hard outer cover."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the julia butterfly (0) because it is classified as an insect, which, according to the hint, does not have a backbone. Insects, along with spiders and worms, are part of the invertebrate group that lacks a spinal column. In contrast, the sea eagle (1) is a bird and, like all birds, possesses a backbone, making it a vertebrate. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is the julia butterfly."

['8 miles', '8 yards', '8 inches', '8 feet']	3	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of distance, mass, and volume	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.
A football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long."	"The best estimate for the length of a sofa is 8 feet.
8 inches is too short. 8 yards and 8 miles are too long."	"ANSWER: 8 feet  
SOLUTION: I chose 8 feet as the best estimate for the length of a sofa because it is a common measurement for standard sofas, which typically range from about 6 to 8 feet in length. The option of 8 inches is significantly too short for a sofa, while 8 yards (24 feet) and 8 miles are excessively long and unrealistic for furniture dimensions. Therefore, 8 feet is the most reasonable and accurate choice among the options provided."

['a gas', 'a solid', 'a liquid']	2		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	States of matter	Classify matter as solid, liquid, or gas	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a shape of its own.
Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.
Think about pouring a liquid from a cup into a bottle. The shape of the liquid is different in the cup than in the bottle. But the liquid still takes up the same amount of space.
Juice is a liquid. Honey is also a liquid.
When matter is a gas, it spreads out to fill a space.
Many gases are invisible. So, you can’t see them. Air is a gas."	"Rain is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you put rainwater into a bucket, the rainwater will take the shape of the bucket. But the rainwater will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Rain is classified as a liquid because it consists of water droplets that fall from the atmosphere. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container, which is demonstrated when rainwater collects in different types of receptacles. The behavior of rainwater, such as flowing and conforming to the shape of surfaces, is characteristic of liquids, confirming its classification as such."
	Compare the motion of two bats. Which bat was moving at a lower speed?

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each bat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One bat moved 35 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other bat moved 45 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each bat spent the same amount of time moving. The bat that moved 35 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that bat must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the bat that moved 35 kilometers in 5 hours covered a shorter distance compared to the bat that moved 45 kilometers in the same amount of time. Since both bats took the same time to move, the speed can be determined by the distance traveled. Consequently, the bat moving 35 kilometers must have been moving at a lower speed than the bat moving 45 kilometers."

The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily because we have a concert in two weeks.
A run-on sentence is formed when two sentences are run together, joined by just a comma or by no punctuation at all. If only a comma is used, the run-on is called a comma splice.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, we have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily we have a concert in two weeks.
There are several ways to fix a run-on sentence:
Use stronger punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily. We have a concert in two weeks.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily; we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a comma and a coordinating conjunction to create a compound sentence. Coordinating conjunctions include and, but, or, and so.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily, and we have a concert in two weeks.
Use a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun to create a complex sentence. Subordinating conjunctions include after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, and while. Relative pronouns include that, which, who, whom, and whose.
The band I'm in has been rehearsing daily since we have a concert in two weeks."	"This is not a run-on sentence. It is not formed from two sentences that have been run together without appropriate punctuation.
Located just south of Dover, Tristan's Restaurant offers an eclectic menu in a scenic country setting."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: This sentence is not a run-on because it consists of a single independent clause that is properly punctuated. The introductory phrase ""Located just south of Dover"" provides additional context but does not create a separate clause, and the main clause ""Tristan's Restaurant offers an eclectic menu in a scenic country setting"" stands alone with proper structure. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a complete sentence and is grammatically correct without being a run-on."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 2 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The strength of the magnetic force between two magnets decreases with distance. In this scenario, the magnets in Pair 2 are positioned farther apart compared to those in Pair 1. Therefore, the magnetic force in Pair 2 is weaker due to the increased distance between the magnets, validating the choice that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2."

It has many elements that make it different from ordinary writing. Knowing these elements can help you talk about poetry, understand it better, and enjoy it more.
A poem rhymes when it has a pattern of words that end in the same sound.
End rhyme is when the rhymes appear at the end of a poem's lines.
Little Betty Blue,
Lost her holiday shoe.
—From Mother Goose
Internal rhyme is when at least one of the rhyming words appears inside the poem's lines.
Sweet dreams of pleasant streams.
—From William Blake, ""A Cradle Song""
Rhythm is the pattern of strong and weak syllables, or stress, in a poem. You can recognize rhythm in a poem by listening to how it sounds. Poems with regular rhythm have a beat, like in music.
He watches from his mountain walls,
And like a thunderbolt he falls.
—From Alfred, Lord Tennyson, ""The Eagle""
The syllables in bold are strong. We say them with more force than the other syllables. In this poem, every weak syllable is followed by a strong syllable. Each line sounds like da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM. To better hear the rhythm, try reading it aloud while clapping on each strong syllable.
Free verse is when a poem has neither a regular rhythm nor a rhyme pattern.
The old bridge has a wrinkled face.
He bends his back
For us to go over.
—From Hilda Conkling, ""The Old Bridge""
The syllables in bold are strong. You can see this poem does not have a regular rhythm. It also doesn't have a rhyme pattern.
Repetition is when words, phrases, or whole lines are repeated.

Onomatopoeia is when language sounds like what it talks about.
Sometimes the onomatopoeia uses made-up words:
Tlot-tlot! tlot-tlot! Had they heard it? The horse hoofs ringing clear.

SOLUTION: I chose option (0) because it exemplifies a regular rhythmic pattern that follows a clear da-DUM da-DUM beat, characteristic of iambic meter. The strong syllables in the lines create a consistent rhythm that emphasizes the imagery of the modest violet. In contrast, option (1) lacks this rhythmic regularity, making it less fitting for the description provided.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The explanation provided indicates that the size of the magnets influences the magnitude of the magnetic force. In Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than Magnet B in Pair 2. Since Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, the smaller size of Magnet B in Pair 1 results in a smaller magnetic force compared to Pair 2. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1."

The allele I is for a spotted tail, and the allele i is for an unspotted tail.
Undyne, a guppy from this group, has a spotted tail. Undyne has two alleles for a spotted tail."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Undyne's observable version of the tail spots trait is a spotted tail. So, Undyne's phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Undyne exhibits the trait for a spotted tail, which corresponds to the phenotype described in the choices. Since the question specifies that Undyne has a spotted tail and the allele for a spotted tail is denoted by I, it is evident that the phenotype for the tail spots trait is a spotted tail. Therefore, the correct choice that represents Undyne's phenotype is (0) a spotted tail."

SOLUTION: The baby's hand applies a force toward itself, which causes the cabinet door to move in the same direction and open. This action is classified as a pull because the force is directed towards the baby, rather than away from it.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose Solution A because it contains a higher number of yellow particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. To determine concentration, we consider both the number of yellow particles and the volume of solvent. Since Solution A has more yellow particles in the same volume, it results in a higher concentration of the yellow solute. Thus, Solution A is the correct choice for having a higher concentration of yellow particles."

This discrepancy between the literal meaning of his words and the implied meaning highlights the use of irony. Shane's remark suggests a level of sarcasm, as the hairstyle is anything but boring, further reinforcing the idea that he is not genuinely expressing his opinion but rather making a playful or mocking statement."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using customary units, length may be written with units of inches, feet, yards, or miles.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot, and 3 feet in 1 yard. There are 5,280 feet in 1 mile.
A football is about 1 foot long. A football field is 100 yards long."	"The best estimate for the length of a tennis court is 75 feet.
75 inches is too short. 75 yards and 75 miles are too long."	"ANSWER: 75 feet  
SOLUTION: A standard tennis court measures 78 feet in length, which closely aligns with the choice of 75 feet. The other options, such as 75 yards (which is significantly longer at 225 feet) and 75 miles (which is excessively long), are not realistic for the dimensions of a tennis court. Additionally, 75 inches (6.25 feet) is too short to represent the length of a tennis court. Therefore, 75 feet is the best estimate among the provided options."

The idiom see eye to eye suggests that Mr. and Mrs. Gregory usually agree. When you see eye to eye with someone, you share their opinion."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The idiom ""see eye to eye"" implies that two parties have the same opinion or perspective on a subject. In the context of the text, it indicates that Mr. and Mrs. Gregory generally agree with each other on various matters. However, the mention of the controversial mayoral race suggests that they do not share the same views on this particular issue, which highlights their disagreement in this specific instance while still affirming their usual agreement."

['Sarracenia purpurea', 'Lynx pardinus', 'Ardea cocoi']	2	This organism is a purple heron. Its scientific name is Ardea purpurea.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A purple heron's scientific name is Ardea purpurea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea.
Sarracenia purpurea and Ardea purpurea are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Sarracenia purpurea and Ardea purpurea have the same species name within their genus, purpurea. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Sarracenia purpurea is in the genus Sarracenia, and Ardea purpurea is in the genus Ardea.
Ardea cocoi is in the genus Ardea. The first word of its scientific name is Ardea. So, Ardea cocoi and Ardea purpurea are in the same genus.
Lynx pardinus is in the genus Lynx. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx. So, Lynx pardinus and Ardea purpurea are not in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose Ardea cocoi as the answer because it shares the same genus, Ardea, with the purple heron, which has the scientific name Ardea purpurea. The genus name is the first part of the scientific name, and since both Ardea purpurea and Ardea cocoi begin with ""Ardea,"" they belong to the same genus. In contrast, Sarracenia purpurea and Lynx pardinus are in different genera (Sarracenia and Lynx, respectively), making them not relevant to the question. Thus, the only correct choice is Ardea cocoi."
	Which of the following contains a vague pronoun reference?

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. The text has been rewritten so that the meaning is clear.
Susan has pierced ears, but otherwise she looks almost identical to her twin sister Kate."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference because the pronoun ""she"" could ambiguously refer to either Susan or her twin sister Kate. This lack of clarity can lead to confusion about who has pierced ears. In contrast, the first answer choice eliminates this ambiguity by clearly stating that ""Susan has pierced ears,"" leaving no doubt about who is being referred to. This makes the first statement clearer and more precise in its meaning."

Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
"	"The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses overly simple or imprecise language (some things, bring up).
The first sentence uses more precise language, so it is more formal overall."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first sentence, ""Ms. Malone has several important proposals to discuss at the next city council meeting,"" is more formal due to its precise language and structured tone. It uses the term ""important proposals,"" which conveys a sense of seriousness and professionalism, and the phrase ""to discuss"" is more formal than ""bring up."" In contrast, the second sentence employs informal phrases like ""some things"" and ""bring up,"" which lack specificity and make the overall tone more casual. Thus, the first sentence is clearly the more formal option."

The simile like the parched earth during a drought suggests that Whitney's hands were dry and cracked. A drought is a period without rain; the ground during a drought can become hard and cracked."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The simile compares Whitney's hands to ""the parched earth during a drought,"" which strongly indicates that her hands are lacking moisture and are likely dry and cracked, similar to how the earth appears when it has not received rain for an extended period. The phrase ""parched earth"" specifically evokes images of dryness and desolation, reinforcing the idea that Whitney's hands are in a similar state of neglect. Therefore, option (1) accurately reflects the condition of her hands as described by the simile."

Benedict Arnold alludes to the American general during the Revolutionary War who betrayed his country and fought for the British."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text employs an allusion by referencing Benedict Arnold, a historical figure known for his betrayal during the American Revolutionary War. This allusion effectively conveys the idea of betrayal in Caleb's actions without needing to explain the entire context, as most readers will recognize the significance of the reference. In contrast, a simile would involve a direct comparison using ""like"" or ""as,"" which is not present in the text. Thus, the use of a well-known name to signify disloyalty points to an allusion rather than a simile."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.

6 ounces is too light and 6 tons is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 6

SOLUTION: The choice of 6 pounds as the best estimate for the mass of a full bag of groceries is based on common knowledge and experience with typical grocery items. A standard bag of groceries usually contains various products, such as fruits, vegetables, and packaged goods, which collectively weigh around 5 to 10 pounds. The options of 6 ounces are too light, as that would only account for a few small items, while 6 tons is excessively heavy and unrealistic for a single bag. Therefore, 6 pounds is the most reasonable estimate."

A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The black bear has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree. The persimmon tree is a producer, so the black bear is a primary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is a producer, so the beaver is a primary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a primary consumer.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not a primary consumer.
The gray fox has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the pine vole. Neither the swallowtail caterpillar nor the pine vole is a producer, so the gray fox is not a primary consumer."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: In the food web described, the primary consumers are the organisms that feed directly on producers. The persimmon tree and the silver maple are both producers, and they have arrows pointing to the black bear and the beaver, respectively. Since the beaver is indicated to have an arrow pointing from the silver maple, it confirms that the beaver is a primary consumer. Thus, the correct answer is (2) beaver, as it directly consumes the producer silver maple."

Camille and her mom sat on the back porch and watched as the sun sank into the horizon."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second sentence, ""Open and honest communication is the foundation of a healthy relationship,"" is indeed a complex sentence as it contains an independent clause but does not include a dependent clause. However, the first sentence, ""Camille and her mom sat on the back porch and watched as the sun sank into the horizon,"" is a compound sentence because it has two independent clauses connected by 'and' but does not contain a dependent clause. The complexity in sentences is determined by the presence of dependent clauses, which is absent in both options. Thus, the initial assessment of the second choice being a complex sentence is incorrect."

SOLUTION: I chose option 0, the pelican, because it meets the criteria for being a bird as outlined in the hint: it has feathers, two wings, and a beak. The text also provides additional information about brown pelicans, emphasizing their behavior and habitat, which further supports their classification as birds. In contrast, the golden frog, listed as option 1, is an amphibian and does not possess the characteristics of a bird, such as feathers or wings. Therefore, the only correct choice is the pelican."

Solution A has more yellow particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of yellow particles."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose Solution A because it has more yellow particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. By using the concentration formula, which measures the number of solute particles in relation to the volume of solvent, it becomes evident that Solution A demonstrates a greater density of yellow particles. This directly indicates a higher concentration of yellow particles in Solution A compared to Solution B."

During the nineteenth century, the U.S. Army used camels as pack animals in the Southwest. Though the program was discontinued after the outbreak of the Civil War, reported sightings of random camels throughout the Southwest continued through at least the 1940 s.
Most style guides recommend to avoid using the nontraditional sense of the word random because it is generally considered incorrect."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose option 0 because it uses the word ""random"" in its traditional sense, referring to occurrences that lack a definite pattern, as seen in the phrase ""reported sightings of random camels."" This aligns with the conventional meaning of the word.

A cherry tree is a living thing.
Cherry trees grow and change. They need food and water.
Cherry trees are plants. They make their own food using water, air, and energy from sunlight."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the cherry tree as the living thing because it exhibits all the characteristics of life, such as growth, reproduction, and the need for nutrients and water. Unlike the stop sign, which is an inanimate object and does not possess any biological functions, the cherry tree is a plant that can photosynthesize, making its own food using sunlight, air, and water.

Scientific names are written in italics, but common names are usually not. The first word of the scientific name is capitalized, and the second word is not. For example, the common name of the animal below is giant panda. Its scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca."	"Haliaeetus leucocephalus is written in italics. The first word is capitalized, and the second word is not. So, it is the scientific name.
Haliaeetus leucocephalus is the organism's scientific name. So, you know that bald eagle is the common name."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question asks for the common name of the organism identified in the text. The provided hint states that the organism is a bald eagle, which directly corresponds to choice (0). On the other hand, choice (1) represents the scientific name, Haliaeetus leucocephalus, which is not what the question is asking for. Therefore, the correct answer is (0) bald eagle."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
silver jewelry tarnishing
boiling sugar to make caramel"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Metal turning less shiny over time is called tarnishing. Silver jewelry tarnishing is a chemical change. The silver reacts with sulfur in the air to form black tarnish. The tarnish is a different type of matter that was not there before the change.
Boiling sugar to make caramel is a chemical change. The heat causes the sugar to change into a different type of matter. Unlike sugar, the new matter is brown and sticky.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Boiling sugar is caused by heating. But silver tarnishing is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: Both changes—silver jewelry tarnishing and boiling sugar to make caramel—are chemical changes. In tarnishing, silver reacts with sulfur in the air, forming a different substance that alters the appearance of the jewelry. Similarly, boiling sugar causes it to undergo a transformation into caramel, which is a distinct substance. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are chemical changes."

Then compare the result to the volume of Uranus. The volume of Uranus is 68,300 billion km^3, which is less than 82,713 billion km^3. So, the volume of Uranus is less than one-tenth the volume of Saturn."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The statement is true because the volume of Uranus is 68,300 billion km³, while one-tenth of the volume of Saturn, which is approximately 827,130 billion km³, is 82,713 billion km³. When comparing these two values, 68,300 billion km³ (the volume of Uranus) is indeed less than 82,713 billion km³. Therefore, the statement that the volume of Uranus is less than one-tenth of the volume of Saturn is accurate."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals.
Appeals to ethos, or character, show the writer or speaker as trustworthy, authoritative, or sharing important values with the audience. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
include an endorsement from a respected organization, such as the American Dental Association
feature a testimonial from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
use an admired celebrity or athlete as a spokesperson
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and verifiable evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
cite results of clinical trials or independently conducted studies
explain the science behind a product or service
emphasize that the product is a financially wise choice
anticipate and refute potential counterclaims
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury"	The ad appeals to logos, or reason, by citing evidence that proves the vacuum's effectiveness.	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The ad primarily appeals to logos, as it presents factual evidence and logical reasoning to demonstrate the vacuum's effectiveness. By citing specific data or statistics, it aims to persuade the audience through rational argumentation rather than emotional appeal or character credibility. This approach focuses on the practical benefits and efficiency of the product, making it a logical choice for consumers looking for a reliable vacuum."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question asks about the magnetic force between two pairs of magnets. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than those in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 is stronger. This is based on the principle that distance affects magnetic force; closer magnets exhibit a stronger force. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to the temperature of the gas. Since the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than those in sample B and all particles have the same mass, it follows that the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is greater. Consequently, because temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, sample A must be at a higher temperature than sample B."

	Which cherry pie has a higher temperature?	['the cherry pie with more thermal energy', 'the cherry pie with less thermal energy']	0	Two cherry pies are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two cherry pies are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cherry pie with more thermal energy has a higher temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The task presents a comparison between two identical cherry pies that differ only in their thermal energy levels. Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, the cherry pie with more thermal energy will have particles moving more vigorously, resulting in a higher temperature. Therefore, the cherry pie with more thermal energy is clearly the one with the higher temperature."

	"What do these two changes have in common?
butter melting on a hot day
peeling a banana"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.']	0		closed choice	grade3	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Butter melting on a hot day is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. The butter changes from solid to liquid, but it is still made of the same type of matter.
Peeling a banana is a physical change. The peel is not covering the rest of the fruit anymore. But both the peel and the banana are still made of the same type of matter as before.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Butter melting on a hot day is caused by heating. But peeling a banana is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Both changes involve physical transformations rather than chemical reactions. Butter melting is a change of state from solid to liquid due to heat, and peeling a banana involves the physical removal of the peel without altering the banana's chemical composition. Since neither change results in new substances being formed, they are categorized as physical changes. Therefore, the correct answer is that both are only physical changes."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The size of the magnets directly influences the strength of the magnetic force between them. In this scenario, Magnet A is the same size in both pairs, but Magnet B in Pair 2 is larger than Magnet B in Pair 1. Since larger magnets generally produce a stronger magnetic force, the greater size of Magnet B in Pair 2 results in a stronger magnetic force compared to Pair 1. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2."
	Based on this information, what is Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene?	['a spotted coat', 'Aa']	1	"In a group of leopards, some individuals have a spotted coat and others have a black coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele A is for a spotted coat, and the allele a is for a black coat.
Apollo, a leopard from this group, has a spotted coat. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat and one allele for a black coat."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Apollo has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one allele for a black coat (a). So, Apollo's genotype for the coat pattern gene is Aa.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Apollo has a spotted coat, which indicates that he possesses at least one allele for the spotted coat trait (A). Since it is stated that he has one allele for a spotted coat (A) and one for a black coat (a), his genotype must be Aa. This combination of alleles, Aa, reflects his phenotype of a spotted coat while also including the recessive allele for the black coat. Thus, the correct answer is 1, representing the genotype Aa."

It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the word awoke. It describes the smoke detector as if it were a person who is waking up.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""awoke"" because it personifies the smoke detector by attributing a human action—waking up—to it. This gives the impression that the smoke detector has a consciousness and the ability to become alert, similar to a person who has been sleeping for a long time. In contrast, ""went off"" simply describes the action of the smoke detector activating without any human-like qualities, making it less suitable for personification. The word ""awoke"" enhances the imagery and emotional impact of the sentence."

SOLUTION: A simple sentence consists of a single independent clause, which contains a subject and a predicate. In this case, the first choice, ""The package includes some old letters from my grandma to my dad and a broken pocket watch,"" is a simple sentence because it has one subject (""The package"") and one predicate (""includes some old letters and a broken pocket watch""). The second choice, ""Unless the weather forecast is wrong, you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow,"" is a complex sentence as it contains a dependent clause (""Unless the weather forecast is wrong"") and an independent clause (""you'll probably need an umbrella tomorrow"")."

Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram."	"The better estimate for the mass of a goat is 33 kilograms.
33 grams is too light."	"ANSWER: 33 kilograms  
SOLUTION: The mass of an adult goat typically ranges from about 45 to 300 pounds, which translates to approximately 20 to 136 kilograms. Given this information, 33 grams is significantly underestimated and would not be a realistic mass for a goat. Therefore, 33 kilograms is the better estimate, as it is within the expected weight range for goats."

Both are caused by heating.
Both changes are caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Both baking an apple pie and cooking an egg involve heating, which causes chemical changes in the food. In each case, the original ingredients undergo transformations that alter their chemical composition, resulting in a different matter than what was initially present. Therefore, the common factor between the two changes is that they are both caused by heating, leading to the conclusion that choice (1) is the correct answer."

SOLUTION: The analysis of the magnet sizes indicates that in Pair 1, Magnet B is smaller than Magnet B in Pair 2. Since all magnets are of the same material, the larger size of Magnet B in Pair 2 leads to a greater magnetic force when interacting with Magnet A, which remains the same size in both pairs. Therefore, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1, making statement (0) the correct choice."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 80°F bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 70°F bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The task asks to compare the thermal energy of two identical bowls of oatmeal at different temperatures. Since thermal energy is directly related to temperature, the bowl of oatmeal at 80°F possesses more thermal energy than the one at 70°F. This is because thermal energy increases with an increase in temperature, assuming other factors like mass remain constant. Therefore, the bowl at 80°F is the correct choice as it has more thermal energy."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a paintbrush is 26 centimeters.
26 millimeters is too short. 26 meters and 26 kilometers are too long."	"ANSWER: 26 centimeters  
SOLUTION: A typical paintbrush is generally around 20 to 30 centimeters in length, making 26 centimeters a reasonable estimate. The option of 26 millimeters is too short for a standard paintbrush, while 26 meters and 26 kilometers are excessively long and unrealistic for this type of tool.

['Solution B', 'Solution A', 'neither; their concentrations are the same']	1	The diagram below is a model of two solutions. Each green ball represents one particle of solute.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Solutions	Compare concentrations of solutions	"A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the green particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of green particles, look at both the number of green particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of green particles per milliliter.
Solution A has more green particles per milliliter. So, Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The analysis of the number of green particles and the volume of solvent in Solution A and Solution B reveals that Solution A contains a greater number of green particles per milliliter compared to Solution B. By applying the concentration formula, which calculates the concentration as the number of solute particles divided by the volume of solvent, it becomes evident that Solution A has a higher ratio. Therefore, I conclude that Solution A has a higher concentration of green particles."

In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for green body feathers (B) is dominant over the allele for blue body feathers (b).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two budgerigar parakeets."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Use Punnett squares to calculate ratios of offspring types	"Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?
How do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
If an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.
If an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.
A Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.
For example, consider the Punnett square below.
 | F | f
F | FF | Ff
f | Ff | ff
There is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.
"	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with blue body feathers or green body feathers, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. The question tells you that the B allele, which is for green body feathers, is dominant over the b allele, which is for blue body feathers.
Blue body feathers is the recessive allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the recessive version of the body feather color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with blue body feathers must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
Green body feathers is the dominant allele's version of the body feather color trait. A budgerigar parakeet with the dominant version of the body feather color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body feather color gene. So, offspring with green body feathers must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to offspring with green body feathers is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with blue body feathers. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green body feathers."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The expected ratio of offspring with blue body feathers to those with green body feathers is 0:4, indicating that no offspring would have blue feathers and all would have green. This conclusion is drawn from the genetic information provided: since the allele for green (B) is dominant over the allele for blue (b), any combination of alleles (BB or Bb) results in green body feathers. Therefore, no boxes in the Punnett square correspond to the genotype bb, confirming that all offspring will exhibit the dominant phenotype."

['the Arctic Ocean', 'the Pacific Ocean', 'the Indian Ocean']	0		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

SOLUTION: The prime meridian, which is established at 0° longitude, runs from the North Pole to the South Pole. It intersects the Arctic Ocean as it passes through northern regions. The meridian does not intersect the Pacific Ocean or the Indian Ocean, which are located further west and south, respectively.

The bottlenose dolphin has flippers. Its limbs are adapted for swimming.
The nilgai has long legs. Its limbs are not adapted for swimming. The nilgai uses its limbs to walk and run on land."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the bottlenose dolphin because its limbs, which are modified into flippers, are specifically adapted for swimming. In contrast, the nilgai has long legs that are designed for walking and running on land, making it unsuitable for swimming. The text clearly states that the northern elephant seal uses its flippers to navigate through water, indicating that adaptations for swimming are present in both the dolphin and the seal, but not in the nilgai."

In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a normal-sized body, and the allele b is for a dwarf body.
Algernon, a rat from this group, has a dwarf body. Algernon has two alleles for a dwarf body."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Algernon has two alleles for a dwarf body (b). So, Algernon's genotype for the body size gene is bb.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Algernon's genotype for the body size gene is determined by the two alleles he possesses. Since he has a dwarf body, which is associated with the recessive allele (b), and it is stated that he has two alleles for a dwarf body, his genotype must be bb. Therefore, the correct answer is (0) bb, as it accurately reflects his genetic makeup for the body size trait."

say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:

In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

Solid bronze forms when the mixture cools. The copper and tin are now combined as bronze. But they are still made of the same types of matter as before."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Mixing copper and tin to create bronze is classified as a physical change because it involves melting the metals and combining them without altering their fundamental chemical structures. The process allows for the metals to maintain their individual properties even after they are mixed. When the mixture cools, it solidifies into bronze, but the original elements (copper and tin) remain unchanged in their chemical identities.

Earth's gravity is pulling down on Cassie with a force of 600N. The seat of the cart is pushing up on Cassie with a force of 1,200N.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Balanced and unbalanced forces	"A force is a push or a pull that acts on an object. Every force has a direction and a magnitude, or strength. If two forces act on an object in opposite directions, the forces are called opposing forces.
When opposing forces have the same magnitude, they are balanced. If all the forces on an object are balanced, there is no net force on the object.
When opposing forces have different magnitudes, the forces are unbalanced. If any forces on an object are unbalanced, there is a net force on the object."	"To determine if there is a net force on Cassie, look at the forces:
Earth's gravity is pulling Cassie down with a force of 600 N.
The seat of the cart is pushing Cassie up with a force of 1,200 N.
The forces are in opposite directions, and the forces have different magnitudes: 600 N and 1,200 N. This means that the forces are unbalanced, so there is a net force on Cassie."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The forces acting on Cassie are not balanced because the upward force from the seat of the cart (1,200 N) is greater than the downward gravitational force (600 N). This difference results in a net force acting on Cassie in the upward direction. Since the forces do not cancel each other out, it confirms that there is a net force on Cassie, making the correct statement that the forces are unbalanced."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=302x202 at 0x312D53D10>	Based on clues in the text, how did fossil evidence help scientists explain the huge number of beetle species?	"[""It helped scientists learn that beetle species only appeared after Earth's most recent ice age."", 'It helped scientists figure out which ancient animal species were most likely to eat beetles.', ""It let scientists compare ancient beetles' wing structure to modern beetles' wing structure."", 'It let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct species.']"	3	"Read the text about beetles.
There are more species of beetles than any other life-form on Earth. About 380,000 species of beetles are known to exist, and more are discovered all the time. There are several theories about why there are so many different beetles, but fossils give us one clue. Using fossils, scientists can see how many ancient species used to exist but are now extinct. They found that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal ever. This means that beetle species don't die out as often as other animals. Beetles seem to have an edge over other creatures.
One of the reasons beetles thrive is their body design. Most beetle species have two pairs of wings. The front pair is hard and thick like a helmet. These wings protect the rear set of wings and the beetle's abdomen. The front wings are not used for flying. Instead, the wings shield the beetle's veins and other soft parts from harm.
Beetle species live all over the world and have many different types of food available to them. Most beetles are omnivores. That means they eat both plants and animals. Their flexible diets help them adapt to different habitats, even when a certain food source becomes scarce. Beetles can find something to eat, no matter what.
Finally, beetles can move quickly over long distances. If there are any harmful changes to their environment, they can usually find a better place to live. For example, many animal species have died out during ice ages, when Earth's temperature has dropped for a long time. But many beetles survived this dangerous time. Beetles quickly notice temperature changes in their environment. So, they can quickly respond by migrating to a warmer place. No wonder there are so many beetles in the world. They have what it takes to stay alive."	closed choice	grade5	language science	reading-comprehension	Informational texts: level 1	Read passages about animals	Informational texts include many facts, examples, and details. Authors don't always directly state how these things connect to each other. So, you may need to make guesses, or inferences, to understand how the ideas from the text fit together. Inferences can help you understand the whole text and draw conclusions about the information. Be sure to base your inferences on details found in the text as well as things you already know.	"Think about these details from the text:
Fossils can show how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Fossil evidence shows that beetles die out less often than any other animal.
Beetles' low extinction rate helps explain the large number of beetle species.
In order to show that beetles die out less often than other animals, scientists must have compared different animals' extinction rates. To do this, they would need to figure out how many ancient species have gone extinct.
Based on these clues, you can guess that fossil evidence let scientists compare the number of extinct beetles to the number of other extinct animals. This helped them figure out that beetles die out less often than other animals, which explains the huge number of beetle species."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: I chose option (3) because the text emphasizes that fossil evidence allows scientists to see how many ancient species, including beetles, have gone extinct. It specifically mentions that beetles have the lowest extinction rates of any animal, which implies that scientists compared the extinction rates of beetles with those of other species. This comparison of extinct beetles to other extinct animals helps explain the abundance of beetle species today."

A food web models how the matter eaten by organisms moves through an ecosystem. The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Ecological interactions	Interpret food webs I	"A food web is a model.
A food web shows where organisms in an ecosystem get their food. Models can make things in nature easier to understand because models can represent complex things in a simpler way. If a food web showed every organism in an ecosystem, the food web would be hard to understand. So, each food web shows how some organisms in an ecosystem can get their food.
Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Tertiary consumers eat secondary consumers. So, in a food web, tertiary consumers have arrows pointing to them from secondary consumers. Secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. And primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a secondary consumer, so the beaver is not a tertiary consumer.
The gray fox has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole. The pine vole is a secondary consumer, so the gray fox is a tertiary consumer.
The black racer has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole. The pine vole is a secondary consumer, so the black racer is a tertiary consumer.
The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the persimmon tree, the swallowtail caterpillar, and the beaver. None of these organisms is a secondary consumer, so the black bear is not a tertiary consumer.
The silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not a tertiary consumer."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The black racer is identified as a tertiary consumer because it has an arrow pointing to it from the pine vole, a secondary consumer. The gray fox is also a tertiary consumer for the same reason. The black bear does not qualify as a tertiary consumer because all the organisms it consumes are not secondary consumers, and the silver maple is a producer with no arrows pointing to it.

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 75°F bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 70°F bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The bowl of oatmeal at 75°F has more thermal energy than the bowl at 70°F because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Since both bowls are identical in mass and composition, the only factor affecting their thermal energy is their temperature. The higher temperature (75°F) indicates that the molecules in that bowl are moving more vigorously, thus possessing more thermal energy compared to the cooler bowl at 70°F."

Susan had witnessed a crime, so she made a call to report it. The operator promptly dispatched police to investigate the scene."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference due to the use of ""they"" without a clear antecedent, leaving it ambiguous as to who ""they"" refers to. It could lead to confusion about whether ""they"" refers to the police, the operator, or another group entirely. In contrast, the first answer choice clarifies the pronoun with ""the operator,"" making it clear who is dispatching the police.

SOLUTION: The text presents a situation where Neil's lack of voting is used to conclude that he has no regard for democracy, which implies that the only two choices are to either vote and care about democracy or not vote and not care about it. This is a classic example of a false dichotomy, as it ignores other potential reasons for not voting, such as personal circumstances or beliefs.

The solution fills a closed container that is divided in half by a membrane. The membrane, represented by a dotted line, is permeable to the solute particles.
The diagram shows how the solution can change over time during the process of diffusion."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Solutions	Diffusion across membranes	"In a solution, solute particles move and spread throughout the solvent. The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal."	"Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 8 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 3 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The text indicates that there were initially 8 solute particles on the left side and only 2 on the right side of the membrane. To achieve equilibrium, where there are equal numbers of particles on both sides, more particles needed to move from the left to the right. Since the final state shows 5 particles on each side, it is clear that more solute particles moved to the right than to the left, hence the answer is (1) to the right than to the left."

milk going sour
deep-frying chicken"	['Both are only physical changes.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form different molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then link together in a different way to form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are formed when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Milk going sour is a chemical change. The type of matter in the milk slowly changes. The new matter that is formed gives the milk its sour taste.
Deep-frying chicken is a chemical change. The heat causes the matter in the chicken to change. Cooked chicken and raw chicken are different types of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Cooking is caused by heating. But milk going sour is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: Both milk going sour and deep-frying chicken are classified as chemical changes because they involve a transformation of the substances at a molecular level, resulting in new products. In the case of milk, bacteria convert lactose into lactic acid, which gives it a sour taste. Deep-frying chicken involves the Maillard reaction and other chemical processes that alter the proteins and fats in the chicken, leading to a change in flavor and texture. Therefore, the commonality between the two changes is that they both result in new substances formed through chemical reactions."

Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	When four men's clothing stores closed on Main Street, the number of suppliers went down. There were fewer stores selling men's shirts. So, the supply of men's shirts probably went down.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The closure of four men's clothing stores on Main Street indicates a reduction in the number of suppliers for men's shirts in Lakeside. With fewer stores available to sell these items, it is likely that the overall supply of men's shirts has decreased. This aligns with basic economic principles, where a decrease in the number of suppliers typically leads to a reduction in supply, assuming demand remains constant. Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the supply of men's shirts probably went down."
	Which is more flexible?	['ice rink', 'wool hat']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Materials	Compare properties of materials	"Every object is made of one or more materials. A material is a type of matter. Wood, glass, metal, and plastic are common materials.
A material has different properties. A material's properties tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Some examples of properties are shiny, hard, fragile, and stretchy.
For example, a shiny material reflects a lot of light. A fragile material breaks when you drop it."	"Flexible is a property. A flexible material can be bent without breaking easily.
Look at each picture, one at a time. Imagine bending the material shown in each picture."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A wool hat is typically made from fibers that allow it to stretch and bend without losing its shape, making it more flexible than an ice rink. An ice rink, on the other hand, is a solid surface made of ice that does not bend or flex; it remains rigid. Therefore, when considering the ability to bend without breaking, the wool hat is the more flexible option of the two."

Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but they're awesome runners.
Formal: Though ostriches are flightless, they are remarkably adept runners.
"	"The second sentence is less formal. You can tell because it uses slang (flipped out).
The first sentence uses formal language in place of the slang, so it is more formal overall."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second sentence is the more formal choice because it uses the word ""furious,"" which is a standard descriptor of anger, rather than the slang term ""flipped out"" used in the first sentence. Formal writing typically avoids colloquial expressions, and the first sentence's choice of language suggests a more casual tone.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The magnets will attract each other because they are positioned with opposite poles facing each other. Specifically, the north pole of one magnet is near the south pole of the other, which is a fundamental principle of magnetism: opposite poles attract. Therefore, this configuration leads to an attractive force between the two magnets."

	Based on this information, what is Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?	['solid coloring', 'white spots']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
Winnee is a cow from this group. Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Winnee's genotype for the coat pattern gene is aa. Winnee's genotype of aa has only a alleles. The a allele is for white spots. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots.
To check this answer, consider whether Winnee's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Winnee's genotype of aa has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be white spots."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Winnee has the homozygous genotype aa for the coat pattern gene, which consists of only recessive alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive, meaning that when an organism has two copies of the recessive allele (aa), it will express the trait associated with that allele, which is white spots. Since the allele for solid coloring (A) is dominant, Winnee does not have any A alleles to express that phenotype. Thus, Winnee's phenotype for the coat pattern trait is determined to be white spots."

Skin with sharp spines might help an animal defend itself against predators."	"Look at the picture of the ptarmigan.
During the winter, the ptarmigan has white feathers covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in the snow. The word camouflage means to blend in.

This Arctic wolf has white fur covering its body. It is adapted to be camouflaged in the snow.
The porcupine has black-and-white spines covering its body. It is not adapted to be camouflaged in the snow."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The Arctic wolf has white fur that allows it to blend in with the snowy environment, making it well-adapted for camouflage in such habitats. In contrast, the porcupine's black-and-white spines do not provide effective camouflage in the snow, which would make it more visible to predators. Therefore, the Arctic wolf is the correct choice as it shares the same adaptation of blending in with the snowy surroundings like the ptarmigan."

SOLUTION: The statement is true because the volume of Neptune is indeed more than 50 times that of Earth. To verify this, we calculate 50 times the volume of Earth, which is approximately 54,500 billion km³. Since Neptune's volume is 62,530 billion km³, it exceeds the 50 times volume of Earth, confirming that the initial statement is accurate. Thus, the correct answer is true."
	Is a newspaper a good or a service?	['a service', 'a good']	1		closed choice	grade3	social science	economics	Basic economic principles	Goods and services	"Everything you can buy is either a good or a service.
A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether a newspaper is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is a newspaper something you can touch? Yes.
Is a newspaper a job you might pay someone else to do? No.
So, a newspaper is a good."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A newspaper is classified as a good because it is a physical product that can be touched and held. It is created and distributed for readers to consume information, making it a tangible item rather than a service, which typically involves a job or activity performed for someone else. Since newspapers are produced, sold, and can be owned, they fit the definition of a good."

 | Resources | Number of producers or suppliers | Expected change in demand
Supply goes up | when resources cost less or are easier to get | when there are more producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go up
Supply goes down | when resources cost more or are harder to get | when there are fewer producers or suppliers | when demand is expected to go down
Producers are people or companies that make goods or provide services. Suppliers are people or companies that sell goods or services. New inventions or technologies can also help workers produce goods and services more quickly. As a result of these changes, the supply of a good or service will often go up."	Floods destroyed the cough drop factories in Dayton. The number of producers of cough drops went down. So, the supply of cough drops will probably go down.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The destruction of Dayton's cough drop factories due to floods directly impacts the production capacity of cough drops in that area. With fewer factories available to produce these products, the overall supply of cough drops will likely decrease. As a result, the reduction in the number of producers leads to a diminished supply in the market, making it probable that the overall availability of cough drops will go down."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Mixing sand and gravel is a physical change. Together, the sand and gravel make a mixture. But making this mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Tearing a piece of paper is a physical change. The paper tears into pieces. But each piece is still made of paper.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Both changes involve physical alterations without creating new substances. Mixing sand and gravel results in a mixture, while tearing paper results in smaller pieces of the same material. Neither process involves chemical reactions or changes in the chemical composition of the materials involved. Therefore, the correct choice is that both are only physical changes."

It is a solid.
It is formed in nature.
It is not made by organisms.
It is a pure substance.
It has a fixed crystal structure.
If a substance has all five of these properties, then it is a mineral.
Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter. All minerals are pure substances.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Potassium feldspar has all the properties of a mineral. So, potassium feldspar is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Potassium feldspar exhibits all the essential characteristics that define a mineral. It has a fixed crystal structure, is a solid substance, occurs naturally, and is not derived from biological processes, which are key criteria for mineral classification. Additionally, it is a pure substance, further supporting its classification as a mineral. Therefore, the answer is yes, potassium feldspar is indeed a mineral."

Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.
The symbol may be followed by a subscript. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript tells you the number of atoms in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2. In the formula, the symbol Be represents one beryllium atom. The symbol F followed by the subscript 2 represents two fluorine atoms."	"You can tell whether diamond is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of symbols in its chemical formula. A symbol contains either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for diamond is C. This formula contains one symbol: C for carbon. So, the formula tells you that diamond is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, diamond is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Diamond is classified as an elementary substance because its chemical formula is C, which indicates it consists solely of one element—carbon. Since it is not made up of two or more different elements, it does not qualify as a compound. Thus, according to the definition of elementary substances, which are made of only one chemical element, diamond falls into this category."
	"Which figure of speech is used in this text?
In business, we should consider competition not a threat but a challenge."	['chiasmus', 'antithesis']	1		closed choice	grade11	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Classify the figure of speech: anaphora, antithesis, apostrophe, assonance, chiasmus, understatement	"Figures of speech are words or phrases that use language in a nonliteral or unusual way. They can make writing more expressive.
Anaphora is the repetition of the same word or words at the beginning of several phrases or clauses.
We are united. We are powerful. We are winners.
Antithesis involves contrasting opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure.
I want to help, not to hurt.
Apostrophe is a direct address to an absent person or a nonhuman entity.
Oh, little bird, what makes you sing so beautifully?
Assonance is the repetition of a vowel sound in a series of nearby words.
Try to light the fire.
Chiasmus is an expression in which the second half parallels the first but reverses the order of words.
Never let a fool kiss you or a kiss fool you.
Understatement involves deliberately representing something as less serious or important than it really is.
As you know, it can get a little cold in the Antarctic."	"The text uses antithesis, the contrasting of opposing ideas within a parallel grammatical structure.
The sentence contrasts two ways of looking at competition, as a threat and a challenge."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text employs antithesis because it presents two opposing viewpoints regarding competition: viewing it as a threat versus viewing it as a challenge. This juxtaposition highlights the contrasting nature of these perspectives within a parallel structure, making the distinction clear. Chiasmus, on the other hand, involves a specific inversion of words or phrases, which is not present in this sentence. Therefore, antithesis is the correct choice for the figure of speech used in the text."

['The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.', 'The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1.']	1	The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The problem states that both pairs of magnets are made of the same material and have the same sizes and distances between them. While the magnets in Pair 1 attract and those in Pair 2 repel, this only affects the direction of the magnetic force, not its magnitude. Since all other factors affecting the force are equal, the magnitude of the magnetic force must be the same in both pairs. Thus, the correct answer is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."
	Which brownie has more thermal energy?	['the colder brownie', 'the hotter brownie']	1	Two brownies are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two brownies are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter brownie has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature. Since the two brownies are identical in all other aspects (mass and material), the one with the higher temperature, or the hotter brownie, will possess greater thermal energy. This is because thermal energy is a function of both the temperature of an object and its mass; thus, in this case, the hotter brownie clearly has more thermal energy."

Using polish to remove tarnish from a silver spoon is a ()."	['physical change', 'chemical change']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Identify physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. When paper gets hot enough, it reacts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	"A tarnished silver spoon is one that has become less shiny over time. Polishing the spoon makes it look shiny again.
The polish changes the tarnish into a different type of matter that can be easily wiped away. So, using polish to remove tarnish from silver is a chemical change."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""chemical change"" because the process of using polish to remove tarnish involves a reaction that transforms the tarnish into a different substance. Tarnish is a chemical compound that forms on silver, and the polish reacts with it to change its composition, allowing it to be wiped away. This transformation indicates a chemical change rather than a physical one, as the original tarnished state is altered at a molecular level."
	How long is a garden snail?	['37 meters', '37 kilometers', '37 millimeters']	2	Select the best estimate.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.
The tip of the pencil shown here is only 1 millimeter wide, but the pencil is about 16 centimeters long.
A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a garden snail is 37 millimeters.
37 meters and 37 kilometers are both too long."	"ANSWER: 37 millimeters  
SOLUTION: A garden snail typically measures between 25 to 40 millimeters in length, making 37 millimeters a reasonable estimate for its size. The other options, 37 meters and 37 kilometers, are excessively large and unrealistic for the dimensions of a garden snail. Therefore, 37 millimeters is the most accurate choice given the context of the question."
	Compare the motion of two humpback whales. Which humpback whale was moving at a higher speed?	['a humpback whale that moved 20kilometers in 10hours', 'a humpback whale that moved 30kilometers in 10hours']	1		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each humpback whale moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One humpback whale moved 30 kilometers in 10 hours.
The other humpback whale moved 20 kilometers in 10 hours.
Notice that each humpback whale spent the same amount of time moving. The humpback whale that moved 30 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that humpback whale must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the problem compares the distances traveled by two humpback whales over the same period of time. The whale that traveled 30 kilometers in 10 hours clearly covered more distance than the whale that traveled 20 kilometers in the same time frame. Since speed is calculated as distance divided by time, the whale moving 30 kilometers must have a higher speed than the one moving 20 kilometers. Thus, the correct choice is the humpback whale that moved 30 kilometers."

A vertebrate has a backbone. The backbone is made of many bones in an animal's back. A vertebrate's backbone helps connect the different parts of its body. In the drawings below, each vertebrate's backbone is colored orange.
An invertebrate does not have a backbone. In fact, invertebrates do not have any bones! Some invertebrates have an outer cover on their body called an exoskeleton. Other invertebrates have a soft body."	"A bull ant is an insect. Like other insects, a bull ant is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton.

A minnow is a fish. Like other fish, a minnow is a vertebrate. It has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The bull ant is the only option listed that is classified as an invertebrate. Insects, including bull ants, do not have a backbone and possess an exoskeleton, which categorizes them as invertebrates. In contrast, the black howler, gray tree frog, and minnow are all vertebrates, as they possess backbones. Thus, the correct answer is 0, representing the bull ant."

The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground."	"Look at the picture of the snow leopard.
The snow leopard has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice. The fur can help keep the snow leopard's feet warm. The large pads help spread its weight over a larger area. This allows it to walk on ice without slipping and to walk on snow without sinking in too deep.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The brown bear has furry feet with large pads. Its feet are adapted to walk on snow and ice.
The horse has hooves. Its feet are not adapted to walk on snow and ice. The horse uses its feet to walk and run on surfaces covered by soil."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the brown bear (choice 1) because, like the snow leopard, it has furry feet with large pads adapted for walking on snow and ice. These adaptations help distribute the animal's weight, preventing it from sinking into deep snow and providing better traction on slippery surfaces. In contrast, the horse (choice 0) has hooves that are not suited for such conditions, as they are designed for walking and running on more solid ground, such as soil.

SOLUTION: Both changes are classified as physical changes because they do not alter the chemical composition of the materials involved. The sidewalk heating up in the sun simply increases its temperature without changing its material properties, while carving wood changes the shape of the wood but keeps its chemical identity intact. Therefore, the most accurate choice is that both are only physical changes."

SOLUTION: The allusion to Scheherazade originates from ancient legend, specifically from ""The Arabian Nights,"" a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales. In the story, Scheherazade uses her storytelling skills to delay her execution by captivating the king with her narratives. This reflects the idea of using wit and creativity to navigate difficult situations, which is why Ruth's friends humorously liken her to Scheherazade after her explanation to Mr. Dickerson.

Choice ""Jul"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Aug"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Sep"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Oct"" is incorrect.
Choice ""Nov"" is incorrect.
Choice ""June, July, and August"" is incorrect.
The average precipitation for these three months is different. The average precipitation in August is more than an inch higher than the average precipitation in June and July.
Choice ""March, April, and May"" is incorrect.
The average precipitation for these three months is different. The average precipitation in April and May is more than 3 inches. But, the average precipitation in March is less than 3 inches.
Choice ""September, October, and November"" is incorrect.
The average precipitation in September, October, and November is just over 3 inches. Every other month has an average precipitation that is either higher or lower than these three months."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Based on the analysis, all provided choices are incorrect because each group of months has different average precipitation levels. Specifically, June, July, and August have similar precipitation levels but are not identical, whereas the other groups exhibit significant differences in their averages. Since none of the choices meet the criterion of having the same average precipitation, the answer reflects that none of the options are valid."
	What is the mass of a small candy bar?	['40 kilograms', '40 grams']	1	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose metric units of mass	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using metric units, mass may be written with units of grams or kilograms.
There are 1,000 grams in 1 kilogram. So, 1 gram is much less than 1 kilogram.
A paper clip has a mass of about 1 gram, while a textbook has a mass of about 1 kilogram."	"The better estimate for the mass of a small candy bar is 40 grams.
40 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 40 grams  
SOLUTION: A small candy bar typically weighs around 40 grams, making this choice the most accurate estimate. The alternative option of 40 kilograms is excessively heavy, as it is equivalent to the weight of a large dog or a small child, which is far beyond the weight of a typical candy bar. Therefore, 40 grams is the logical and reasonable choice when considering the mass of a small candy bar."
	Compare the motion of two sailboats. Which sailboat was moving at a lower speed?	['a sailboat that moved 30kilometers in 5hours', 'a sailboat that moved 80kilometers in 5hours']	0		closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving slower will go a shorter distance in that time. It is moving at a lower speed."	"Look at the distance each sailboat moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One sailboat moved 30 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other sailboat moved 80 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each sailboat spent the same amount of time moving. The sailboat that moved 30 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that sailboat must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The sailboat that moved 30 kilometers in 5 hours is the one that had a lower speed. When comparing the two sailboats, we can determine their speeds by calculating the distance traveled in the given time. The first sailboat's speed is 6 kilometers per hour (30 km / 5 hours), while the second sailboat's speed is 16 kilometers per hour (80 km / 5 hours). Since the first sailboat traveled a shorter distance in the same amount of time, it clearly moved at a lower speed."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different shapes.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The question asks about the magnetic force between two pairs of magnets, and the distance between the magnets significantly influences the force's magnitude. Since Pair 2 has a smaller distance between the magnets compared to Pair 1, we can conclude that the magnetic force in Pair 2 is greater. This conclusion is based on the principle that the strength of the magnetic force increases as the distance between the magnets decreases, making option (1) the correct choice."

They can make writing more expressive.
Verbal irony involves saying one thing but implying something very different. People often use verbal irony when they are being sarcastic.

Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
As quiet as a jackhammer suggests that the snoring is loud. A jackhammer is not quiet, and neither is Mr. Hancock's snoring."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The use of verbal irony in the text indicates that the statement ""as quiet as a jackhammer"" is meant to convey the opposite of what it literally says. Since a jackhammer is a notoriously loud tool, the phrase suggests that Mr. Hancock's snoring is, in fact, very loud. This contrast between the literal meaning and the intended implication highlights the irony and emphasizes the disruptive nature of his snoring. Thus, the correct choice is that the snoring is loud."

Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant."	"Conifers use their cones to make seeds. Seeds grow inside the female cones.
Many conifers have thin pointed leaves called needles. The needles make most of the conifer's food. Needles do not make seeds.
Roots take in water and nutrients from the soil. They do not make seeds."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose option (2) ""cones"" because conifers reproduce by producing seeds within their cones. The female cones are responsible for housing and nurturing the seeds as they develop. In contrast, needles are primarily for photosynthesis and roots are for water and nutrient absorption, neither of which are involved in seed production. Thus, ""cones"" is the correct choice for completing the sentence."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.

The north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are oriented such that like poles are facing each other. In this case, the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. According to the properties of magnets, like poles repel each other, which leads to the conclusion that these two magnets will push apart rather than pull together."

More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The first holiday greeting is more formal. It uses more elevated language (Independence Day, the entire staff). The other holiday greeting uses casual language (happy 4 th, the crew) that is more familiar in tone.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first holiday greeting is more formal due to its use of complete phrases and a more professional tone. Phrases like ""Best wishes for an enjoyable Independence Day"" and ""the entire staff"" contribute to a sense of formality and respect. In contrast, the second greeting, ""Happy 4th from the crew,"" employs a casual tone and informal language, making it less suitable for formal contexts.

It evaporates and becomes gas in the air.
Dry dirt is left behind. But the dirt and the water are still made of the same types of matter as before."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""0"" because mud drying out in the sun is a physical change rather than a chemical change. During this process, the water in the mud evaporates, transitioning from a liquid state to a gaseous state, but the chemical composition of the mud remains unchanged. The components of the mud, such as soil and minerals, are still present after the water evaporates, indicating that no new substances have formed.

11 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 11 liters  
SOLUTION: A large soup pot is typically designed to hold a substantial volume of liquid, often used for making large quantities of soup or broth. In this context, 11 milliliters is an impractically small volume for any cooking pot, as it would barely hold a few drops. Conversely, 11 liters is a more realistic and appropriate estimate for the capacity of a large soup pot, as it can accommodate multiple servings of soup, making it suitable for cooking in larger quantities. Therefore, 11 liters is clearly the better estimate."

In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.

The choice of 65 gallons aligns with common bathtub capacities, which usually range from about 40 to 80 gallons. In contrast, 65 cups and 65 fluid ounces are far too small to represent the volume of a bathtub, making 65 gallons the most reasonable and accurate estimate. Therefore, I chose 65 gallons as the best estimate for the volume of a bathtub."

Alana thinks Mr. Cline is a Luddite because he doesn't own a cell phone."	['the Bible', 'British history']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Luddite is British history.
In the early nineteenth century, factories were replacing the jobs of craftsmen. Some of these craftsmen banded together to destroy the new machinery; those who did so were called Luddites.
The allusion Luddite means a person opposed to new technology."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The term ""Luddite"" originates from British history, specifically referring to a group of early 19th-century English workers who protested against industrialization and the introduction of machinery that threatened their jobs. The allusion to Mr. Cline being a Luddite implies he is resistant to adopting new technology, such as cell phones. The historical context of Luddites highlights their opposition to modern advancements, making this reference firmly rooted in British history rather than the Bible."

A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
This problem can be fixed by replacing the pronoun with its missing antecedent.
The advertisements say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes."	"The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference. The pronoun it could refer to Emily's skirt or the blouse.
The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. It has been replaced with the blouse.
If Emily's skirt doesn't match the blouse, she will have to exchange the blouse for another item."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference with the use of ""it,"" which could refer to either Emily's skirt or the blouse, creating ambiguity. In contrast, the first answer choice specifically names ""the blouse,"" removing any confusion about what is being exchanged. Clear pronoun references are essential for effective communication, and this distinction highlights the importance of clarity in writing. Thus, the second choice is the one with the vague reference."
	Which object has more thermal energy?	['a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 40°C', 'a bowl of oatmeal at a temperature of 25°C']	0	The objects are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How is temperature related to thermal energy?	"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two bowls of oatmeal have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 40°C bowl of oatmeal is hotter than the 25°C bowl of oatmeal, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The bowl of oatmeal at 40°C has more thermal energy than the bowl at 25°C because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. Since both bowls are identical in mass and composition, the one with the higher temperature (40°C) contains more kinetic energy in its molecules compared to the cooler one (25°C). Therefore, the temperature difference indicates that the 40°C bowl has greater thermal energy."

The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks."	"Look at the picture of the white-backed vulture.

The bald eagle has a sharp hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to tear through meat.
The hoopoe has a long, thin beak. Its beak is not adapted to tear through meat."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the bald eagle because it has a sharp hooked beak that is specifically adapted to tear through meat, similar to the adaptation seen in the white-backed vulture. In contrast, the hoopoe's long, thin beak is not suited for tearing meat, which makes it unsuitable for this task. Therefore, the bald eagle is the correct choice as it shares the same type of beak adaptation for feeding on meat."

Carbon monoxide is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	1	Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas that is produced by volcanic eruptions and wildfires. The chemical formula for carbon monoxide is CO.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms."	"You can tell whether carbon monoxide is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for carbon monoxide, CO, contains two atomic symbols: C for carbon and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that carbon monoxide is composed of two chemical elements bonded together.
Since carbon monoxide is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon monoxide is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""1"" because carbon monoxide (CO) consists of two different elements: carbon (C) and oxygen (O). A compound is defined as a substance formed when two or more elements chemically bond together, which is the case with carbon monoxide. The presence of both carbon and oxygen in its chemical formula confirms that it is not an elementary substance, but rather a compound formed from these two elements."

A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A red kangaroo's scientific name is Macropus rufus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus.
Lepus americanus is in the genus Lepus. The first word of its scientific name is Lepus. So, Lepus americanus and Macropus rufus are not in the same genus.
Lynx rufus and Macropus rufus are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Lynx rufus and Macropus rufus have the same species name within their genus, rufus. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Lynx rufus is in the genus Lynx, and Macropus rufus is in the genus Macropus.

SOLUTION: The red kangaroo's scientific name is Macropus rufus, which indicates that it belongs to the genus Macropus. Among the options provided, Macropus giganteus also begins with the genus name Macropus, meaning it is in the same genus as the red kangaroo. In contrast, both Lynx rufus and Lepus americanus belong to different genera (Lynx and Lepus, respectively), which confirms that they are not in the same genus as the red kangaroo. Therefore, the correct answer is Macropus giganteus."

"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 440 miles moved the farthest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the highest speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which motorboat was moving at the highest speed, we need to compare the distances traveled by each motorboat in the same amount of time (10 hours). The speeds can be calculated by dividing the distance by time. The motorboat that moved 440 miles south had the highest speed, as it traveled the greatest distance in the same time frame compared to the other motorboats.

Inherited and acquired traits are gained in different ways.
Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Humans are not born knowing how to drive a car. Instead, many people learn how to drive when they are older. So, driving is an acquired trait.

changing direction."	The hockey puck is slowing down. So, the hockey puck is accelerating.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The hockey puck is experiencing a decrease in speed as it slides across a rough patch of ice, which indicates that it is undergoing negative acceleration. In physics, any change in velocity, including a decrease in speed, is classified as acceleration. Therefore, since the puck is slowing down, it is indeed accelerating, making option (1) the correct choice."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is stronger when the magnets are closer together."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.
The magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 1. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the magnetic forces between two pairs of magnets based on their distance from each other. According to the information provided, the strength of the magnetic force increases as the distance between magnets decreases. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are stated to be closer together than those in Pair 1, it follows that the magnetic force in Pair 2 is stronger than in Pair 1. Therefore, option 2 is the correct choice."

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"The fruit fly's genotype for the body color gene is BB. The fruit fly's genotype of BB has only B allelles. The B allele is for a gray body. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body.
To check this answer, consider whether the fruit fly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of BB has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the body color trait must be a gray body."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The fruit fly's genotype is homozygous BB, which means it has two dominant alleles for the body color trait. The allele B corresponds to a gray body, while the allele b for a black body is recessive. Since the fly has the dominant genotype, it will express the gray body phenotype. Therefore, the correct choice is (0) a gray body."

Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Where Sarah lives, winter is the rainiest season of the year.
This passage tells you about the usual precipitation where Sarah lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The passage provides information about the typical precipitation pattern in Sarah's location, specifically noting that winter is the rainiest season. This indicates a long-term trend rather than a specific weather event, which aligns with the definition of climate as the overall pattern of weather in a particular area over time. In contrast, weather would refer to the atmospheric conditions at a specific time. Therefore, the passage describes the climate."
	What is the mass of a floor lamp?

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Mass is a measurement of how much matter something contains.
There are many different units of mass. When you are using customary units, mass may be written with units of ounces, pounds, or tons.
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound and 2,000 pounds in 1 ton.
So, 1 ounce is less than 1 pound and much less than 1 ton.
A slice of bread has a mass of about 1 ounce, while a can of beans has a mass of about 1 pound. A small car has a mass of about 1 ton."	"The best estimate for the mass of a floor lamp is 9 pounds.
9 ounces is too light and 9 tons is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The mass of a floor lamp is best estimated at 9 pounds because this weight is typical for most household lamps, which are designed to be portable and manageable. The option of 9 ounces is far too light, as it would not account for the materials used in the lamp's construction, such as metal or glass. Conversely, 9 tons is excessively heavy and unrealistic for a floor lamp, making 9 pounds the most accurate and reasonable choice."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	Magnets	Compare strengths of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The explanation provided indicates that the strength of the magnetic force is influenced by the distance between the magnets. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than those in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is indeed weaker. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1. This aligns with the principle that increased distance results in a diminished magnetic force."

A salt water crocodile is a reptile. Like other reptiles, a salt water crocodile is a vertebrate. It has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: The black orb weaver spider is the only invertebrate among the choices provided. Invertebrates are animals that do not possess a backbone, and spiders, including the black orb weaver, belong to this category, characterized by having an exoskeleton instead. In contrast, the fruit bat, seahorse, and salt water crocodile are all vertebrates, as they possess a backbone. Therefore, the correct selection for an invertebrate is the black orb weaver spider."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a bench is 3 meters.
3 centimeters is too short."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: A bench is typically used for seating and is designed to accommodate multiple people. The choice of 3 meters is a more realistic estimate for a bench's length, as standard benches usually range from about 1.5 meters to 2 meters, and larger ones can be even longer. In contrast, 3 centimeters is impractically short for a bench, making it unsuitable for any functional purpose. Therefore, 3 meters is the better estimate for the length of a bench."

['spores', 'an adult moss plant']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a moss.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Moss plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Moss plants use their male and female parts for sexual reproduction. The male parts produce sperm. Moss live in damp environments, and moss sperm can travel through water to the female parts.
The sperm fuse with eggs in the female part. This is called fertilization. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm from a moss plant fertilizes an egg from the same plant. Cross-fertilization happens when a sperm from one moss plant fertilizes an egg from a different moss plant.
The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again."	"An adult moss plant produces eggs and sperm.
Spores may germinate and grow into an adult moss plant, but spores do not produce eggs and sperm themselves."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question asks what produces sperm and eggs, and the choices given are spores and an adult moss plant. In the life cycle of a moss, it is the adult moss plant that produces both sperm and eggs through its gametophyte stage. Spores are a means of reproduction but do not directly produce sperm and eggs; instead, they germinate and grow into new moss plants that can then produce gametes. Therefore, the correct answer is an adult moss plant, which corresponds to choice (1)."

For example, the symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.
Scientists can use models to represent molecules. A ball-and-stick model of a molecule is shown below. This model represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.

The ball represents one atom of that element."	"Count the number of chemical elements represented in the model. Then, decide if chloromethane is an elementary substance or a compound.
In this model, each ball is labeled with C for carbon, H for hydrogen, or Cl for chlorine. So, the model shows you that chloromethane is made of three chemical elements bonded together.
Substances made of two or more chemical elements bonded together are compounds. So, chloromethane is a compound."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Chloromethane is classified as a compound because it is composed of three different chemical elements: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and chlorine (Cl). Compounds are defined as substances formed from two or more elements that are chemically bonded together. In the case of chloromethane, the presence of these three distinct elements confirms its status as a compound rather than an elementary substance, which would consist of only one type of element."

You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The analysis of the two pairs of magnets indicates that Magnet B in Pair 2 is smaller than Magnet B in Pair 1. Since the size of the magnets influences the magnitude of the magnetic force, and the smaller magnet will exert a lesser force, it logically follows that the magnetic force in Pair 2 is smaller than in Pair 1.

So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The statement that the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs is true because the magnets in both pairs are made of the same material and have the same size. The distance between the magnets is also identical in both pairs, which means that the factors affecting the magnitude of the magnetic force are consistent. While the direction of the force differs—attraction in Pair 2 and repulsion in Pair 1—the magnitude remains unchanged due to the aforementioned similarities.

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	Limestone is a rock that forms from ocean sediment. The sediment in limestone is made mostly of the shells of marine organisms. But the rock itself is not made by organisms. It forms deep below Earth's surface when layers of sediment are pressed together to form rock.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Limestone is classified as a rock because it is formed from the accumulation and compaction of sediment, specifically ocean sediment that often contains calcite from marine organisms' shells. Although it is composed of minerals, including calcite, it does not have a fixed crystal structure and is not considered a single mineral. The defined properties of limestone, such as being solid, naturally occurring, and formed from sediment, confirm its classification as a rock rather than a mineral."

Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample B has more mass than each particle in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to the temperature of the gas. In this scenario, although both samples have the same number of particles and the same average speed, the particles in sample B have a greater mass. Since kinetic energy is given by the formula KE = 1/2 mv², the heavier particles in sample B will have a higher average kinetic energy than the lighter particles in sample A. Consequently, sample B must have the higher temperature."
	"Complete the sentence so that it uses personification.
The alarm () the burglar, scaring him away."

It is a figure of speech that can be used to make writing more interesting or to emphasize a point.
The trees danced in the wind.
The word danced describes the trees as if they were people. Unlike people, however, trees can't actually dance. Instead, the personification suggests that the trees are moving."	Complete the sentence with the phrase screamed at. It describes the alarm as if it were a screaming person.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose ""screamed at"" because it imbues the alarm with human-like qualities, suggesting it can produce a loud, alarming sound akin to a person screaming. This enhances the sense of urgency and fear in the scenario, as it portrays the alarm not just as a device, but as an active participant in the event, directly confronting the burglar. In contrast, while ""blared at"" conveys a loud noise, it lacks the vivid imagery and emotional weight of personification that ""screamed at"" provides."

['repel', 'attract']	0	Two magnets are placed as shown.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Magnets	Identify magnets that attract or repel	"Magnets can pull or push on other magnets without touching them. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes are called magnetic forces.
Magnetic forces are strongest at the magnets' poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles: a north pole (N) and a south pole (S).
Here are some examples of magnets. Their poles are shown in different colors and labeled.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles.
If opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel."	"To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.
Both poles of each magnet line up with both poles of the other magnet. The north pole of each magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. Like poles repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are oriented with like poles facing each other. In this case, the north pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet. According to the laws of magnetism, like poles repel, which leads to the conclusion that these magnets will not attract but instead push away from one another."

The word hate does not rhyme. It ends with a different sound."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The word ""hate"" does not rhyme with ""duck"" and ""truck"" because it has a different vowel and ending sound. ""Duck"" and ""truck"" both share the ""uck"" ending, creating a rhyme between them.

	Based on this information, what is Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait?	['green body feathers', 'blue body feathers']	1	"In a group of budgerigar parakeets, some individuals have green body feathers and others have blue body feathers. In this group, the gene for the body feather color trait has two alleles. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B).
Tiki is a budgerigar parakeet from this group. Tiki has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"Tiki's genotype for the body feather color gene is bb. Tiki's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for blue body feathers. So, Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers.
To check this answer, consider whether Tiki's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for blue body feathers (b) is recessive to the allele for green body feathers (B). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Tiki's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Tiki's phenotype for the body feather color trait must be blue body feathers."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Tiki has the homozygous genotype bb for the body feather color gene, where 'b' is the allele for blue body feathers. Since the allele for blue body feathers is recessive, an organism with the genotype bb will express the blue phenotype. The dominant allele (B) for green body feathers is not present in Tiki's genotype, confirming that Tiki's phenotype must be blue body feathers. Therefore, the correct choice is (1) blue body feathers."

Past tense verbs tell you about something that has already happened.
Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mom will open the jar of jelly"" is in future tense, which is indicated by the use of the auxiliary verb ""will"" before the main verb ""open."" This construction is typical of future tense sentences, as it describes an action that is expected to occur later. The phrase clearly indicates that the action of opening the jar has not yet happened but is planned for the future. Thus, the correct choice is future tense, represented by the number 1."
	Select the part whose main job is to use energy from sunlight to make sugar in a plant cell.	['chromosomes', 'chloroplasts', 'cell membrane', 'vacuole']	1		closed choice	grade7	natural science	biology	Cells	Identify functions of plant cell parts	"Plant cells are made up of many different parts. Each cell part has a function that helps the cell survive and grow.
Some cell parts are called organelles. Organelles are cell structures that are surrounded by their own membranes. Here are some of the organelles in plant cells:
Chloroplasts and mitochondria work together to help the cell get the energy it needs. The chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. The mitochondria break down this sugar and release energy that the cell can use for all of its activities.
The nucleus directs cell activities by sending instructions to different parts of the cell. The nucleus contains structures called chromosomes. The chromosomes are made mostly of hereditary material called DNA. DNA contains information that the cell uses for growth and activities. These instructions tell ribosomes how to build molecules called proteins, which make up cell structures and help chemical reactions happen in the cell.
The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that helps ribosomes build proteins. The nucleus sends instructions for making proteins to ribosomes. Ribosomes can attach to the endoplamic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum and ribosomes use these instructions to make proteins that the cell needs to survive and grow.
After proteins are made in the endoplasmic reticulum, they can be transferred to the Golgi. The Golgi is an organelle made up of flat, stacked membranes. The Golgi sorts and packages proteins and other substances. Then, the Golgi sends these substances to different parts of the cell. Some of these substances are sent to the cell membrane and released from the cell.
In plant cells, the vacuole stores waste, water, and nutrients such as sugar. Most plant cells have one vacuole.
Other cell parts are not surrounded by their own membranes. These cell parts are not organelles.
The cell wall is the cell's tough outer covering. It gives the cell strength and stiffness and helps the cell keep its shape.
On the inside of the cell wall is a thin layer called the cell membrane. This layer is a membrane, but it does not have a membrane surrounding it, so it is not an organelle. The cell membrane controls which substances enter and leave the cell.
The cytoplasm is a thick liquid that fills the space inside the cell. The cytoplasm also helps the cell keep its shape and supports the other cell parts."	"Chloroplasts use photosynthesis to make sugar. First, chloroplasts capture energy from sunlight. Then, they use this energy to turn water and carbon dioxide gas into sugar, the plant cell's food.
A plant cell may have many chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Chloroplasts are the organelles in plant cells responsible for photosynthesis, the process by which they convert sunlight into chemical energy in the form of sugar. They contain chlorophyll, the green pigment that captures light energy. During photosynthesis, chloroplasts utilize water and carbon dioxide, transforming them into glucose, which serves as food for the plant. Other options listed, such as chromosomes, cell membrane, and vacuole, do not have the primary function of converting sunlight into energy."

Open secret is a contradiction, because open describes something that is freely or publicly known, and a secret is hidden."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The phrase ""open secret"" is a classic example of an oxymoron, where two opposing concepts are juxtaposed to create a unique meaning. In this case, ""open"" implies that something is widely known, while ""secret"" denotes that it is meant to be concealed. This contradiction effectively conveys the irony of the situation, as it highlights that although Bryce's book writing is not openly discussed, it is, paradoxically, a well-known fact among his friends.

Some fossils are formed from body parts such as bones or shells. Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.
Fossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.
The relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers."	"Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.
Compare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is younger:
The fern fossil is in a shallower layer in the rock sequence than the dinosaur footprint fossil. So, the fern fossil is most likely younger than the dinosaur footprint fossil."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: In the context of sedimentary rock layers, younger fossils are typically found in shallower (higher) layers, while older fossils are located deeper within the layers. In this case, the fern fossil is positioned in a shallower layer compared to the dinosaur footprint fossil. Therefore, the fern fossil is considered to be younger than the dinosaur footprint fossil, making it the more likely answer."

Arrows show how matter moves.
A food web has arrows that point from one organism to another. Each arrow shows the direction that matter moves when one organism eats another organism. An arrow starts from the organism that is eaten. The arrow points to the organism that is doing the eating.
An organism in a food web can have more than one arrow pointing from it. This shows that the organism is eaten by more than one other organism in the food web.
An organism in a food web can also have more than one arrow pointing to it. This shows that the organism eats more than one other organism in the food web."	"Secondary consumers eat primary consumers, and primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, secondary consumers have arrows pointing to them from primary consumers. Primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The swallowtail caterpillar has an arrow pointing to it from the persimmon tree. The persimmon tree is not a primary consumer, so the swallowtail caterpillar is not a secondary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a primary consumer, so the beaver is not a secondary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a secondary consumer.
The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver. The swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver are primary consumers, so the black bear is a secondary consumer.
The bobcat has an arrow pointing to it from the beaver. The beaver is a primary consumer, so the bobcat is a secondary consumer."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The black bear is identified as a secondary consumer because it has arrows pointing to it from two primary consumers: the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver. In a food web, secondary consumers feed on primary consumers, which in this case are the organisms that directly consume producers. Since both the swallowtail caterpillar and the beaver are primary consumers that rely on producers for their energy, the black bear, which preys on them, fits the definition of a secondary consumer."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature."	The two blocks of iron have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 95°F block is hotter than the 70°F block, it has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The two objects in question are identical in mass (8 kilograms) but differ in temperature, with one being at 70°F and the other at 95°F. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; as the temperature of an object increases, its thermal energy also increases. Therefore, the block of iron at 95°F has more thermal energy than the block at 70°F, making it the correct choice."
	Which block of steel has less thermal energy?	['the hotter block of steel', 'the colder block of steel']	1	Two 4-kilogram blocks of steel are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy."	The two blocks of steel are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder block of steel has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The colder block of steel has less thermal energy because thermal energy is directly related to temperature. In this case, both blocks have the same mass, but the hotter block has a higher temperature, which means it contains more thermal energy. Therefore, the colder block, having a lower temperature, must have less thermal energy compared to the hotter block."

An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
The protean nature of the disease makes it difficult to diagnose.
The word protean is an allusion to the sea god Proteus in Greek mythology. Because the sea is constantly changing, to describe something as protean suggests that it is variable or in flux."	"The source of the allusion Scheherazade is ancient legend.
The Arabian Nights presents the ancient legend of how Scheherazade successfully postpones her imminent death by mesmerizing her captor with a thousand and one fascinating tales.
The allusion Scheherazade means a person who uses his or her arts to distract someone and avoid consequences."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The allusion to Scheherazade originates from ancient legend, specifically from the collection known as ""One Thousand and One Nights"" or ""Arabian Nights."" In this tale, Scheherazade tells captivating stories to the king to delay her execution, showcasing her cleverness and storytelling ability. This context aligns with the situation described in the sentence, where Wanda's friends liken her to Scheherazade for her ability to explain and possibly charm Mr. Blake, suggesting she is using her narrative skills to navigate a challenging situation."
	Is there a surplus or shortage of chocolate chip cookies?	['surplus', 'shortage']	1	The grocery store has chocolate chip cookies on sale for $2 per box. There are 20 boxes available. At that price, 35 people want to buy a box.	closed choice	grade5	social science	economics	Supply and demand	Identify shortage and surplus	"There is a surplus if there is too much for sale at a given price.
There is a shortage if there is not enough for sale at a given price.
Surpluses and shortages usually happen when people who are selling goods or services charge too much or too little.
When the price is too high, consumers will not want to buy much of the good or service. The quantity demanded will be less than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a surplus.
When the price is too low, too many consumers will want to buy the good or service. The quantity demanded will be more than the quantity supplied. So, there will be a shortage."	"At the current price, there are not enough cookies for sale. There are 20 boxes for sale, but 35 people want to buy a box.
So, there is a shortage of cookies."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A shortage occurs when the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied at a given price. In this scenario, the grocery store has 20 boxes of chocolate chip cookies available for sale, while 35 people want to purchase a box at the price of $2. Since the demand (35 boxes) surpasses the supply (20 boxes), it indicates a shortage of chocolate chip cookies at that price."

A soft object changes shape when pressed or squeezed. The soccer shorts are soft.
You can see clearly through a transparent object. The soccer shorts are not transparent."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the answer ""soft"" because the description indicates that the soccer shorts are soft and can change shape when pressed or squeezed. The other option, ""transparent,"" does not apply to the soccer shorts, as they are not see-through. Therefore, the better choice that matches the property of the object is soft."

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"

Hematite is a mineral.
A skull is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
A skull is made by a living thing. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, a skull is not a mineral.
Quartz is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: A skull is not a mineral because it is made by a living organism, whereas minerals are naturally occurring substances that are not produced by living things. Additionally, while minerals are pure substances, a skull is composed of various organic materials and thus does not qualify as a pure substance.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force.

Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The analysis of the magnets shows that in Pair 1, Magnet B is larger than in Pair 2, where Magnet B is smaller. Since the size of the magnets directly affects the magnitude of the magnetic force, and Magnet A remains constant in size across both pairs, the larger Magnet B in Pair 1 results in a greater magnetic force compared to the smaller Magnet B in Pair 2. Therefore, the correct statement is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1."

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The first graduation announcement is more formal. It uses more ceremonious language (proud to announce). The other graduation announcement uses more conversational language (we couldn't be more proud!).	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first graduation announcement (""We are proud to announce the graduation of Lester Horton."") is more formal due to its structured and traditional phrasing, which is typical of formal announcements. It presents the information in a straightforward manner, emphasizing the act of announcing the graduation. In contrast, the second announcement (""Lester Horton is graduating, and we couldn't be more proud!"") has a more casual and conversational tone, focusing on emotional expression rather than formality, which makes it less suitable for formal occasions."

"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Where Meg lives, winds blowing from the northeast are rare in July.
This passage tells you about the usual wind pattern where Meg lives. It does not describe what the weather is like on a particular day. So, this passage describes the climate."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The passage refers to the wind patterns in July, indicating a long-term trend rather than a specific weather event. Climate encompasses the average conditions and patterns over a longer period, while weather describes short-term atmospheric conditions. Since the passage discusses the rarity of northeast winds during a specific month, it implies a climatic characteristic of the region rather than a momentary weather phenomenon."

Volume is a measurement of how much space something takes up.
There are many different units of volume. When you are using metric units, volume may be written in units of milliliters or liters.
There are 1,000 milliliters in 1 liter. So, 1 milliliter is much less than 1 liter.
A raindrop has a volume of about 20 milliliters, while a large soda bottle has a volume of 2 liters. The flask shown here measures volumes up to 500 milliliters."	"The better estimate for the volume of a bathroom sink is 8 liters.
8 milliliters is too little."	"ANSWER: 8 liters  
SOLUTION: A typical bathroom sink has a volume that can accommodate several liters of water, especially when considering the basin's size and depth. The choice of 8 milliliters is far too small, as it would not be practical for a sink's capacity. In contrast, 8 liters is a reasonable estimate for the volume of a standard bathroom sink, as it allows for enough space to hold water for washing hands, face, or other small tasks. Thus, 8 liters is clearly the better estimate."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=200x200 at 0x312CA8D70>	Is ocean water a solid, a liquid, or a gas?	['a gas', 'a solid', 'a liquid']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"Ocean water is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour some ocean water into a bucket, the ocean water will take the shape of the bucket. But the ocean water will still take up the same amount of space."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Ocean water is classified as a liquid because it flows and takes the shape of its container, whether it be a bucket, a glass, or the ocean itself. Unlike solids, which maintain a fixed shape, and gases, which expand to fill their container, liquids have a definite volume but can change their shape. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is option (2) a liquid."

Since poetry is between the guide words plump - prevail, it would be found on that page."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: To determine which word would be found on the dictionary page with the guide words ""plump"" and ""prevail,"" we need to arrange the choices alphabetically. The word ""poetry"" comes before ""prevail"" and after ""plump,"" placing it within the range of the guide words.

	"Complete the sentence.
Bleaching hair is a ()."	['chemical change', 'physical change']	0		closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Chemical reactions	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Matter is made of very small particles called atoms. Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, water vaporizing is a physical change. Liquid water and water vapor are made of the same type of matter: water."	Bleaching hair is a chemical change. Hair contains colorful matter called pigment. The bleach reacts with the pigment and turns it into a different type of matter. The new matter gives the hair a lighter color than before.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""chemical change"" because bleaching hair involves a reaction between the bleach and the pigment in the hair. This reaction alters the chemical composition of the pigment, resulting in a new substance that has a lighter color. Unlike a physical change, which would only alter the appearance without changing the underlying structure, bleaching fundamentally changes the hair at a molecular level. Thus, it is categorized as a chemical change."

The words hands and ice are compared using the word as. So, the sentence uses a simile."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""On that winter morning, Linda's hands were as cold as ice"" employs a simile because it uses the word ""as"" to make a comparison between Linda's hands and ice. This indicates that her hands are being described in relation to the temperature of ice, which is a characteristic of similes. In contrast, a metaphor would imply that Linda's hands are ice without using comparative words. Thus, the correct choice is simile, represented by the number 0."

A property of an object can tell you how it looks, feels, tastes, or smells. Properties can also tell you how an object will behave when something happens to it.
Different objects can have properties in common. You can use these properties to put objects into groups. Grouping objects by their properties is called classification."	"Look at each object.
For each object, decide if it has that property.
A lemon has a sour taste. All three objects are sour.
You can see clearly through a transparent object. The green apple and the lemon are not transparent.
A translucent object lets light through. But you cannot see clearly through a translucent object. The green apple is not translucent.
The property that all three objects have in common is sour."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying a common property among three objects: a lemon, a green apple, and an unspecified third object. I analyzed the choices: ""sour,"" ""translucent,"" and ""transparent."" The lemon is known for its sour taste, and while the green apple is also generally considered sour, the other properties (translucent and transparent) do not apply to all three objects consistently. Therefore, the best answer is that all three objects share the sour property."

Then compare the result to the volume of Uranus. The volume of Uranus is 68,300 billion km^3, which is less than 82,713 billion km^3. So, the volume of Uranus is less than one-tenth the volume of Saturn."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The statement is true. The volume of Saturn is approximately 1,500,000 billion km^3, and one-tenth of this volume is about 150,000 billion km^3. The volume of Uranus, which is 68,300 billion km^3, is indeed less than this calculated value of one-tenth of Saturn's volume. Therefore, the comparison confirms that the volume of Uranus is less than one-tenth of the volume of Saturn, making the statement true."

Savanna grasslands have the following features: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. So, the following statements describe the Cerrado ecosystem: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. It has a rainy season and a dry season. It has warm summers and warm winters. The following statement does not describe the Cerrado: warm summers and warm winters, a rainy season and a dry season, and soil that is poor in nutrients. It has cool summers and long, cold winters.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The Cerrado ecosystem is characterized by a distinct rainy season and a dry season, which aligns with the features typical of savanna grasslands. The statement about having cool summers and long, cold winters does not apply to the Cerrado, as it generally experiences warm temperatures year-round. Therefore, the correct choice is option (0), which accurately describes the seasonal weather patterns of the Cerrado."

The two glasses of orange juice have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 70°F glass of orange juice is colder than the 80°F glass of orange juice, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question asks which object has less thermal energy between two identical glasses of orange juice, differing only in temperature. Since thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object, the glass at 70°F will have less thermal energy than the one at 80°F. Therefore, the 200-gram glass of orange juice at 70°F (choice 0) has less thermal energy compared to the one at 80°F (choice 1)."

The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks."	"Look at the picture of the military macaw.
The military macaw has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts. The military macaw uses its thick beak to crack the shell of a nut by squeezing it. The hooked shape of the beak can help the bird hold the nut in place while cracking it.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The palm cockatoo has a thick hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to crack large, hard nuts.
The blue rock pigeon has a short, thin beak. Its beak is not adapted to crack large, hard nuts."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The palm cockatoo has a thick hooked beak that is specifically adapted to crack large, hard nuts, similar to the military macaw. In contrast, the blue rock pigeon has a short, thin beak, which is not suitable for cracking such hard shells. Therefore, the palm cockatoo is the correct choice as it shares the beak adaptation necessary for this task."

It started raining, so we ran inside."	Liam borrowed my book he enjoyed it is a run-on sentence. It has two sentences that are joined without end punctuation: Liam borrowed my book and He enjoyed it.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Liam borrowed my book he enjoyed it"" is a run-on sentence because it combines two independent clauses without proper punctuation or a conjunction, making it grammatically incorrect. In contrast, the sentence ""Coach Haley talked to her team before the game"" is a complete and correct sentence with a subject and a verb, and it does not suffer from this issue. Thus, choice (0) is the run-on sentence."

To accomplish this purpose, advertisements use three types of persuasive strategies, or appeals:
Appeals to ethos, or character, show that the writer or speaker is trustworthy or is an authority on a subject. An ad that appeals to ethos might do one of the following:
say that a brand has been trusted for many years
note that a brand is recommended by a respected organization or celebrity
include a quote from a ""real person"" who shares the audience's values
Appeals to logos, or reason, use logic and specific evidence. An ad that appeals to logos might do one of the following:
use graphs or charts to display information
mention the results of scientific studies
explain the science behind a product or service
Appeals to pathos, or emotion, use feelings rather than facts to persuade the audience. An ad that appeals to pathos might do one of the following:
trigger a fear, such as the fear of embarrassment
appeal to a desire, such as the desire to appear attractive
link the product to a positive feeling, such as adventure, love, or luxury"	The ad appeals to ethos, or character. It includes a recommendation from a respected organization.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The ad primarily uses ethos, which is an appeal to credibility and character. It gains trust by including a recommendation from a respected organization, suggesting that the product or service is reliable and endorsed by authority figures. This tactic aims to persuade the audience by establishing the credibility of the message and the trustworthiness of the brand, rather than relying solely on logical reasoning (logos) or emotional responses (pathos)."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	All three meatballs have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 17°C meatball is the coldest, it has the least thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The thermal energy of an object is directly related to its temperature; the lower the temperature, the less thermal energy it possesses. In this case, the meatball at 17°C has the lowest temperature among the three options, indicating it has the least thermal energy. The other two meatballs, at 25°C and 35°C, have higher temperatures and therefore greater thermal energy compared to the 17°C meatball. Thus, the correct choice is the meatball at a temperature of 17°C."

She follows the boat as it moves on the water.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Identify pushes and pulls	"A force is a push or a pull that one object applies to a second object.
The direction of a push is away from the object that is pushing.
The direction of a pull is toward the object that is pulling."	The boat applies a force to the water skier. This force causes the water skier to move across the water. The direction of this force is toward the boat. This force is a pull.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The correct choice is ""pull"" because the boat exerts a force on the water skier that draws her toward it as it moves forward. This pulling force is what enables the skier to glide across the water in the same direction as the boat. A push would imply a force acting away from the boat, which does not accurately describe the interaction between the boat and the skier. Therefore, the force from the boat that facilitates the skier's movement is indeed a pull."

2-Chloroethanol is ()."	['a compound', 'an elementary substance']	0	2‑Chloroethanol is a poisonous substance used to make chemicals that kill insects. The chemical formula for 2-chloroethanol is C2H5ClO.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using chemical formulas	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
The atomic symbol for each chemical element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one atomic symbol.
The atomic symbol in a chemical formula may be followed by a small number written lower than the symbol. This number is called a subscript. A subscript is included when the atoms in the elementary substance are bonded to form molecules. The subscript shows how many atoms are in each molecule.
For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen, O2, has a subscript of 2. This subscript shows that the atomic symbol O represents two atoms. The elementary substance O2 and the chemical element represented by the atomic symbol O are both named oxygen. So, the formula tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple atomic symbols.
The chemical elements in a compound are bonded together in a fixed ratio. This ratio is shown in a compound's chemical formula.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. So, the ratio of beryllium atoms to fluorine atoms is 1 to 2. This ratio is shown in the chemical formula for beryllium fluoride, BeF2. There is no subscript following the atomic symbol Be because that symbol represents one atom. The subscript 2 follows the atomic symbol F to show that the symbol represents two atoms."	"You can tell whether 2-chloroethanol is an elementary substance or a compound by counting the number of atomic symbols in its chemical formula. An atomic symbol consists of either one capital letter or a capital letter followed by one or two lowercase letters.
The chemical formula for 2-chloroethanol, C2 H5 ClO, contains four atomic symbols: C for carbon, H for hydrogen, Cl for chlorine, and O for oxygen. So, the formula tells you that 2-chloroethanol is composed of four chemical elements bonded together.
Since 2-chloroethanol is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, 2-chloroethanol is a compound."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because 2-chloroethanol is composed of multiple elements, specifically carbon (C), hydrogen (H), chlorine (Cl), and oxygen (O), as indicated by its chemical formula C2H5ClO. This composition confirms that it is a compound rather than an elementary substance, which consists of only one type of atom. The presence of more than one atomic symbol in the formula signifies that it is not a pure element but rather a chemical compound formed by the combination of different elements."

11 feet, 11 yards, and 11 miles are all too long."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: The best estimate for the length of a paintbrush is 11 inches because paintbrushes are typically used for detailed work and are designed to be manageable in size. Lengths such as 11 feet, 11 yards, and 11 miles are impractical and unrealistic for a tool that is meant to be handheld. In contrast, 11 inches is a reasonable and common length for paintbrushes, fitting well within the typical range used in painting tasks."

What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two glasses of grape juice are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the glass of grape juice with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question asks which glass of grape juice has a lower temperature. Since both glasses are identical in mass and material, the glass with less thermal energy will naturally have a lower temperature. This is because thermal energy is directly related to temperature; therefore, the glass that holds less thermal energy is at a lower temperature compared to the one with more thermal energy. Thus, the correct choice is the glass with less thermal energy, which corresponds to option 0."

In contrast, option (0) depicts factoids as trivial but true facts, which diverges from the conventional understanding of the term. Therefore, option (1) correctly reflects the traditional sense of ""factoid."""

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two glasses of water have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 40°F glass of water is colder than the 50°F glass of water, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task involves comparing the thermal energy of two identical glasses of water, which differ only in temperature. Thermal energy is directly related to temperature; the higher the temperature, the greater the thermal energy. Since the glass of water at 40°F is colder than the glass at 50°F, it logically contains less thermal energy. Therefore, the correct choice is the glass of water at 40°F, which corresponds to option 1."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The magnets in Pair 1 attract each other, while the magnets in Pair 2 repel each other. However, the key factor affecting the magnitude of the magnetic force is the distance between the magnets. Since there is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 2. Thus, the correct statement is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2."

['a song', 'the Bible']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion turn the other cheek is the Bible.
In the Bible, Jesus counsels his followers to resist retaliation. He says that if they are struck on the right cheek, they shouldn't lash out; instead, they should turn the other cheek toward their attacker.
The allusion turn the other cheek means to respond without aggression."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The phrase ""turn the other cheek"" is an allusion to a teaching found in the Bible, specifically in the Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew. In this context, Jesus encourages his followers to respond to insults and aggression with non-retaliation and forgiveness. The choice of this phrase in the sentence highlights Tyrone's decision to refrain from responding aggressively to Ruth's insult, illustrating a moral or ethical stance rooted in biblical teachings. Thus, the correct source of the allusion is the Bible."

Living things get their food in different ways. A food chain shows how living things in an ecosystem get their food.
Producers make their own food. Many producers use carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight to make sugar. This sugar is food for the producer.
Consumers eat other living things. Consumers cannot make their own food."	In this food chain, the eastern bluebird is a consumer because it eats another living thing. The eastern bluebird in this food chain eats the red-legged grasshopper.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The eastern bluebird is classified as a consumer because it derives its energy and nutrients by consuming other living organisms, specifically the red-legged grasshopper in this food chain. Unlike producers, which create their own food through photosynthesis, consumers rely on other organisms for sustenance. This relationship highlights the role of the eastern bluebird within the ecosystem, where it plays a part in the transfer of energy from one trophic level to another.

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	People are not born knowing how to ride a bicycle. Instead, many people learn how to ride. So, riding a bicycle is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Riding a bicycle is not a skill that individuals are born with; it is something that must be learned through practice and experience. This makes it an acquired trait, as people develop the ability to ride a bike over time rather than inheriting it genetically. Since learning a skill like bicycling involves training and often requires guidance or instruction, it exemplifies how certain abilities are cultivated rather than innate."

The blowfish has sharp spines on its skin. Its skin is adapted to hurt an attacking predator.
The fantastic leaf-tailed gecko has thin skin covering its body. Its skin is not adapted for hurting an attacking predator."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the blowfish because its skin is covered in sharp spines, which serves as a defense mechanism against predators, similar to the porcupine's quills. Both animals have adaptations that can inflict harm on an attacker, making them less appealing targets. In contrast, the fantastic leaf-tailed gecko has thin skin that does not provide any protective features against predators, so it is not well-adapted for defense. Therefore, the blowfish is the more appropriate choice in this context."

Take him years to finish is an exaggeration, since it probably does not take him entire years to fetch coffee."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text employs hyperbole, which is a figure of speech involving exaggerated statements that are not meant to be taken literally. The phrase ""take him years to finish"" clearly exaggerates the actual time it would take to complete a simple task like fetching coffee, emphasizing Dr. Cameron's frustration. It is not an oxymoron, as there is no contradictory pairing of words present in the statement. Thus, the correct choice is hyperbole, represented by the number 0."

Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.

"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 1-kilogram brick at 70°F has half as much thermal energy as a 2-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the smaller brick has half as many atoms. So, it has half as much thermal energy."	The two watermelons are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the colder watermelon has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object; the higher the temperature, the greater the thermal energy it possesses. Since the two watermelons are identical except for their temperatures, the colder watermelon will inherently have less thermal energy compared to the hotter one. This is because thermal energy depends on both the mass and the temperature of the object, and in this case, both watermelons share the same mass but differ in temperature. Thus, the colder watermelon has less thermal energy."

The diagram below shows how a solution can change over time. Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.
As a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.
Membranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal."	"Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.
Before the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 7 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.
When the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 5 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.
So, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the description indicates that before reaching equilibrium, there were more solute particles (7) on the right side compared to the left (3). To balance the concentration, solute particles must have moved from the right side to the left side. Given that there were initially 7 particles on the right and only 3 on the left, it is clear that more solute particles moved to the left than to the right to achieve an equal concentration of 5 particles on each side."

Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Pyrite is a mineral.
A marble is made by humans. But minerals are not made by living things.
So, a marble is not a mineral.
Galena is a mineral."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: A marble is not a mineral because it is a synthetic material created by humans, whereas minerals are naturally occurring substances that are not made by living organisms. Pyrite and galena are both minerals, as they are naturally occurring and not produced by human processes. Therefore, among the given choices, the only substance that does not fit the definition of a mineral is a marble."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The magnetic force between magnets is influenced by the distance separating them; a shorter distance results in a stronger magnetic force. In this case, Pair 2 has a smaller distance between its magnets compared to Pair 1. Therefore, the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2, which makes statement (1) the correct choice. This understanding of the relationship between distance and magnetic force is crucial for accurately assessing the situation presented."

He fills two shopping bags. The shopping bags are the same size and shape.	closed choice	grade2	natural science	physics	Force and motion	How do mass and force affect motion?	"A force is a push or a pull.
A force can make an object start moving or stop an object that is moving. A force can also make an object speed up, slow down, or change direction.
Forces can be different sizes.
Think about trying to move a heavy object and a light object. Imagine you want to move them at the same speed. You will need to use a larger force to move the heavy object."	"Look for the shopping bag that is heavier.
A shopping bag holding 9 pounds of food is heavier than a shopping bag holding 7 pounds of food. So, the bag holding 9 pounds needs a larger force to start moving upward at the same speed as the other bag."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The bag holding 9 pounds of food is heavier than the bag holding 7 pounds of food. Since both bags are lifted at the same speed, the force required to lift an object is directly related to its weight. Therefore, the heavier bag (9 pounds) requires a larger force to be lifted at the same speed compared to the lighter bag (7 pounds). Thus, the correct choice is the bag holding 9 pounds of food."

SOLUTION: The statement suggests that the only valid option is to invite the manager by restating that not inviting her isn't a valid option. This reasoning is circular because it does not provide any external justification for why the manager must be invited; it merely reiterates the conclusion without any additional support. Therefore, the argument exemplifies circular reasoning, as it relies on the claim itself to validate the conclusion."

"Informal writing is typically used in casual situations or when communicating with someone you know well. Informal language often expresses familiarity and tends to sound more like speech. It uses more conversational language, such as slang, idioms, abbreviations, imprecise language, and contractions.
Formal writing is typically used in academic and business writing or when writing directly to an authority figure. It tends to be more courteous and impersonal, avoiding overly familiar or conversational language.
Compare the following sentences.
Informal: Yeah, ostriches can't fly, but I think they're awesome.
More formal: Ostriches may be flightless, but they're remarkable runners.
Most formal: Though flightless, ostriches are remarkable runners."	The first expression of thanks is more formal. It avoids imprecise, conversational language (super nice, fitting me in).	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first expression, ""Thank you for taking the time to speak with me,"" is more formal due to its structured language and polite tone. It conveys respect and appreciation in a professional context, making it suitable for formal interactions. In contrast, the second expression, ""It was super nice talking with you.

A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks."	"Look at the picture of the turkey vulture.
The turkey vulture has a sharp hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to tear through meat. The sharp hook can help the turkey vulture cut the meat into pieces it can swallow.

The California condor has a sharp hooked beak. Its beak is adapted to tear through meat.
The ringed teal has a wide, flat beak. Its beak is not adapted to tear through meat. The ringed teal uses its beak to eat plants and invertebrates that live in mud."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the California condor because, like the turkey vulture, it has a sharp hooked beak that is specifically adapted to tear through meat. This adaptation allows it to efficiently consume carrion, aligning with the scavenging behavior of both birds. In contrast, the ringed teal has a wide, flat beak that is not suited for tearing meat, indicating it primarily feeds on plants and invertebrates.

SOLUTION: The argument presented claims that Emily Campbell's ability to understand rural, blue-collar workers is undermined solely because her husband is an investment banker, which constitutes guilt by association. This fallacy discredits her perspective based on her marital connection rather than her actual qualifications or experiences. The logical flaw lies in assuming that her husband's profession directly impacts her understanding of a different socioeconomic group, which is not necessarily true.

Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have.

For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.

A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur (A). So, Millie's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Millie has agouti fur, which indicates that she possesses at least one dominant allele (A) for the agouti fur trait. The passage states that Millie has two alleles for having agouti fur, meaning both alleles must be A. Therefore, Millie's genotype is AA, confirming she has two dominant alleles for the agouti fur gene. Thus, the correct choice is (1) AA."

David perused the magazine, absentmindedly flipping through the pages.
The nontraditional usage above is now commonly used, but traditional style guides generally advise against it."	"The first text uses travesty in its traditional sense: a ridiculous imitation; a parody.
Kristen was upset about the local news network's coverage of the presidential debates, calling it a travesty of reporting that undermined important issues.
The second text uses travesty in its nontraditional sense: a disappointment or a tragedy.
Kristen thought it a travesty that her local news network provided only limited coverage of the presidential debates.
Most style guides recommend to use the traditional sense of the word travesty because it is considered more standard."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose (1) as the correct answer because it uses ""travesty"" in a context that aligns with its traditional meaning of a serious subject being treated in a ridiculous or inadequate manner, thus emphasizing the gravity of the reporting issues. In this case, Kristen is criticizing the news coverage as a distortion of proper journalism, which fits the definition of a travesty as it highlights the failure to adequately address important issues. In contrast, the first choice uses ""travesty"" more as a general disappointment rather than its traditional sense, which relates to parody or imitation."

It is one of the largest and oldest forests in Europe."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Ecosystems	Describe ecosystems	"An environment includes all of the biotic, or living, and abiotic, or nonliving, things in an area. An ecosystem is created by the relationships that form among the biotic and abiotic parts of an environment.
There are many different types of terrestrial, or land-based, ecosystems. Here are some ways in which terrestrial ecosystems can differ from each other:
the pattern of weather, or climate
the type of soil
the organisms that live there"	A temperate deciduous forest is a type of ecosystem. Temperate deciduous forests have the following features: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. So, the following statements describe the Białowieża Forest ecosystem: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. It has warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters. It has soil that is rich in nutrients. The following statement does not describe the Białowieża Forest: warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters, soil that is rich in nutrients, and only a few types of trees. It has a small amount of rain or snow.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The Białowieża Forest is characterized by a temperate deciduous forest ecosystem, which typically features warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters. This aligns with the second choice provided in the question, indicating that the forest experiences significant seasonal changes in temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, the first choice, which states that it has a small amount of rain or snow, contradicts the nature of a temperate deciduous forest, as these forests typically receive adequate rainfall to support their diverse ecosystems. Thus, the correct statement is that the Białowieża Forest has warm, wet summers and cold, wet winters."

"	"The better estimate for the temperature of the air on a hot day is 38°C.
38°F is too cold."	"ANSWER: 38°C  
SOLUTION: On a hot day, temperatures typically exceed 30°C in many regions, making 38°C a more appropriate estimate for air temperature compared to 38°F. The latter is equivalent to about 3.3°C, which is considered cool rather than hot. Therefore, 38°C is a more realistic representation of what one would expect on a hot day."

['yes', 'no']	1	This diagram shows the life cycle of a fern.	yes or no	grade7	natural science	biology	Plant reproduction	Moss and fern life cycles	"Fern plants reproduce using both asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction.
Mature ferns have flat leaves called fronds. Ferns have structures that look like small dots on the underside of their fronds. These structures are called spore cases. The mature ferns use asexual reproduction to make spores. When the spore cases open, the spores are released.
When a spore lands on the ground and germinates, it grows into a small heart-shaped plant. The heart-shaped plant begins the fern's sexual reproduction stage by making eggs and sperm. Ferns live in damp environments, and sperm can swim though small water drops. Self-fertilization happens when a sperm swims to an egg on the same heart-shaped plant. Cross-fertilization happens when the sperm swims to an egg on a nearby plant.
Fertilization happens when a sperm and an egg fuse. The fertilized egg germinates and grows into a mature fern.
The mature fern can make spores and begin the fern life cycle again."	Ferns do not produce seeds. Mature ferns produce spores, and heart-shaped plants produce eggs and sperm.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Ferns do not produce seeds; instead, they reproduce via spores. The life cycle of a fern involves the production of spores that develop into gametophytes, which then produce eggs and sperm. This process is distinct from seed production, which is characteristic of flowering and cone-bearing plants. Therefore, the correct answer to the question is ""no."""

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when there is a greater distance between the magnets."	"Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The key factor influencing the magnetic force between magnets is the distance separating them. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart compared to those in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 will be weaker. This aligns with the principle that an increase in distance results in a decrease in magnetic force. Therefore, the correct choice is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1."

Ice melting is also a physical change. When ice melts, it changes from a solid to a liquid. But both ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water! This kind of change is called a change of state."	Breaking a pencil is a physical change. The pencil gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""physical change"" because breaking a pencil in half does not alter its chemical composition; the material (graphite and wood) remains the same. The process of breaking simply changes the pencil's shape and size, but the fundamental properties of the matter do not change. In a physical change, the substance retains its original identity, which is true in this case since each piece of the broken pencil is still made of the same materials."

The rock hyrax has short legs. It is not adapted for flight."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The gray-headed albatross is the correct choice because it has long, powerful wings that enable it to fly, which is a clear adaptation for flight. In contrast, the rock hyrax has short legs and lacks the anatomical features necessary for flying. The context provided about the great blue heron further emphasizes the importance of wing structure for flight, aligning with the characteristics of the gray-headed albatross.

	Which meatball has more thermal energy?	['the hotter meatball', 'the colder meatball']	0	Two meatballs are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two meatballs are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter meatball has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The hotter meatball has more thermal energy because thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. Since both meatballs are identical in mass and material, the one with the higher temperature contains more kinetic energy in its particles, resulting in greater thermal energy. Therefore, the choice that indicates the hotter meatball is correct."

"All solids, liquids, and gases are made of matter. Matter is made up of tiny particles that are always moving. The energy from the motion of these particles is called thermal energy.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the particles in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature."	The two blocks of steel have the same mass but different temperatures. Since the 300°F block is colder than the 335°F block, it has less thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The task asks to determine which object has less thermal energy based on their temperatures. Both blocks of steel are identical in mass (9 kilograms) but are at different temperatures: one at 335°F and the other at 300°F. Since thermal energy is directly related to temperature, the block at 300°F has less thermal energy than the block at 335°F, as it is at a lower temperature. Therefore, the correct choice is (1), the 9-kilogram block of steel at a temperature of 300°F."

"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
It has not rained in over a week at Lindsey's house.
This passage tells you about the precipitation last week at Lindsey's house. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage specifically mentions that it has not rained in over a week at Lindsey's house, which refers to a short-term observation of precipitation. This aligns with the definition of weather, as it describes atmospheric conditions at a particular place and time. In contrast, climate refers to long-term patterns and averages of weather.

They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.

In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.

To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of purple particles, look at both the number of purple particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of purple particles per milliliter.
Solution B has more purple particles per milliliter. So, Solution B has a higher concentration of purple particles."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: I chose Solution B because it has a higher number of purple particles per milliliter compared to Solution A. To determine the concentration, one must consider both the quantity of solute (purple particles) and the volume of solvent. Since Solution B has a greater ratio of purple particles relative to its volume, it indicates a higher concentration of the solute. Thus, based on the analysis, Solution B is the correct answer."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.

19 millimeters is too short. 19 meters and 19 kilometers are too long."	"ANSWER: 19

SOLUTION: The best estimate for the length of a potato is 19 centimeters because this measurement is reasonable for the average size of a potato, which typically ranges between 5 to 15 centimeters in length. The option of 19 millimeters is too small, while 19 meters and 19 kilometers are excessively large and unrealistic for a potato. Therefore, 19 centimeters is the most appropriate choice among the options provided."

A pipevine swallowtail butterfly is an insect. Like other insects, a pipevine swallowtail butterfly is an invertebrate. It does not have a backbone. It has an exoskeleton."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the gray tree frog because it is classified as an amphibian, which is a type of vertebrate. Vertebrates are animals that possess a backbone, and amphibians like frogs are included in this category. The other options—grasshopper, pipevine swallowtail butterfly, and leaf-curling spider—are all invertebrates, meaning they lack a backbone.

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The trait of having a scar is considered acquired because it results from external factors, such as injuries or accidents, rather than genetic inheritance. Scars are formed as a response to healing after damage to the skin, which means they are not passed down from parents to children. Since Kyle's scar on his right hand was caused by an event in his life, it is classified as an acquired trait rather than an inherited one."

Notice that each duck spent the same amount of time moving. The duck that moved 755 kilometers moved a shorter distance in that time. So, that duck must have moved at a lower speed."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: To determine which duck was moving at a lower speed, we compare the distances traveled by each duck over the same period of time. The first duck moved 755 kilometers in 10 hours, while the second duck moved 970 kilometers in the same time frame. Since both ducks took the same amount of time, the duck that traveled the shorter distance of 755 kilometers must have been moving at a lower speed, confirming that the answer is option (0)."

The fertilized egg grows into a thin brown stalk on top of the female part. Each stalk has a small spore capsule at the top. Moss plants use asexual reproduction to make small spores in the capsules. When the capsules open, the spores are released.
When the spores land on the ground, they may germinate and grow into a new moss plant. This new moss plant can produce eggs and sperm and begin the moss life cycle again."	"The thin brown stalk produces spores. Spores are released from the capsule at the top of the stalk.
The thin brown stalk does not produce eggs or sperm. They are produced by the female and male parts of the moss plant."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The thin brown stalk of a moss plant specifically produces spores, which are released from the capsule located at its top. This is a crucial part of the moss life cycle, as spores are responsible for the reproduction and dispersal of the plant. In contrast, eggs and sperm are produced by the separate male and female reproductive structures of the moss, not by the stalk itself. Therefore, the correct answer is that the stalk produces spores."

Nick put on an extra pair of socks this morning because it was so cold."	['climate', 'weather']	1		closed choice	grade5	natural science	earth-science	Weather and climate	What's the difference between weather and climate?	"The atmosphere is the layer of air that surrounds Earth. Both weather and climate tell you about the atmosphere.
Weather is what the atmosphere is like at a certain place and time. Weather can change quickly. For example, the temperature outside your house might get higher throughout the day.
Climate is the pattern of weather in a certain place. For example, summer temperatures in New York are usually higher than winter temperatures."	"Read the text carefully.
Nick put on an extra pair of socks this morning because it was so cold.
This passage tells you about the temperature this morning where Nick lives. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage refers to a specific instance of cold temperature experienced by Nick on a particular morning, indicating immediate atmospheric conditions. This is characteristic of weather, which describes short-term variations in the atmosphere. In contrast, climate refers to long-term average conditions over extended periods. Therefore, the description in the passage aligns with the definition of weather."

The sedan needed to be fixed, but it had Bluetooth.', 'After scouring the classified ads for days, Dave finally found a used car that fit his budget. The sedan had Bluetooth, but it needed to be fixed.']	1		closed choice	grade10	language science	writing-strategies	Pronouns	Identify vague pronoun references	"When writing, make sure to avoid vague pronoun references. A vague pronoun reference occurs when a pronoun could refer to more than one possible antecedent.
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, she breathed a sigh of relief.
The pronoun she could refer to either Lisa or Kim, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.
Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.
They say that this nail polish dries in less than five minutes.
The pronoun they is used without its antecedent, so the meaning of the sentence is unclear.

After scouring the classified ads for days, Dave finally found a used car that fit his budget. The sedan needed to be fixed, but it had Bluetooth."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second answer choice contains a vague pronoun reference due to the use of the pronoun ""it,"" which can refer to either the sedan or the Bluetooth feature. This ambiguity makes the sentence unclear, as the reader cannot determine what ""it"" specifically refers to. In contrast, the first answer choice eliminates this ambiguity by clearly stating that the sedan needed to be fixed, making the sentence more precise and easier to understand."

The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
When you are using metric units, length can be written with units of millimeters, centimeters, meters, or kilometers. One meter contains 100 centimeters or 1,000 millimeters. So, 1 meter is larger than 1 centimeter, and 1 centimeter is larger than 1 millimeter.

A red fox is about 1 meter long. The Sydney Harbour Bridge in Australia is about 1,000 meters, or 1 kilometer, in length."	"The best estimate for the length of a leather belt is 60 centimeters.
60 millimeters is too short. 60 meters and 60 kilometers are too long."	"ANSWER: 60 centimeters  
SOLUTION: A leather belt typically ranges from about 80 centimeters to 150 centimeters in length for standard sizes, making 60 centimeters a reasonable estimate as the shortest length one might encounter. The other options, such as 60 millimeters, are too short to be practical for a belt, while 60 meters and 60 kilometers are excessively long and not relevant for this type of accessory. Therefore, 60 centimeters is the most suitable option among the choices provided."

SOLUTION: I chose the plastic bag as the smoother option because it has a flat, non-textured surface that feels sleek and even to the touch. In contrast, a burlap sack is made from coarse fibers that create a rough and bumpy texture, making it less smooth. The tactile experience of handling a plastic bag is typically associated with a smooth sensation, while burlap's natural texture is quite the opposite. Therefore, the plastic bag is definitively smoother than the burlap sack."

['Australia', 'South America', 'Africa']	2		closed choice	grade4	social science	geography	Maps	Use lines of latitude and longitude	"Lines of latitude and lines of longitude are imaginary lines drawn on some globes and maps. They can help you find places on globes and maps.
Lines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0° latitude. We start counting degrees from there.
Lines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.
Lines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0° longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.
The equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180°E and 180°W.
Together, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place."	The prime meridian is the line at 0° longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or South America.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The prime meridian is a longitudinal line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole at 0° longitude. It crosses through several countries, primarily in Africa, including Ghana, Mali, and Algeria. It does not intersect Australia or South America, as those continents are located to the east and west of the prime meridian, respectively.

"	The text argues that Senator Pena hates children, because she wants to cut education funding. However, the fact that Senator Pena wants to cut education funding doesn't necessarily suggest that she hates children. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a straw man.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The text presents a misrepresentation of Senator Pena's position by equating her decision to cut funding with a hatred for children. This oversimplifies her stance and makes it easier to argue against her by attacking a distorted version of her position, which aligns with the straw man fallacy. While guilt by association could also be argued, the main focus is on the misrepresentation of her actions rather than an association with negative connotations. Therefore, the straw man fallacy is the more appropriate choice."
<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=355x307 at 0x31307CFE0>	"Is the following statement about our solar system true or false?
Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	['false', 'true']	0	Use the data to answer the question below.	true-or false	grade8	natural science	earth-science	Astronomy	Analyze data to compare properties of planets	"A planet's volume tells you the size of the planet.
The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
To multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 · 1000
= 1.43 x 10^15 · 10^3
= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)
= 1.43 x 10^18
"	"To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.
Then compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The statement claims that Jupiter's volume is more than 10,000 times that of Mars. To evaluate this, we need the volume of Mars, which is approximately 0.15 x 10^15 km^3. Multiplying this by 10,000 gives us about 1.5 x 10^19 km^3. Since Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, it is significantly less than the calculated figure. Thus, the statement is false."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample B have a higher average speed than the particles in sample A. So, the particles in sample B have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample A.
Because the particles in sample B have the higher average kinetic energy, sample B must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose this answer because the problem indicates that the particles in sample B have a higher average speed compared to those in sample A. Since kinetic energy is directly related to the speed of the particles (as it depends on both mass and the square of the speed), this means that the particles in sample B possess greater average kinetic energy.

When there is a greater distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is smaller.
There is a greater distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The problem states that the magnitude of the magnetic force is affected by the distance between the magnets. Since the magnets in Pair 2 are positioned farther apart compared to those in Pair 1, the magnetic force between the magnets in Pair 2 will be weaker. Thus, the correct choice is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 2.

SOLUTION: To determine which word would be found on the dictionary page with the guide words ""careful"" and ""correct,"" we need to place the options in alphabetical order. The word ""cent"" comes before ""careful"" and would not be found on that page, while ""cube"" comes after ""correct"" and also would not be included. However, since ""cent"" falls alphabetically between ""careful"" and ""correct,"" it is the only option that meets the criteria of being found on that page, making it the correct answer."

Each pink ball represents one particle of solute.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	chemistry	Solutions	Compare concentrations of solutions	"A solution is made up of two or more substances that are completely mixed. In a solution, solute particles are mixed into a solvent. The solute cannot be separated from the solvent by a filter. For example, if you stir a spoonful of salt into a cup of water, the salt will mix into the water to make a saltwater solution. In this case, the salt is the solute. The water is the solvent.
The concentration of a solute in a solution is a measure of the ratio of solute to solvent. Concentration can be described in terms of particles of solute per volume of solvent.
concentration = particles of solute / volume of solvent"	"In Solution A and Solution B, the pink particles represent the solute. To figure out which solution has a higher concentration of pink particles, look at both the number of pink particles and the volume of the solvent in each container.
Use the concentration formula to find the number of pink particles per milliliter.
Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter. So, their concentrations are the same."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The analysis indicates that both Solution A and Solution B have the same number of pink particles per milliliter of solvent, which means their concentrations are identical. By applying the concentration formula, which considers both the number of solute particles and the volume of solvent, it becomes evident that neither solution has a higher concentration of pink particles. Therefore, the correct choice is that their concentrations are the same."
	Select the solid.	['air inside a balloon', 'vinegar', 'scarf', 'air from a hair dryer']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"The air inside a balloon is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air inside a balloon expands to fill all the space in the balloon. If the balloon pops, the air will expand to fill a much larger space.
Vinegar is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you pour vinegar into a different container, the vinegar will take the shape of that container. But the vinegar will still take up the same amount of space.
A scarf is a solid. You can fold a scarf. But it will still have a size and shape of its own.
The air from a hair dryer is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. A hair dryer uses a fan to blow warm air out. When the air leaves the hair dryer, the air expands to fill a much large space."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: A scarf is considered a solid because it has a definite shape and volume, which allows it to be folded or manipulated without losing its form. In contrast, the other options—air inside a balloon, vinegar, and air from a hair dryer—are classified as gases or liquids, which do not maintain a fixed shape. Therefore, among the choices given, the scarf is the only item that qualifies as a solid."

3 millimeters, 3 centimeters, and 3 meters are all too short."	"ANSWER: 3 kilometers  
SOLUTION: A hiking trail typically covers a considerable distance, often several kilometers long, making 3 kilometers the most reasonable choice among the options provided. The other choices, such as 3 millimeters, 3 centimeters, and 3 meters, are significantly shorter and do not accurately represent the length one would expect from a hiking trail.

A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.

"	"An axolotl's scientific name is Ambystoma mexicanum. The first word of its scientific name is Ambystoma.
Lissotriton helveticus is in the genus Lissotriton. The first word of its scientific name is Lissotriton. So, Lissotriton helveticus and Ambystoma mexicanum are not in the same genus.
Ambystoma texanum is in the genus Ambystoma. The first word of its scientific name is Ambystoma. So, Ambystoma texanum and Ambystoma mexicanum are in the same genus.
Taricha torosa is in the genus Taricha. The first word of its scientific name is Taricha. So, Taricha torosa and Ambystoma mexicanum are not in the same genus."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The axolotl, scientifically known as Ambystoma mexicanum, belongs to the genus Ambystoma. Among the choices provided, Ambystoma texanum is also classified under the same genus, making it the correct answer. The other options, Taricha torosa and Lissotriton helveticus, belong to different genera, namely Taricha and Lissotriton, respectively, and therefore do not share the same genus as the axolotl."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are different attract. So, these magnets will attract each other."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The two magnets will attract each other because they are oriented such that the north pole of one magnet is facing the south pole of the other. According to the fundamental properties of magnets, opposite poles attract while like poles repel. Since the closest poles of the two magnets are different, they will pull towards each other, resulting in attraction."

Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the kilometer.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about two objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving faster will go a farther distance in that time. It is moving at a higher speed."	"Look at the distance each mountain biker moved and the time it took to move that distance.
One mountain biker moved 135 kilometers in 5 hours.
The other mountain biker moved 105 kilometers in 5 hours.
Notice that each mountain biker spent the same amount of time moving. The mountain biker who moved 135 kilometers moved a farther distance in that time. So, that mountain biker must have moved at a higher speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine which mountain biker was moving at a higher speed, we can calculate their speeds by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. The first mountain biker traveled 105 kilometers in 5 hours, resulting in a speed of 21 kilometers per hour. The second mountain biker traveled 135 kilometers in the same time, yielding a speed of 27 kilometers per hour. Since 27 kilometers per hour (the speed of the second biker) is greater than 21 kilometers per hour, the second mountain biker was moving at a higher speed."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, but the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The question asks to compare the average kinetic energies of the particles in two gas samples. Since the particles in sample A have a higher average speed than those in sample B, they also possess higher average kinetic energy. Because temperature is directly proportional to the average kinetic energy of particles, sample A, having the higher average kinetic energy, must also have the higher temperature compared to sample B. Thus, the correct choice is that sample A has the higher temperature."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice.
The volume of a planet is a very large quantity. Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.
For example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.
To compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12
If their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:
1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15
"	"To decide which planet is the largest, look at the volumes shown in the table and compare the exponents. Jupiter's volume has an exponent of 15, which is the largest out of all the planets.
Jupiter is made mainly of gas. So, the largest planet is made mainly of gas."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The statement is false because the largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter, which is primarily composed of gas, specifically hydrogen and helium, rather than ice. While some of the outer planets, like Uranus and Neptune, contain significant amounts of ice, they are much smaller than Jupiter. Therefore, the assertion that the largest planet is made mainly of ice is incorrect."

The black bear has arrows pointing to it from the persimmon tree, the swallowtail caterpillar, and the beaver. None of these organisms is a secondary consumer, so the black bear is not a tertiary consumer.
The beaver has an arrow pointing to it from the silver maple. The silver maple is not a secondary consumer, so the beaver is not a tertiary consumer.
The persimmon tree does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the persimmon tree is not a tertiary consumer.

SOLUTION: Dolostone is classified as a rock because it is a naturally occurring solid material composed mainly of the mineral dolomite, and it does not have a fixed crystal structure. Unlike minerals, which have a specific chemical composition and organized atomic structure, dolostone is formed from the accumulation of sediments and is not directly formed from a single mineral. The properties outlined in the hint, such as being light gray and not made by organisms, further support its categorization as a rock rather than a mineral."

In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele B is for a hairy body, and the allele b is for a hairless body.
Chanel, a cat from this group, has a hairless body. Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Chanel's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body. So, Chanel's phenotype for the body hair trait is a hairless body.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Chanel's observable version of the body hair trait is a hairless body, which corresponds to the phenotype described in the choices. The text indicates that Chanel has two alleles for a hairless body, which means her genotype is homozygous recessive (bb). However, the phenotype specifically describes the observable characteristic, which is a hairless body. Therefore, the correct choice for Chanel's phenotype is (0) a hairless body."

Complete the sentence with the word protested. It describes the door as if it were a person who didn't want to obey.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the word ""protested"" because it gives the door a human-like quality, suggesting that it is resisting Tammy's action of pushing it open. This personification implies that the door has feelings or intentions, much like a person who is unwilling to comply with a request. In contrast, ""swung"" simply describes a physical action without attributing any emotional characteristics to the door. Thus, ""protested"" effectively conveys the sense of struggle or reluctance in the interaction."

When an argument or claim introduces irrelevant information or misrepresents the issues at hand, it may be committing a logical fallacy. Logical fallacies can hurt a writer's credibility and can lead readers to draw false conclusions.
A logical fallacy may present irrelevant information:
Fallacy | Description
ad hominem | an attack against the person making the argument, rather than the argument itself
appeal to nature | an argument that assumes the natural choice is always the best choice
bandwagon fallacy | an argument that assumes the popular choice is always the best choice
circular reasoning | an argument that supports a claim with the claim itself

SOLUTION: I chose ""boasted of"" because it attributes human-like qualities to the tomatoes, suggesting they are capable of bragging about their origin. This personification enhances the imagery of the sentence, making the tomatoes seem proud of their vivid color and connection to the farmer's market. In contrast, ""came from"" does not provide any personification and simply states a fact about the tomatoes' origin.

SOLUTION: I chose the black rockfish because there is a clear path in the food web that leads from the black rockfish to the bat star: black rockfish → kelp bass → bat star. In contrast, the orca does not have a pathway leading to the bat star, as the only arrow from the orca points to the sea cucumber, and there are no subsequent connections to the bat star.

Scholars have long debated the exact meaning of the phrase, but many claim that Job is saying that he narrowly escaped death.
The allusion by the skin of his teeth means just barely."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The allusion ""by the skin of his teeth"" originates from the Bible, specifically from the Book of Job. In this context, Job expresses his dire situation and narrow escape from death, which has led to the phrase's meaning of barely managing to escape or survive a difficult situation. Since the phrase is directly linked to a biblical text, the correct choice is (0) the Bible."

The primary composition of a planet is what the planet is made mainly of. In our solar system, planets are made mainly of rock, gas, or ice."	The table tells you that Jupiter is the largest planet and that Jupiter is made mainly of gas. So, the largest planet is made mainly of gas.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The statement is false because the largest planet in our solar system is Jupiter, which is primarily composed of gas, not ice. While there are ice giants like Uranus and Neptune, they are not the largest planets. Therefore, the assertion that the largest planet is made mainly of ice is incorrect, as it is actually made of gas."

Red velvet cupcakes were Krysta's Achilles's heel when she was trying to eat more healthily."	['Greek mythology', 'the Bible']	0		closed choice	grade9	language science	figurative-language	Literary devices	Recall the source of an allusion	"An allusion is a brief mention of something or someone well known, often from mythology, history, or literature. An allusion lets you reference ideas from an entire story in just a few words.
""I'd better get home before I turn into a pumpkin!"" Lila remarked.
Here, Lila alludes to the fairy tale ""Cinderella,"" in which Cinderella must leave the ball before the coach that brought her transforms into a pumpkin. The allusion shows that Lila must depart immediately."	"The source of the allusion Achilles's heel is Greek mythology.
In Greek mythology, Achilles's mother dips him in a river that protects his body wherever it touches. His heel does not get wet, so it is the one part of his body left unprotected. During the Trojan War, an arrow hits Achilles in the heel and kills him.
The allusion Achilles's heel means a sole weakness."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The allusion to ""Achilles's heel"" originates from Greek mythology, where Achilles was a great warrior whose only vulnerability was his heel, leading to his downfall. This term is commonly used to refer to a person's single point of weakness despite their overall strength. In the context of the sentence, Krysta's struggle with red velvet cupcakes represents her weakness in maintaining a healthy diet. Thus, the correct choice is Greek mythology."

A fragile object will break into pieces if you drop it. All four objects are fragile.
You can see clearly through a transparent object. The window and the glass are transparent, but the ceramic tea cup is not.
The property that all four objects have in common is fragile."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The task requires identifying a common property shared by all four objects. Upon analysis, it is clear that all four objects—ceramic tea cup, window, glass, and icicle—are fragile, meaning they can break if dropped. While the ceramic tea cup is opaque and the window and glass are transparent, these properties do not apply to all objects. Thus, the only property that all four objects share is fragility, making option (1) the correct choice."

There are many different units of volume. When you are using customary units, volume may be written in units of fluid ounces, cups, or gallons.
As the diagram shows, there are 8 fluid ounces in 1 cup and 16 cups in 1 gallon. So, 1 fluid ounce is less than 1 cup and much less than 1 gallon.
A glass of milk has a volume of about 8 fluid ounces, or 1 cup. A jug of milk has a volume of 1 gallon."	"The best estimate for the volume of a small can of tomato sauce is 1 cup.
1 fluid ounce is too little and 1 gallon is too much."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: A small can of tomato sauce typically holds about 1 cup, which is equivalent to 8 fluid ounces. The option of 1 fluid ounce is significantly less than what a small can would contain, while 1 gallon is excessively large for a single serving. Therefore, 1 cup is the most accurate and reasonable estimate for the volume of a small can of tomato sauce."

The shape of a bird's beak is one example of an adaptation. Birds' beaks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a sharp hooked beak might help a bird tear through meat easily. A short, thick beak might help a bird break through a seed's hard shell. Birds that eat similar food often have similar beaks."	"Look at the picture of the superb fairywren.
A short, thin beak is light and easy to move. The superb fairywren uses its beak to grab fast-moving insects while flying.
Now look at each bird. Figure out which bird has a similar adaptation.
The European robin has a short, thin beak. Its beak is adapted to catch insects.
The rosy-faced lovebird has a small hooked beak. Its beak is not adapted to catch insects. The rosy-faced lovebird uses its beak to eat seeds and berries."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the European robin (0) because it has a short, thin beak that is well-suited for catching insects, similar to the superb fairywren's beak adaptation. In contrast, the rosy-faced lovebird (1) has a small hooked beak designed for eating seeds and berries, which does not align with the requirement of catching insects.

	Which cup of black tea has a lower temperature?	['the cup of black tea with more thermal energy', 'the cup of black tea with less thermal energy']	1	Two 250-gram cups of black tea are identical except for their thermal energies.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter slow down, the temperature goes down. The matter now has both less thermal energy and a lower temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two cups of black tea are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy has a lower temperature.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The question asks which cup of black tea has a lower temperature, and the key information is that the two cups have different thermal energies but the same mass and material. According to the principles of thermodynamics, temperature is directly related to the thermal energy of a substance; thus, a lower thermal energy correlates to a lower temperature. Therefore, the cup of black tea with less thermal energy (Choice 1) is the one with the lower temperature."

Most past-tense verbs are regular. They end in -ed.
Some verbs are irregular in the past tense. You must remember their past-tense forms.
Future tense verbs tell you about something that is going to happen.
All future-tense verbs use the word will.

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Mr. Cho signed his name on the letter"" uses the past tense, as indicated by the verb ""signed,"" which is the past form of ""sign."" The -ed ending on the verb confirms that the action has already occurred. The context of the sentence suggests that it describes a completed action in the past, reinforcing the identification of the tense."
	Based on this information, what is Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait?	['having horns', 'not having horns']	1	"In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
Zelda is a cow from this group. Zelda has the heterozygous genotype Hh for the horns gene."	closed choice	grade6	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: dominant and recessive	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait.
Some traits, like flower color in pea plants, are controlled by a single gene. Most plants and animals have a genotype made up of two alleles for these traits. These two alleles determine whether an organism is homozygous or heterozygous for the gene.
An organism with two identical alleles for a gene is homozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype FF or ff is homozygous for the flower color gene.
An organism with two different alleles for a gene is heterozygous for that gene. A pea plant with the genotype Ff is heterozygous for the flower color gene.
The types of alleles in an organism's genotype determine the organism's phenotype. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of a trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.
A dominant allele causes its version of the trait to appear even when the organism also has a recessive allele for the gene. In pea plants, the F allele, which causes purple flowers, is dominant over the f allele. A pea plant with at least one F allele will have the F allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype FF or Ff will have purple flowers.
A recessive allele causes its version of the trait to appear only when the organism does not have any dominant alleles for the gene. In pea plants, the f allele, which causes white flowers, is recessive to the F allele. A pea plant with only f alleles will have the f allele's version of the flower color trait. So, a plant with the genotype ff will have white flowers."	"You need to determine Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait. First, consider the alleles in Zelda's genotype for the horns gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Zelda's genotype of Hh has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Zelda's phenotype for the horns trait must be not having horns."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Zelda has a heterozygous genotype of Hh for the horns trait, where H (the allele for not having horns) is dominant over h (the allele for having horns). Since Zelda possesses the dominant allele (H), she will express the dominant phenotype, which means she does not have horns. Therefore, her phenotype for the horns trait is ""not having horns."""

60 kilograms is too heavy."	"ANSWER: 60

SOLUTION: The mass of a typical dinner fork is around 60 grams, which is a reasonable estimate for the weight of common cutlery. In contrast, 60 kilograms is excessively heavy and not a plausible weight for a fork, as it would be more akin to the weight of a small dog or a large object.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces. The stronger the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the strength of a magnetic force between two magnets by changing the distance between them. The magnetic force is weaker when the magnets are farther apart."	"Distance affects the strength of the magnetic force. When magnets are farther apart, the magnetic force between them is weaker.
The magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is weaker in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The analysis of the magnetic force between the pairs of magnets indicates that distance plays a critical role in determining the strength of the magnetic force. Since the magnets in Pair 1 are farther apart than those in Pair 2, the magnetic force in Pair 1 is weaker.

For his report, Ted needs information about zebras."	['exclamatory', 'declarative']	1		closed choice	grade4	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement. It tells about something. A declarative sentence always ends with a period.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
An interrogative sentence is a question. It asks something. An interrogative sentence always ends with a question mark.
How tall are you?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something. An imperative sentence usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.
Read the first chapter by next week.
Look out for that car!
An exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.
Some whales are over ninety feet long!
I can't wait until tomorrow!"	The sentence tells about something, and it ends with a period. It is a declarative sentence.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""For his report, Ted needs information about zebras"" is a declarative sentence because it makes a statement and conveys information. It provides a clear idea about what Ted requires for his report, and it ends with a period, which is a characteristic of declarative sentences. Exclamatory sentences, on the other hand, express strong emotion and typically end with an exclamation mark, which does not apply here. Thus, the correct classification for this sentence is declarative."

The table tells you that of the eight planets, two are made mainly of gas and two are made mainly of ice. So, four of the eight, or half, of the planets are made mainly of gas or ice.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The statement is true because, according to the information provided, there are eight planets in our solar system. Out of these, two are classified as gas giants (Jupiter and Saturn) and two are classified as ice giants (Uranus and Neptune).

	Based on this information, what is Maverick's phenotype for the wool color trait?	['white wool', 'LL']	0	"In a group of sheep, some individuals have white wool and others have black wool. In this group, the gene for the wool color trait has two alleles. The allele L is for white wool, and the allele l is for black wool.
Maverick, a sheep from this group, has white wool. Maverick has two alleles for white wool."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait. Maverick's observable version of the wool color trait is white wool. So, Maverick's phenotype for the wool color trait is white wool.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Maverick's phenotype for the wool color trait is described as white wool, which is the observable version of the trait. The information provided indicates that the allele L corresponds to white wool, and since Maverick has two alleles for white wool, he must have the genotype LL. Therefore, the correct choice representing Maverick's phenotype is (0) white wool."

Platinum is ()."	['an elementary substance', 'a compound']	0	The model below represents platinum. Platinum is a precious metal used to make jewelry.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	chemistry	Atoms and molecules	Classify elementary substances and compounds using models	"There are more than 100 different chemical elements, or types of atoms. Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.
A substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.
Every chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element fluorine is F, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element beryllium is Be.
Scientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a space-filling model. The space-filling model below represents the elementary substance copper.
In a space-filling model, the balls represent atoms that are bonded together. The color of a ball represents a specific chemical element. The atomic symbol for that chemical element is shown in the legend."	"Use the model to determine whether platinum is an elementary substance or a compound.
Step 1: Interpret the model.
In the space-filling model shown above, all of the balls are the same color:
. The legend shows that dark blue represents the chemical element with the atomic symbol Pt. So, the model shows you that platinum is composed of one chemical element.
Step 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.
You know from Step 1 that platinum is composed of only one chemical element. So, platinum is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Platinum is classified as an elementary substance because it is made up entirely of one chemical element, as indicated by the uniformity of the balls in the model. The dark blue color in the model corresponds to the atomic symbol Pt for platinum, confirming that it does not consist of multiple elements or compounds. Therefore, since platinum is not a mixture of different substances but rather a pure element, the correct choice is (0) an elementary substance."

Arms, legs, flippers, and wings are different types of limbs. The type of limbs an animal has is an example of an adaptation. Animals' limbs can be adapted in different ways. For example, long legs might help an animal run fast. Flippers might help an animal swim. Wings might help an animal fly."	"Look at the picture of the harbor seal.
The harbor seal uses its flippers to push itself through water. The flippers can also help it change direction while swimming.

The sea turtle has flippers. Its limbs are adapted for swimming.
The ostrich has short wings and long, thin legs. Its limbs are not adapted for swimming. The ostrich uses its limbs to walk and run on land."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the sea turtle (0) because it has flippers that are specifically adapted for swimming, allowing it to maneuver effectively in the water. The ostrich (1), on the other hand, has limbs that are designed for walking and running on land, with short wings and long legs that are not suitable for swimming. The hint about harbor seals further emphasizes that aquatic animals like sea turtles have adaptations that enhance their ability to swim, which is not the case for ostriches."

Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:
Lisa breathed a sigh of relief when she and Kim finally landed.
A vague pronoun reference also occurs when they, them, their, theirs, it, or its is used without its antecedent.

Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.
There is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The magnets in Pair 2 attract each other, while the magnets in Pair 1 repel each other. However, the direction of the magnetic force does not affect its magnitude. The critical factor in determining the magnitude of the magnetic force is the distance between the magnets; since the magnets in Pair 2 are closer together than those in Pair 1, the magnitude of the magnetic force in Pair 2 is greater."

Atoms can be linked together by chemical bonds. When two or more atoms link together, they form a molecule.
In a chemical change, the chemical bonds in the molecules break. The atoms then link together to form new molecules. The types of molecules in matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Burning a piece of paper is a chemical change. As paper burns, paper molecules react with oxygen molecules in the air. This reaction breaks the chemical bonds in the molecules. The atoms then relink and form different molecules. For example, carbon dioxide molecules are created when paper burns.
In a physical change, chemical bonds do not break. The types of molecules in matter before and after a physical change are always the same.

A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose ""chemical change"" because the browning of a banana involves a reaction with oxygen, resulting in the formation of new substances, such as melanin, which alters the banana's color and composition. This process indicates a transformation at the molecular level, which is a defining characteristic of chemical changes. In contrast, a physical change does not result in new substances being formed; therefore, the browning of the banana fits the definition of a chemical change."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"The particles in both samples have the same average speed, but each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: The average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to their mass and speed. In this case, while both samples have particles moving at the same average speed, the particles in sample A are more massive than those in sample B. Since kinetic energy is calculated as \( KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 \), the higher mass of the particles in sample A results in a greater average kinetic energy. Therefore, sample A has a higher temperature compared to sample B."
	Select the solid.	['air inside a soccer ball', 'water droplets', 'robot', 'helium']	2		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. Air is a gas."	"The air inside a soccer ball is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. The air fills all the space inside the soccer ball. If air leaks out, it will expand into the space around the ball.
Water droplets are a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in. If you collect water droplets in a bucket, they will take the shape of the bucket. But the water droplets will still take up the same amount of space.
A robot is a solid. A solid has a size and shape of its own. A robot can move. But if it moves across a room, the robot will still have a size and shape of its own.
Helium is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space. Helium is lighter than air. So, if you fill a balloon with helium, the balloon will rise. If helium leaks out of the balloon, the helium will expand into the space around the balloon."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The robot is the correct choice as it is a solid, which is defined by having a definite shape and volume. In contrast, air and helium are gases that expand to fill their containers, while water droplets represent a liquid that takes the shape of its container. The robot maintains its size and shape regardless of its movement, clearly categorizing it as a solid."

SOLUTION: The verbal irony in Sadie's statement suggests that she is actually out of shape rather than ready to run a marathon. By declaring her readiness to run a marathon right after collapsing on the couch, she is highlighting the contrast between her words and her physical state. This irony indicates that her experience of exhaustion contradicts her claim, reinforcing the idea that she is far from being in marathon condition.

SOLUTION: The key factor affecting the magnetic force between the magnets is their size. In this scenario, Magnet A remains the same size across both pairs, while Magnet B is smaller in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. Since the magnetic force is inversely related to the size of the magnets (smaller magnets produce a weaker magnetic force), it follows that the magnitude of the magnetic force is indeed smaller in Pair 2 compared to Pair 1.

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.
If the same poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.
"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The question asks whether the magnets will attract or repel each other based on their pole orientation. Since magnets have two poles—north and south—like poles repel while opposite poles attract. In this scenario, the south pole of one magnet is near the south pole of the other magnet, leading to a repulsive interaction between them. Therefore, the correct answer is that the magnets will repel each other."
	"What kind of sentence is this?
That was the most spectacular acrobatic feat I have ever seen!"	['declarative', 'interrogative', 'exclamatory']	2		closed choice	grade9	language science	punctuation	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence declarative, interrogative, imperative, or exclamatory?	"There are four kinds of sentences.
A declarative sentence is a statement and always ends with a period.
The nurse told Mr. Abrams to roll up his sleeve so that she could check his blood pressure.
An imperative sentence makes a request or a demand and usually ends with a period. If a demand shows strong feeling, it can end with an exclamation point.
For this assignment, use references to support your claims.
Don't drive so quickly in the construction zone!
An interrogative sentence asks a question and always ends with a question mark.
Given the recent critiques of her new strategic plan, do you think the CEO will reconsider the company's direction?
An exclamatory sentence is a statement that shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamation always ends with an exclamation point.
I can't wait to travel through Europe this summer!"	The sentence is a statement that shows strong feeling and ends with an exclamation point. It is an exclamatory sentence.	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The sentence expresses a strong emotion or enthusiasm about the acrobatic feat, which is characteristic of exclamatory sentences. It concludes with an exclamation point, further emphasizing the intensity of the speaker's feelings. Unlike declarative sentences that make statements or interrogative sentences that ask questions, this sentence is meant to convey excitement, making it exclamatory in nature."

SOLUTION: The sentence ""Stop twisting the rope like that"" is an imperative sentence because it issues a command or request to someone. Imperative sentences often instruct or direct someone to perform a specific action, and they can end with either a period or an exclamation mark. In this case, the sentence ends with a period, reinforcing its function as a command rather than a question or statement. Therefore, the correct choice is imperative."
	Based on this information, what is Faye's genotype for the albinism gene?	['not having albinism', 'Aa']	1	"This passage describes the albinism trait in rats:

In a group of rats, some individuals have albinism and others do not. In this group, the gene for the albinism trait has two alleles. The allele A is for not having albinism, and the allele a is for having albinism.
Faye, a rat from this group, does not have albinism. Faye has one allele for not having albinism and one allele for having albinism."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Faye has one allele for not having albinism (A) and one allele for having albinism (a). So, Faye's genotype for the albinism gene is Aa.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: Faye's genotype is determined by the combination of alleles she possesses for the albinism gene. Since she does not have albinism, she must have at least one allele for not having albinism, which is represented by A. The passage states that Faye has one allele for not having albinism (A) and one allele for having albinism (a), resulting in the genotype Aa. Therefore, the correct choice is (1) Aa."

Each colored ball represents one gas particle. Both samples have the same number of particles.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Particle motion and energy	Identify how particle motion affects temperature and pressure	"The temperature of a substance depends on the average kinetic energy of the particles in the substance. The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed. So, the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy.
Because the particles in both samples have the same average kinetic energy, the samples must have the same temperature."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The problem states that both samples of gas have the same number of particles and that each particle has the same mass and average speed. Since the average kinetic energy of gas particles is directly related to their speed, and both samples exhibit the same average speed, it follows that their average kinetic energies are also equal. As temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a sample, this means that both samples must have the same temperature."

It has not rained in over a week at Trevor's house.
This passage tells you about the precipitation last week at Trevor's house. It describes the atmosphere at a certain place and time. So, this passage describes the weather."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The passage specifically mentions that it has not rained in over a week, which refers to a short-term atmospheric condition. This indicates a focus on the current state of the atmosphere at Trevor's house rather than long-term trends or averages, which would define climate. Therefore, the passage describes the weather rather than the climate."

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material.	closed choice	grade6	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other."	"The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Both magnet sizes and distance affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. The sizes of the magnets in Pair 1 are the same as in Pair 2. The distance between the magnets is also the same.
So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The analysis shows that the magnets in Pair 1 repel each other while the magnets in Pair 2 attract each other. However, the direction of the magnetic force does not affect its magnitude. Since both pairs of magnets are made of the same material, are of the same size, and are at the same distance from each other, the magnitude of the magnetic force remains unchanged. Therefore, the correct statement is that the magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs."

The average temperatures in January and February are between 30°F and 35°F. These months have the lowest average temperatures of all of the months. So, they are the coldest months of the year.
Choice ""November is warmer than May."" is incorrect.
The average temperature in November is around 50°F. May has an average temperature around 60°F. So, November is colder, not warmer, than May.
Choice ""July, August, and September are colder than the other months of the year."" is incorrect.
The average temperatures in July, August, and September are around 75°F. These months have the highest average temperatures of any months. So, they are hotter, not colder, than the other months."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The statement ""January and February are the coldest months of the year"" is true because the average temperatures in these months range between 30°F and 35°F, making them the lowest compared to other months. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the average temperatures: November is not warmer than May (May is around 60°F), and July, August, and September are indeed the hottest months with averages around 75°F.

However, even though Marie's sister watches reality television, that doesn't necessarily mean that Marie does, too. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as guilt by association.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text presents an argument that tries to discredit Marie's claim of only watching educational programming by associating her with her sister, who watches reality television. This is a classic example of guilt by association, as it implies that because Marie's sister watches a certain type of programming, Marie must as well. The fallacy lies in the assumption that familial or social connections dictate personal choices, which is not logically sound.

It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.

A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	The properties of siltstone match the properties of a rock. So, siltstone is a rock.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Siltstone is classified as a rock because it is composed of fine sediment grains and does not have a fixed crystal structure, which are characteristics typical of rocks. Additionally, it is solid, found in nature, and not a pure substance, further supporting its classification as a rock rather than a mineral. Minerals, on the other hand, are defined by having a specific chemical composition and crystal structure, which siltstone lacks.

The month of July has more days than the month of June.
This is a fact. It can be proved by looking at a calendar and counting the number of days in each month.
An opinion is something that a person believes, thinks, or feels. An opinion cannot be proved true.
July is a better month than June for camping.
This is an opinion. People may have different opinions about which month is ""better"" for camping."	"The second sentence states a fact.
In ancient Egypt, some people were preserved as mummies after they died.

The first sentence states an opinion.
Preserving dead people as mummies is definitely gross.
Definitely gross shows what a person believes, thinks, or feels. Another person might have a different opinion about what is gross."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The second sentence is a factual statement that can be verified through historical evidence, specifically regarding the practice of mummification in ancient Egypt. It describes an actual event that occurred in history, making it objective. In contrast, the first sentence expresses a personal opinion about mummification being ""gross,"" which is subjective and can vary from person to person.

The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes and shapes.	closed choice	grade7	natural science	physics	Velocity, acceleration, and forces	Compare magnitudes of magnetic forces	"Magnets can pull or push on each other without touching. When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart. These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.
The strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.
You can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when the magnets are larger."	"Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The analysis of the magnets indicates that the size of the magnets influences the strength of the magnetic force they exert on each other. Since Magnet A remains the same size in both pairs, the determining factor is the size of Magnet B. In Pair 1, Magnet B is larger than in Pair 2. Therefore, the larger Magnet B in Pair 1 results in a greater magnetic force compared to Pair 2, where Magnet B is smaller. This leads to the conclusion that the magnitude of the magnetic force is indeed greater in Pair 1."

Inherited traits are passed down through families. Children gain these traits from their parents. Inherited traits do not need to be learned.
Acquired traits are gained during a person's life. Some acquired traits, such as riding a bicycle, are gained by learning. Other acquired traits, such as scars, are caused by the environment. Children do not inherit their parents' acquired traits."	Children do not inherit their parent's scars. Instead, scars are caused by the environment. People can get scars after they get hurt. So, having a scar is an acquired trait.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The scar on Sam's right knee is an acquired trait because it results from an injury or environmental factor rather than genetic inheritance. Scars form as a response to wounds, and they are not passed down from parents to children. Therefore, this characteristic is not inherited but rather developed through personal experiences or incidents."

"	The text argues that raw milk is better than pasteurized milk because pasteurization isn't a natural process. However, raw milk isn't necessarily healthier for humans just because it's unprocessed. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as an appeal to nature.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The text suggests that raw milk is superior to pasteurized milk because pasteurization is a human-made process, implying that natural processes are inherently better. This reasoning falls under the appeal to nature fallacy, which assumes that what is natural is automatically good or preferable. The argument overlooks the potential health risks associated with consuming raw milk, demonstrating that the belief in the superiority of natural products is not always justified."

	How long is an adult alligator?	['14 feet', '14 inches']	0	Select the better estimate.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	units-and-measurement	Units and measurement	Choose customary units of distance	"Measurements are written with both a number and a unit. The unit comes after the number. The unit shows what the number means.
Imagine being told that a pencil is 8 long. You might be thinking, 8 what? Is the pencil 8 inches long? 8 feet? 8 miles?
The number 8 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are inches. So, the length of the pencil is 8 inches.
There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So, 1 inch is much shorter than 1 foot.
There are 3 feet in 1 yard. So, 1 foot is shorter than 1 yard."	"The better estimate for the length of an adult alligator is 14 feet.
14 inches is too short."	"ANSWER: 14 feet  
SOLUTION: Adult alligators typically reach lengths between 10 to 15 feet, with some individuals even exceeding 15 feet. Therefore, 14 feet is a reasonable estimate for the length of an adult alligator. In contrast, 14 inches is not a plausible size for an adult alligator, as it is significantly shorter than even the juvenile stage. Hence, 14 feet is clearly the better and more accurate choice."

Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A bobcat's scientific name is Lynx rufus. The first word of its scientific name is Lynx.
Halichoeres hortulanus is in the genus Halichoeres. The first word of its scientific name is Halichoeres. So, Halichoeres hortulanus and Lynx rufus are not in the same genus.

In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
Cutting a piece of paper is a physical change. The cut pieces are still made of paper.
A change of state is a type of physical change. For example, ice melting is a physical change. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water."	Breaking a ceramic plate is a physical change. The plate gets broken into pieces. But each piece is still made of the same type of matter.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Breaking a ceramic plate is classified as a physical change because it involves a change in the form or appearance of the material without altering its chemical composition. The broken pieces still retain the same properties as the original plate, meaning they are still made of the same material. In contrast, a chemical change would involve a transformation that alters the substance's chemical structure, resulting in new substances being formed.

A green frog is an amphibian. Like other amphibians, a green frog has a backbone."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The green frog, being an amphibian, is part of a group of animals that possess a backbone, which classifies it as a vertebrate. In contrast, the ladybug is an insect and does not have a backbone, as insects belong to the invertebrate category. Therefore, the correct choice for the animal with a backbone is the green frog, making option (0) the accurate answer."

SOLUTION: I chose steel as the substance that is not a rock because it is a man-made material, produced through human processes, unlike natural rocks. Conglomerate and marble are both classified as rocks, as they occur naturally and are composed of mineral materials. Steel, being a synthetic alloy primarily made from iron and carbon, does not fit the definition of a rock, which is typically a naturally occurring solid aggregate of minerals.

Look closely at the last three properties:
A mineral is not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories cannot be minerals.
A mineral is a pure substance.

This means that the atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
"	Hematite has all the properties of a mineral. So, hematite is a mineral.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Hematite is indeed classified as a mineral because it possesses all the essential characteristics that define a mineral. It has a fixed crystal structure and is a solid substance, which are fundamental criteria. Additionally, hematite is naturally occurring, not made by organisms, and is considered a pure substance. Therefore, based on these properties, the answer is ""yes,"" indicating that hematite is a mineral."

SOLUTION: I chose Solution B because it has more purple particles per milliliter compared to Solution A. By applying the concentration formula, which calculates the ratio of solute (purple particles) to the volume of solvent, Solution B demonstrates a higher density of purple particles. The analysis of the diagram confirms that Solution B contains a greater number of purple particles relative to its volume, leading to the conclusion that it has a higher concentration."

Each breakdown is as enjoyable as a punch to the face."	"The text uses verbal irony, which involves saying one thing but implying something very different.
Someone had better turn on the heat ironically suggests that the temperature was too warm. Sasha did not think that more heat was needed; she was already sweating."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The verbal irony in the text is evident as Sasha's statement about needing to turn on the heat contrasts sharply with the physical evidence of her sweating. This implies that the temperature is actually too warm, not cool, which is the opposite of what her words suggest. By saying someone should turn on the heat while sweating, Sasha conveys that the environment is uncomfortably hot, highlighting the ironic nature of her comment. Thus, the correct interpretation is that the temperature was too warm."

Hansen was a chef's assistant in an Italian restaurant. One of his coworkers told him that adding salt to water would cause the spaghetti to cook faster.
Hansen gathered six pots that were the same size. He filled each pot with the same amount of pure water. He added one tablespoon of salt to each of three pots. He did not add salt to the other three pots. Then, Hansen boiled spaghetti in each pot. He checked how firm the spaghetti was after five minutes of boiling.
Figure: spaghetti in a pot."	closed choice	grade7	natural science	science-and-engineering-practices	Designing experiments	Identify control and experimental groups	"Experiments have variables, or parts that change. You can design an experiment to investigate whether changing a variable between different groups has a specific outcome.
For example, imagine you want to find out whether adding fertilizer to soil affects the height of pea plants. You could investigate this question with the following experiment:
You grow one group of pea plants in soil with fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. This group shows you what happens when fertilizer is added to soil. Since fertilizer is the variable whose effect you are investigating, this group is an experimental group.
You grow another group of pea plants in soil without fertilizer and measure the height of the plants. Since this group shows you what happens when fertilizer is not added to the soil, it is a control group.
By comparing the results from the experimental group to the results from the control group, you can conclude whether adding fertilizer to the soil affects pea plant height."	In this experiment, Hansen investigated whether adding salt to water affects how quickly spaghetti cooks. The pots with pure water did not have salt. So, they were part of a control group.	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: In the described experiment, Hansen used six pots, three of which had salt added and three that did not. The pots without salt (pure water) serve as the control group because they provide a baseline for comparison to evaluate the effect of salt on cooking time. The control group helps determine how the spaghetti behaves in a standard condition, allowing Hansen to assess the impact of salt accurately. Therefore, the pots with pure water are categorized as the control group, which is why the answer is 0."

Figure: spectacled cobra."	closed choice	grade5	natural science	biology	Adaptations	Animal adaptations: beaks, mouths, and necks	"An adaptation is an inherited trait that helps an organism survive or reproduce. Adaptations can include both body parts and behaviors.
The shape of an animal's neck is one example of an adaptation. Animals' necks can be adapted in different ways. For example, a large frilled neck might help an animal appear dangerous to its predators. A long neck might help an animal get food from tall trees."	"Look at the picture of the spectacled cobra.
When frightened, the spectacled cobra can spread out its hood to appear larger and more dangerous. If a predator is nearby, the hood can help scare it away.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The frillneck lizard has a layer of skin, called a frill,  around its neck. It uses its neck to appear larger and more dangerous to a predator.
The sand lizard has a short neck. Its neck is not adapted to help it appear larger and more dangerous to a predator."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose the frillneck lizard because it has a unique adaptation that allows it to expand the frill around its neck, making it appear larger and more intimidating to potential predators. This behavior is similar to how the spectacled cobra uses its hood to achieve the same effect. In contrast, the sand lizard has a short neck and lacks this adaptation, making it unsuitable for the task of appearing larger and more threatening to predators. Therefore, the frillneck lizard is the correct choice."

So, Alouatta caraya is the scientific name."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The scientific name of an organism follows the binomial nomenclature system, which consists of two parts: the genus name and the species name. In this case, ""Alouatta"" is the genus and ""caraya"" is the species. The hint specifies that the organism is a black howler, which corresponds to the scientific name ""Alouatta caraya.""

A declarative sentence is a statement. It tells about something. A declarative sentence always ends with a period.
I have an older brother and a younger sister.
An interrogative sentence is a question. It asks something. An interrogative sentence always ends with a question mark.
How tall are you?
An imperative sentence is a command. It makes a request or tells someone to do something. An imperative sentence usually ends with a period. If the command shows strong feeling, it ends with an exclamation point.

An exclamatory sentence is like a statement, but it shows surprise or strong feeling. An exclamatory sentence always ends with an exclamation point.
Some whales are over ninety feet long!
I can't wait until tomorrow!"	The sentence asks something, and it ends with a question mark. It is an interrogative sentence.	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: The sentence ""Who took the wheelbarrow out of the shed?"" is constructed to seek information, which is a defining characteristic of interrogative sentences. It begins with a question word ""Who"" and ends with a question mark, further indicating that it is posing a query. In contrast, declarative sentences provide statements or facts without seeking a response. Therefore, the correct classification of this sentence is interrogative."

['a motorboat that moved 110miles west in 10hours', 'a motorboat that moved 55miles west in 10hours', 'a motorboat that moved 165miles north in 10hours']	1		closed choice	grade3	natural science	physics	Force and motion	Compare the speeds of moving objects	"An object's speed tells you how fast the object is moving. Speed depends on both distance and time.
Distance tells you how far the object has moved. One unit used to measure distance is the mile.
Time tells you how long the object has spent moving. One unit used to measure time is the hour.
Think about objects moving for the same amount of time. The object that is moving the slowest will go the shortest distance in that time. It is moving at the lowest speed."	"Look at the distance each motorboat moved and the time it took to move that distance. The direction each motorboat moved does not affect its speed.
Notice that each motorboat moved for 10 hours. The motorboat that moved 55 miles moved the shortest distance in that time. So, that motorboat must have moved at the lowest speed."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: To determine the speed of each motorboat, we calculate their speeds by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. For the first motorboat, the speed is 110 miles / 10 hours = 11 miles per hour. The second motorboat's speed is 55 miles / 10 hours = 5.5 miles per hour. The third motorboat's speed is 165 miles / 10 hours = 16.5 miles per hour. Since the second motorboat has the lowest speed of 5.5 miles per hour, it is the one that moved at the lowest speed."

Some solids can be bent or broken easily. Others are hard to bend or break.
A glass cup is a solid. A sock is also a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it takes the shape of its container.

If you hit a baseball with a bat, the baseball will still have a size and shape of its own."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: A baseball is classified as a solid because it maintains a definite shape and volume. Unlike liquids, which take the shape of their container and can flow, a baseball retains its form regardless of external forces applied to it, such as being hit with a bat. Additionally, solids have particles that are closely packed together, which contributes to their rigidity and stability, further confirming that a baseball is indeed a solid."

He wants dinner to be as tasty as possible. But he is also hungry and wants to eat soon.	closed choice	grade4	social science	economics	Basic economic principles	Costs and benefits	"Before you decide to do something, it is often helpful to list costs and benefits.
Costs are what you give up or spend when you decide to do something. Costs involve giving up things that you want or need.
Benefits are what you gain or save when you decide to do something. Benefits involve gaining something that you want or need."	"This result is a cost. It involves giving up or spending something that Dan wants or needs:
Dan will spend more time making the beef barley soup than he would have spent making the split pea soup."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose this answer because it highlights the trade-off Dan faces when deciding to make beef barley soup instead of split pea soup. The time spent making the beef barley soup represents an opportunity cost, as he could have used that time to make the other soup and potentially eat sooner. While the tastiness of the beef barley soup may be a positive outcome, the increased time commitment is a clear cost associated with his decision."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
cutting an apple
shaking up salad dressing"	['Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	3		closed choice	grade3	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
Cutting an apple is a physical change. The apple gets a different shape. But it is still made of the same type of matter as the uncut apple.
Shaking up salad dressing is a physical change. The different parts mix together, but they are still made of the same type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 3  
SOLUTION: Both cutting an apple and shaking up salad dressing are examples of physical changes. In both cases, the matter involved does not change its chemical composition; cutting an apple changes its shape, while shaking salad dressing mixes its components without altering them chemically. Therefore, the correct choice is that both changes are only physical changes. The other options regarding chemical changes or being caused by heating/cooling do not apply to these actions."

The words tip and lake don't rhyme. They end with different sounds."	"The words top and cop rhyme. They both end with the op sound.
The word mad does not rhyme. It ends with a different sound."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The word ""mad"" does not rhyme with ""cop"" and ""top"" because it has a different ending sound. ""Cop"" and ""top"" both end with the ""op"" sound, making them rhyme with each other. In contrast, ""mad"" ends with the ""ad"" sound, which is distinct from the ""op"" sound. Therefore, ""mad"" is the word that does not rhyme with the others."

['New Mexico', 'Nevada', 'Kansas', 'Wyoming']	2		closed choice	grade2	social science	geography	Geography	Read a map: cardinal directions	"Maps have four cardinal directions, or main directions. Those directions are north, south, east, and west.
A compass rose is a set of arrows that point to the cardinal directions. A compass rose usually shows only the first letter of each cardinal direction.
The north arrow points to the North Pole. On most maps, north is at the top of the map."	To find the answer, look at the compass rose. Look at which way the east arrow is pointing. Kansas is farthest east.	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: To determine which state is farthest east among the options provided, we can examine their longitudinal positions. Kansas has a more eastern longitude compared to New Mexico, Nevada, and Wyoming. While New Mexico is located to the south and has a more westerly position, both Nevada and Wyoming are situated further west than Kansas.

A good is something you can touch or hold in your hands. For example, a hammer is a good.
A service is a job you pay someone else to do. For example, cooking food in a restaurant is a service."	"To decide whether flying a plane is a good or a service, ask these questions:
Is flying a plane something you can touch? No.
Is flying a plane a job you might pay someone else to do? Yes.
So, flying a plane is a service."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Flying a plane is classified as a service because it involves an action performed by a pilot for the benefit of passengers or cargo transportation, rather than a tangible product that can be touched or owned. Services are characterized by their intangibility, meaning they cannot be stored or owned like physical goods. In this case, when someone pays for a flight, they are paying for the experience and expertise of the pilot, which further supports the classification of flying a plane as a service."

The higher the average kinetic energy of the particles, the higher the temperature of the substance.
The kinetic energy of a particle is determined by its mass and speed. For a pure substance, the greater the mass of each particle in the substance and the higher the average speed of the particles, the higher their average kinetic energy."	"Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.
Because the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: I chose option (1) sample A because the particles in sample A not only have more mass but also possess a higher average speed compared to the particles in sample B. Kinetic energy is directly related to both mass and the square of the speed of the particles. Given that the average kinetic energy of the particles in sample A is higher, it follows that sample A has a higher temperature than sample B."

SOLUTION: The task requires identifying a common property among three objects. Upon evaluating the choices, ""rough"" is the only property that applies to all three objects—sidewalk, pineapple, and tree bark—since they all have a scratchy texture. In contrast, the other options, ""bouncy"" and ""fuzzy,"" do not apply to all three objects, as the pineapple and tree bark do not bounce, and the sidewalk is not fuzzy.

The number 7 on its own does not give you much information about when the bus is leaving. That is because the units are missing.
Time is usually measured in units of seconds, minutes, or hours. It takes about 1 second to sneeze and 1 minute to get dressed in the morning. It takes about 1 hour to bake a pie in the oven.
There are 60 seconds in 1 minute. So, 1 second is much less than 1 minute.
There are 60 minutes in 1 hour. So, 1 minute is much less than 1 hour."	"The better estimate for how long it takes to watch a movie at the theater is 3 hours.
3 minutes is too fast."	"ANSWER: 3

SOLUTION: The typical length of a movie at the theater ranges from about 90 minutes to over 3 hours, depending on the film. Given that the options are 3 hours and 3 minutes, 3 hours is a more realistic estimate for the duration of most movies. 3 minutes is far too short to represent the time it takes to watch a movie, making it an impractical choice. Therefore, the better estimate is 3 hours."

Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A cocoi heron's scientific name is Ardea cocoi.
Tyto alba does not have the same scientific name as a cocoi heron. So, Ardea cocoi and Tyto alba are not in the same species.
Ardea cocoi has the same scientific name as a cocoi heron. So, these organisms are in the same species.
Falco peregrinus does not have the same scientific name as a cocoi heron. So, Ardea cocoi and Falco peregrinus are not in the same species."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: The organism in the same species as the cocoi heron is Ardea cocoi, which is the scientific name for the cocoi heron itself. The other two options, Falco peregrinus and Tyto alba, are different species altogether, as their scientific names do not match that of the cocoi heron. Therefore, only Ardea cocoi shares the same species designation as the cocoi heron, making it the correct choice."

Vague pronoun references can be corrected in one of two ways:
1. Replace the pronoun with its correct antecedent:
When Lisa and Kim finally landed, Lisa breathed a sigh of relief.
2. Rewrite the sentence:

The first answer choice shows a possible correction for the vague pronoun reference. It has been replaced with the broken glass.
Carly used an old broom to clean up the broken glass before throwing the broken glass away."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: I chose answer choice (1) because it contains a vague pronoun reference with the word ""it,"" which could refer to either the old broom or the broken glass. This ambiguity makes it unclear what is being thrown away. In contrast, answer choice (0) clarifies the reference by explicitly stating ""the broken glass,"" eliminating any potential confusion about what is being discarded.

In contrast, option (0) describes red-headed poison frogs, which are amphibians and do not meet the criteria for placental mammals as they lay eggs and have moist skin without fur. Therefore, the only animal that fits all the characteristics of placental mammals is the sea otter."

The shape of an animal's feet is one example of an adaptation. Animals' feet can be adapted in different ways. For example, webbed feet might help an animal swim. Feet with thick fur might help an animal walk on cold, snowy ground."	"Look at the picture of the bald eagle.
The bald eagle has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey. The sharp claws can help the bald eagle attack and kill its prey. The long toes can help it hold on to its prey.
Now look at each animal. Figure out which animal has a similar adaptation.
The common buzzard has long toes with sharp claws. Its feet are adapted for grabbing prey.
The sable has hoofed feet. Its feet are not adapted for grabbing prey. The sable uses its feet to walk and run on hard ground."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the common buzzard because it has long toes with sharp claws, which are specifically adapted for grabbing prey, similar to the bald eagle. The sable, on the other hand, has hoofed feet that are not suitable for grasping or capturing prey, as they are designed for walking and running on solid ground. Therefore, the common buzzard is the correct choice when considering which animal's feet are adapted for this purpose."
	"What do these two changes have in common?
a slice of banana turning brown
a copper statue turning green"	['Both are caused by cooling.', 'Both are caused by heating.', 'Both are chemical changes.', 'Both are only physical changes.']	2		closed choice	grade4	natural science	chemistry	Physical and chemical change	Compare physical and chemical changes	"Chemical changes and physical changes are two common ways matter can change.
In a chemical change, the type of matter changes. The types of matter before and after a chemical change are always different.
Some chemical changes are caused by heating or cooling. For example, burning a piece of paper is a chemical change caused by heating. When paper gets hot enough, it re­acts with oxygen in the air and burns. The paper and oxygen change into ash and smoke.
In a physical change, the type of matter stays the same. The types of matter before and after a physical change are always the same.
A change of state is a type of physical change. Changes of state can be caused by heating or cooling. For example, ice melting is a physical change that can be caused by heating. Ice and liquid water are made of the same type of matter: water.
The law of conservation of mass says that all physical and chemical changes conserve mass. Conserve means to keep the same. So, the total mass before a physical or chemical change is equal to the total mass after the change."	"Step 1: Think about each change.
A slice of banana turning brown is a chemical change. The part of the banana in contact with the air reacts with oxygen and turns into a different type of matter.
A copper statue turning green is a chemical change. The copper reacts with oxygen in the air. This reaction forms a different type of matter called copper oxide. The copper oxide is green.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."	"ANSWER: 2  
SOLUTION: Both changes involve a transformation in the chemical composition of the substances involved. The browning of a banana occurs due to a reaction with oxygen, leading to the formation of new compounds, which is a chemical change. Similarly, the green patina on a copper statue results from a chemical reaction between copper and oxygen, forming copper oxide. Therefore, both changes are classified as chemical changes, making option 2 the correct choice."

	Which cotton ball has more thermal energy?	['the hotter cotton ball', 'the colder cotton ball']	0	Two cotton balls are identical except for their temperatures.	closed choice	grade5	natural science	physics	Heat and thermal energy	How are temperature and mass related to thermal energy?	"Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms. Atoms are always moving.
The energy of moving atoms is called thermal energy. The total amount of thermal energy in matter depends on three things: the type of matter, the amount of matter, and how fast the atoms are moving.
Temperature measures how hot or cold matter is. If the atoms in matter move faster, the temperature goes up. The matter now has both more thermal energy and a higher temperature.
What happens if the amount of matter changes? A 2-kilogram brick at 70°F has twice as much thermal energy as a 1-kilogram brick at 70°F. The two bricks have the same temperature, but the larger brick has twice as many atoms. So, it has twice as much thermal energy."	The two cotton balls are made of the same material and have the same mass. So, the hotter cotton ball has more thermal energy.	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: Thermal energy is directly related to the temperature of an object. In this case, since both cotton balls are identical in material and mass, the one with the higher temperature (the hotter cotton ball) will possess more thermal energy. This is because thermal energy increases with temperature, meaning the particles in the hotter cotton ball have more kinetic energy compared to those in the colder cotton ball. Thus, the hotter cotton ball has more thermal energy."

When magnets attract, they pull together. When magnets repel, they push apart.
Whether a magnet attracts or repels other magnets depends on the positions of its poles, or ends. Every magnet has two poles, called north and south.
Here are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is marked N, and the south pole is marked S.
If different poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.

"	"Will these magnets attract or repel? To find out, look at which poles are closest to each other.
The south pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Poles that are the same repel. So, these magnets will repel each other."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The magnets will repel each other because they are positioned with like poles facing each other; specifically, the south pole of one magnet is near the south pole of the other. According to the principles of magnetism, like poles repel while opposite poles attract. Since both magnets have the same pole (south) aligned, they will push apart from each other instead of pulling together."

Nico, a cat from this group, has a hairy body. Nico has one allele for a hairy body and one allele for a hairless body."	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Genes to traits	Genetics vocabulary: genotype and phenotype	"All organisms have pieces of hereditary material called genes, which are passed from parents to offspring. Genes contain instructions for building the parts of an organism. An organism's genes affect its observable traits, including its appearance, its behavior, and which diseases it may have. Genes may have different alleles, or forms, that can cause different versions of a trait.
For example, flower color is a trait in pea plants. The gene for this trait has two possible alleles. Each allele is represented by an uppercase or lowercase letter. The allele F is for purple flowers, and the allele f is for white flowers. Each pea plant has two alleles for the flower color gene—one allele inherited from each parent.
An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. So, a pea plant may have a genotype of FF, Ff, or ff for the flower color gene.
An organism's phenotype for a trait is its observable version of that trait, which depends on the organism's combination of alleles. A pea plant may have a phenotype of purple flowers or white flowers for the flower color trait."	An organism's genotype for a gene is its combination of alleles for that gene. Nico has one allele for a hairy body (B) and one allele for a hairless body (b). So, Nico's genotype for the body hair gene is Bb.	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: Nico's genotype for the body hair gene is determined by the alleles he possesses. Since he has a hairy body, this indicates that he carries at least one allele for the hairy trait, which is represented by 'B'. Additionally, it is specified that he has one allele for a hairy body and one for a hairless body, which means his genotype must be Bb, where 'B' is for the hairy trait and 'b' is for the hairless trait. Thus, the correct choice that represents Nico's genotype is (1) Bb."

A cart holding 82 pounds is heavier than a cart holding 59 pounds. So, the cart holding 82 pounds needs a larger force to start moving at the same speed as the other cart."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: I chose the cart holding 82 pounds because it is heavier than the cart holding 59 pounds. Since both donkeys pull the carts at the same speed, the heavier cart requires a larger force to overcome its greater weight. Therefore, more force must be exerted to maintain that same speed for the cart holding 82 pounds compared to the lighter cart."

A rock can be made of one or more minerals.
Minerals and rocks have the following properties:
Property | Mineral | Rock
It is a solid. | Yes | Yes
It is formed in nature. | Yes | Yes
It is not made by organisms. | Yes | Yes
It is a pure substance. | Yes | No
It has a fixed crystal structure. | Yes | No
You can use these properties to tell whether a substance is a mineral, a rock, or neither.
Look closely at the last three properties:
Minerals and rocks are not made by organisms.
Organisms make their own body parts. For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be  minerals or rocks.
Humans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.
A mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.
A pure substance is made of only one type of matter.  Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.
A mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.
The crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.
However, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure. So, the arrangement of atoms or molecules in different pieces of the same type of rock may be different!"	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of minerals. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of minerals.
Gypsum is a mineral.
An antler is not a pure substance. But all minerals are pure substances.
So, an antler is not a mineral.

SOLUTION: An antler is not a mineral because it is not a pure substance; it is made of organic material, specifically keratin, and is formed by living organisms (deer, in this case). In contrast, baryte and gypsum are both minerals as they are naturally occurring, inorganic solid substances with a definite chemical composition and crystalline structure.

SOLUTION: The first choice, ""Beavers build a dam, they use sticks and branches,"" is a run-on sentence because it improperly combines two independent clauses with just a comma, lacking a coordinating conjunction. In contrast, the second choice, ""Our cabin has bunk beds for the kids,"" is a complete sentence with a clear subject and predicate, therefore it is not a run-on sentence.

1 pound and 1 ton are both too heavy."	"ANSWER: 0

SOLUTION: The mass of an eraser is best estimated at 1 ounce, as this weight is typical for small stationery items. Choosing 1 pound or 1 ton would be excessively heavy for an object of that size, making them unrealistic options. An eraser is generally lightweight and easily portable, which aligns with the 1-ounce estimate. Thus, 1 ounce is the most accurate choice given the context of the question."

Imagine being told that a pencil is 16 long. You might be thinking, 16 what? Is the pencil 16 centimeters long? 16 meters? 16 kilometers?
The number 16 on its own does not give you much information about the length of the pencil. That is because the units are missing.
Now look at the drawing of the pencil and the ruler. The ruler shows that the units are centimeters. So, the length of the pencil is 16 centimeters.
There are 100 centimeters in 1 meter. So, 1 centimeter is much shorter than 1 meter.
There are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer. So, 1 meter is much shorter than 1 kilometer."	"The better estimate for the length of a hummingbird's beak is 2 centimeters.
2 kilometers is too long."	"ANSWER: 2

SOLUTION: The beak of a hummingbird typically ranges from about 2 to 10 centimeters in length, depending on the species. Thus, 2 centimeters is a more reasonable estimate for the length of a hummingbird's beak compared to 2 kilometers, which is an impractically long measurement for such a small bird. The choice of 2 centimeters aligns with common knowledge about the size of hummingbirds and their anatomy. Therefore, it is the correct and logical answer."

Every chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, the symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, the symbol is one capital letter and one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element fluorine is F, and the symbol for the element beryllium is Be.
The symbol for each element in a substance is shown in the substance's chemical formula.
An elementary substance is represented by a chemical formula that contains only one symbol.

For example, the chemical formula for the elementary substance oxygen is O2. The formula has a subscript of 2. This subscript tells you that there are two atoms in the molecule represented by this chemical formula.
The chemical element represented by the symbol O is also called oxygen. So, the formula O2 tells you that each molecule of O2 contains two oxygen atoms.
A compound is represented by a chemical formula that contains multiple symbols.
For example, in the compound beryllium fluoride, there is one beryllium atom for every two fluorine atoms. This combination is shown in the compound's chemical formula, BeF2.

The chemical formula for zinc is Zn. This formula contains one symbol: Zn. So, the formula tells you that zinc is made of one chemical element.
Substances made of only one chemical element are elementary substances. So, zinc is an elementary substance."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Zinc is classified as an elementary substance because its chemical formula, Zn, consists of only one symbol representing a single chemical element. Unlike compounds, which are made up of two or more different elements, zinc stands alone as a pure element. Therefore, it does not combine with other substances in its basic form, affirming that it is an elementary substance rather than a compound."
	What can a fertilized egg become?	['a cone', 'a seed', 'pollen']	1		closed choice	grade4	natural science	biology	Plants	Describe and construct conifer life cycles	"Conifers are plants that grow cones. Conifers use their cones to reproduce, or make new plants like themselves. How do conifers use their cones to reproduce?
Conifers can grow male and female cones. Male cones make pollen, and female cones make eggs. Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
The seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant."	"Fertilized eggs grow into seeds.
A seed can grow into a new plant, which can grow pollen and cones. But a fertilized egg does not become pollen or a cone."	"ANSWER: 1

SOLUTION: A fertilized egg develops into a seed, which is the reproductive structure of many plants. While seeds can eventually lead to the growth of new plants that may produce pollen and cones, the fertilized egg itself does not directly turn into pollen or a cone. Therefore, the most accurate choice from the given options is (1) a seed, as it directly represents the next stage in the fertilization process."

['a liquid', 'a solid', 'a gas']	0		closed choice	grade4	natural science	physics	States of matter	Identify and sort solids, liquids, and gases	"Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.
When matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.
Some solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.
When matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.
Some liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.
When matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.
Many gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas."	"Gasoline is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.
If you pour gasoline into a different container, the gasoline will take the size and shape of that container."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Gasoline is classified as a liquid because it has a definite volume but no definite shape, allowing it to conform to the shape of any container it is placed in. This characteristic distinguishes liquids from solids, which have a fixed shape, and gases, which neither have a fixed shape nor a fixed volume. When gasoline is poured into a container, it flows and takes the shape of that container, confirming its liquid state. Thus, option (0) is the correct choice."

A cane toad is an example of an amphibian.	closed choice	grade3	natural science	biology	Classification	Identify mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians	"Birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians are groups of animals. The animals in each group have traits in common.
Scientists sort animals into groups based on traits they have in common. This process is called classification."	"A human is a mammal. It has hair and feeds its young milk.
Humans are a type of animal called a primate. Monkeys and apes are also primates.
A gray tree frog is an amphibian. It has moist skin and begins its life in water.
There are many kinds of tree frogs. Most tree frogs are very small. They can walk on thin branches."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I chose the gray tree frog because it is an amphibian, characterized by its moist skin and aquatic larval stage. In contrast, humans are mammals, which have different physical features such as hair and the ability to nurse their young with milk. Amphibians, including the gray tree frog, typically undergo metamorphosis from a water-dwelling larval form to an adult form, while mammals do not share this life cycle. Therefore, the correct choice that fits the description of an amphibian is the gray tree frog."
	Which is a compound sentence?	['In June, Jane and Rodrigo will graduate with honors from Georgetown High School.', 'The corridor in the basement was dark and damp, so Ariel put on a sweater and found a flashlight.']	1		closed choice	grade6	language science	grammar	Sentences, fragments, and run-ons	Is the sentence simple, compound, or complex?	"A clause is a group of words that contains both a subject and a predicate.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand alone as a sentence. A dependent clause is not a complete thought. It cannot stand alone as a sentence.
the oranges on our tree are ripe
The clause can stand alone. It is independent.
after we pick up Kevin from work
The clause cannot stand alone. It is dependent.
A simple sentence is made up of a single independent clause.
Ben and I spent all day relaxing by the pool.
Some simple sentences have introductory phrases, but the introductory phrase is part of the predicate.
In the winter, Ben usually wears his heavy coat.
Ben usually wears his heavy coat in the winter.
A compound sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a coordinating conjunction such as and, but, or, or so.
We saw a flash of lightning, and seconds later we heard the rumble of thunder.
A complex sentence is made up of an independent clause and a dependent clause. The dependent clause usually begins with a subordinating conjunction such as after, although, as, because, before, if, since, unless, until, when, or while.
If she ever gets the chance, Terri would love to visit the Egyptian pyramids."	"The second sentence is the compound sentence. It is made up of two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction so.
The corridor in the basement was dark and damp, so Ariel put on a sweater and found a flashlight."	"ANSWER: 1  
SOLUTION: A compound sentence consists of two or more independent clauses connected by a coordinating conjunction. In the second choice, ""The corridor in the basement was dark and damp, so Ariel put on a sweater and found a flashlight,"" there are two independent clauses: ""The corridor in the basement was dark and damp"" and ""Ariel put on a sweater and found a flashlight,"" linked by the conjunction ""so."" The first choice is a simple sentence with only one independent clause, hence it is not a compound sentence."
	Which closing is correct for a letter?	['Your Friend,\nBert', 'Your friend,\nBert']	1		closed choice	grade3	language science	punctuation	Formatting	Greetings and closings of letters	"A letter starts with a greeting and ends with a closing. For each one, capitalize the first word and end with a comma. You should also capitalize proper nouns, such as Aunt Sue.
Dear Aunt Sue,
I'm glad you could come to my party, and
thank you for the birthday gift. I could not have
asked for a better one! Every time I see it, I think
of you.
With love,
Rory"	"The first closing is correct:
Its first word is capitalized, and it ends with a comma."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: The first closing, ""Your Friend,"" is correct because it follows the conventional rules of capitalization in letter writing. The word ""Your"" is capitalized, which is standard for closings, and it ends with a comma, which is also a requirement. In contrast, the second option ""Your friend,"" uses a lowercase 'f,' which is incorrect according to standard letter writing etiquette. Therefore, the first closing is the appropriate choice."

Its scientific name is Hyla cinerea.	closed choice	grade8	natural science	biology	Classification and scientific names	Use scientific names to classify organisms	"Scientists use scientific names to identify organisms. Scientific names are made of two words.
The first word in an organism's scientific name tells you the organism's genus. A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.
A genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.
Together, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.
Both bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.
"	"A green tree frog's scientific name is Hyla cinerea. The first word of its scientific name is Hyla.
Hyla japonica is in the genus Hyla. The first word of its scientific name is Hyla. So, Hyla japonica and Hyla cinerea are in the same genus.
Macropus giganteus is in the genus Macropus. The first word of its scientific name is Macropus. So, Macropus giganteus and Hyla cinerea are not in the same genus.
Ardea cinerea and Hyla cinerea are not in the same genus.
These organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Ardea cinerea and Hyla cinerea have the same species name within their genus, cinerea. But the first words of their scientific names are different. Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea, and Hyla cinerea is in the genus Hyla."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: I selected Hyla japonica as the correct answer because it is in the same genus as the green tree frog, which is scientifically named Hyla cinerea. Both organisms share the genus name ""Hyla."" In contrast, Macropus giganteus belongs to a different genus, Macropus, and Ardea cinerea is in the genus Ardea, meaning neither of them shares the same genus as the green tree frog. Thus, Hyla japonica is the only appropriate choice."

Here are some properties of rocks:
They are solid.
They are formed in nature.
They are not made by living things.
They are not pure substances."	"Compare the properties of each substance to the properties of rocks. Select the substance whose properties do not match those of rocks.
Sandstone is a rock.
Dolerite is a rock.
Steel is made in a factory. But all rocks are formed in nature.
So, steel is not a rock."	"ANSWER: 0  
SOLUTION: Steel is not a rock because it is a manufactured material made in a factory, rather than a naturally occurring substance. In contrast, both dolerite and sandstone are types of rocks that are formed naturally. Dolerite, though not a pure substance, is formed from natural geological processes, while sandstone is a solid rock that also occurs in nature. Therefore, the correct choice that does not match the properties of rocks is steel."
