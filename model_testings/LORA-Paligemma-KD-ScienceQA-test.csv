"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 4:0 (2) 2:2 (3) 1:3 (4) 3:1
 Hint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:
The fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.
In a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=236x241 at 0x7BBC7ED161D0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.
A woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
A hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece."

The arrows in a food web represent how matter moves between organisms in an ecosystem."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=760x506 at 0x7BBC7ED16350>	"Primary consumers eat producers. So, in a food web, primary consumers have arrows pointing to them from producers.
The rotifer has an arrow pointing to it from the green algae. The green algae is a producer, so the rotifer is a primary consumer.
The copepod has an arrow pointing to it from the golden algae. The golden algae is a producer, so the copepod is a primary consumer.
The black crappie has arrows pointing to it from the water flea, the rotifer, and the shiner. None of these organisms is a produce, so the black crappie is not a primary consumer.
The bacteria have arrows pointing to them from the copepod and the shiner. Neither the copepod nor the shiner is a producer, so the bacteria are not primary consumers."

 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=244x241 at 0x7BBC7ED15C00>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.
Smooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.
Fuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit."

"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to a rat's intestine?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

A rat tapeworm is a type of flatworm that can live inside a rat's body. When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive.
The tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall. Inside the rat's intestine, the tapeworm absorbs nutrients from food that the rat has eaten. If the rat has many tapeworms in its intestines, it will become weak from lack of nutrients.
Figure: a tapeworm attached to the wall of an intestine."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=352x302 at 0x7BBC7ED15330>	"When a rat tapeworm attaches itself to a rat's intestine, the tapeworm gets nutrients that it needs to grow and survive. So, the tapeworm benefits from its relationship with the rat.
The rat loses nutrients from its food to the tapeworm. So, the rat is harmed by its relationship with the tapeworm.
Since the tapeworm benefits and the rat is harmed, a parasitic relationship is formed when a rat tapeworm attaches itself to the intestine of a rat."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a reddish-brown coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
Blossom is a horse from this group. Blossom has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene."		"Blossom's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Blossom's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Blossom's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Blossom's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mutualistic (1) commensal (2) parasitic
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

White sea urchins live in tropical oceans. Sea urchins are covered with hard, sharp spines. These spear-like spines protect the sea urchin from predators, such as fish. Sometimes a small worm, called a bristle worm, also uses the spines for protection.
The worm lives on the sea urchin, between the spines. To attack a worm on the sea urchin's body, a fish would have to get past the spines. When the worm lives on the sea urchin, the worm does not change the sea urchin's ability to survive.
Figure: a white sea urchin in the ocean."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=352x302 at 0x7BBC7ED14670>	"When a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin, the worm is protected from predators by the sea urchin's sharp spines. So, the worm benefits from its relationship with the sea urchin.
The sea urchin's ability to survive does not change when a worm lives on it. So, the sea urchin is not significantly affected by its relationship with the worm.
Since the worm benefits and the sea urchin is not significantly affected, a commensal relationship is formed when a bristle worm lives on a white sea urchin."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 2:2 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=246x241 at 0x7BBE88677FA0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.
A normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.
A dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having a graying coat (1) having a graying coat
 Hint: This passage describes the coat graying trait in horses:

In a group of horses, some individuals have coat graying and others do not. In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).
Dolly is a horse from this group. Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene."		"Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
Dolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 1:3 (2) 2:2 (3) 3:1 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of rabbits, some individuals have black fur and others have brown fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rabbits."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=244x241 at 0x7BBC6E7494E0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.
Black fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.
Brown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with black fur for every 1 offspring with brown fur."

"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bush growth (1) climbing growth
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype GG for the growth pattern gene."		"The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is GG. The rose plant's genotype of GG has only G allelles. The G allele is for climbing growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of GG has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 4:0 (2) 0:4 (3) 1:3 (4) 2:2
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have green pods and others have yellow pods. In this group, the gene for the pod color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two pea plants."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=248x241 at 0x7BBC7F2C7550>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.
Yellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.
Green pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a reddish-brown coat
 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a reddish-brown coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Sage is a horse from this group. Sage has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene."		"Sage's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Sage's genotype of ll has only l alleles.

The mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) chloride channel protein . . . CLCN1 gene (1) CLCN1 gene . . . chloride channel protein
 Hint: The following passage describes the effects of a gene mutation, which is a permanent change in a gene. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.

Muscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.
One of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.
A certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.
This different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it. The person with the mutation had muscles that were slow to relax, which resulted in muscle stiffness. Having muscle stiffness due to a mutation in the CLCN1 gene is called Thomsen disease.
Figure: muscles in the human body."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=192x272 at 0x7BBC7F2C51E0>	"A mutation in a gene may affect the protein it encodes.

"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the stem height trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a short stem (1) a tall stem
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have a tall stem and others have a short stem. In this group, the gene for the stem height trait has two alleles. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h).
A certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene."		"The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.
To check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) light fur (1) dark fur
 Hint: In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F).
Cleo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene."		"Cleo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Cleo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.

"Question: Based on this information, what is Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) not having agouti fur (1) having agouti fur
 Hint: This passage describes the agouti fur trait in cats:

In a group of cats, some individuals have agouti fur and others do not. In this group, the gene for the agouti fur trait has two alleles. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a).
Nabi is a cat from this group. Nabi has the homozygous genotype AA for the agouti fur gene."		"Nabi's genotype for the agouti fur gene is AA. Nabi's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for having agouti fur. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Nabi's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having agouti fur (A) is dominant over the allele for not having agouti fur (a). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Nabi's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Nabi's phenotype for the agouti fur trait must be having agouti fur."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) fuzzy leaves (1) smooth leaves
 Hint: In a group of summer squash plants, some individuals have fuzzy leaves and others have smooth leaves. In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L).
A certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ll for the leaf texture gene."		"The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is ll. The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for smooth leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.
To check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves."

"Question: Based on clues in the text, why would farmers have appreciated cats eight thousand years ago?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses. (1) The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers. (2) The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice. (3) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.
 Hint: Read the text about cats.
Cats are among the most popular pets in the world. Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.
People probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.
It wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.
Later in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!"	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=302x202 at 0x7BBC7F19F580>	"Think about these details from the text:
Grain attracted mice and other pests.
Cats were drawn to farms to hunt mice.
You may know that mice like to eat grain, and that this is a problem for farmers. If cats hunted the mice, that would help stop the mice from eating the grain.
Based on these clues, you can guess that farmers appreciated cats eight thousand years ago because the cats helped keep their grain free of mice."

"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle
dry ice sublimating and becoming a gas
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are chemical changes. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are caused by cooling. (3) Both are only physical changes.
 Hint: N/A"		"Step 1: Think about each change.
Loose matter such as sand and dirt is called sediment. Sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is a physical change.
The sediment sinks, and the water above becomes clearer. This separates the water from the sediment. But separating a mixture does not form a different type of matter.
Dry ice is solid carbon dioxide. When dry ice gets warm, it changes state and becomes carbon dioxide gas. This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.
Dry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Dry ice sublimating is caused by heating. But sediment settling to the bottom of a muddy puddle is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a spotted coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of jaguars, some individuals have a black coat and others have a spotted coat. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A).
Jupiter is a jaguar from this group. Jupiter has the homozygous genotype AA for the coat pattern gene."		"Jupiter's genotype for the coat pattern gene is AA. Jupiter's genotype of AA has only A allelles. The A allele is for a black coat. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Jupiter's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a spotted coat (a) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (A). This means A is a dominant allele, and a is a recessive allele.
Jupiter's genotype of AA has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Jupiter's phenotype for the coat pattern trait must be a black coat."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) rough fur (1) soft fur
 Hint: In a group of dachshund dogs, some individuals have rough fur and others have soft fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for soft fur (f) is recessive to the allele for rough fur (F).
Chester is a dachshund dog from this group. Chester has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene."		"Chester's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff.

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a red coat (1) a black coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l).
Moxie is a cow from this group. Moxie has the homozygous genotype LL for the coat color gene."		"Moxie's genotype for the coat color gene is LL. Moxie's genotype of LL has only L allelles. The L allele is for a black coat. So, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Moxie's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a red coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Moxie's genotype of LL has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Moxie's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a black coat."

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 2:2 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 0:4
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have horns and others do not. In this group, the gene for the horns trait has two alleles. The allele for having horns (h) is recessive to the allele for not having horns (H).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=248x241 at 0x7BBDD50EF6A0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.
Having horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.
Not having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.
So, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have horns."

 Hint: In a group of horses, some individuals have a black coat and others have a reddish-brown coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two horses."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=233x241 at 0x7BBDD50EFC40>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a reddish-brown coat or a black coat, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. The question tells you that the L allele, which is for a black coat, is dominant over the l allele, which is for a reddish-brown coat.
A reddish-brown coat is the recessive allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the recessive version of the coat color trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a reddish-brown coat must have the genotype ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ll. These boxes are highlighted below.
A black coat is the dominant allele's version of the coat color trait. A horse with the dominant version of the coat color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat color gene. So, offspring with a black coat must have the genotype LL or Ll.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype LL or Ll. These boxes are highlighted below.

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 0:4 (1) 2:2 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have red fruit and others have yellow fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit color trait has two alleles. The allele for red fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for yellow fruit (f).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=236x241 at 0x7BBDD4FF8640>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.
Yellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with yellow fruit must have the genotype ff.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.
Red fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit color gene. So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) straight fur (1) curly fur
 Hint: In a group of cats, some individuals have straight fur and others have curly fur. In this group, the gene for the fur type trait has two alleles. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F).
Precious is a cat from this group. Precious has the homozygous genotype FF for the fur type gene."		"Precious's genotype for the fur type gene is FF. Precious's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for straight fur. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Precious's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curly fur (f) is recessive to the allele for straight fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Precious's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, Precious's phenotype for the fur type trait must be straight fur."

"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) commensal (1) parasitic (2) mutualistic
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alpheid shrimp are small crustaceans that build burrows, or underground shelters, in the sand. Alpheid shrimp are blind and are vulnerable to predators when they are outside of their burrows.
A shrimp can share its burrow with a fish called a goby. The goby acts as a lookout for the blind shrimp. When the shrimp leaves the safety of the burrow, it touches its antennae to the goby's tail. If a predator comes near, the goby flicks its tail, alerting the shrimp to the danger. Both animals then retreat to the safety of the burrow.
Figure: a goby and an alpheid shrimp at the entrance of a burrow."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=352x302 at 0x7BBDD4FF8AC0>	"When an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby, the goby alerts the shrimp about nearby predators. These alerts help the shrimp survive. So, the shrimp benefits from its relationship with the goby.
The goby also receives protection from predators when it shares the shrimp's burrow. So, the goby also benefits from its relationship with the shrimp.
Since both the shrimp and the goby benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when an alpheid shrimp shares its burrow with a goby."
"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
a puddle freezing into ice on a cold night
beating an egg
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are chemical changes. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are caused by heating.
 Hint: N/A"		"Step 1: Think about each change.
A puddle freezing into ice on a cold night is a change of state. So, it is a physical change. Liquid water freezes and becomes solid, but it is still made of water. A different type of matter is not formed.

Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. No new matter is created.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are physical changes. They are not chemical changes.
Both are caused by heating.
Neither change is caused by heating.

"Question: Based on this information, what is this fly's phenotype for the wing type trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) normal wings (1) vestigial wings
 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:

In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
A certain fruit fly from this group has the heterozygous genotype Nn for the wing type gene."		"You need to determine the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait. First, consider the alleles in the fly's genotype for the wing type gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N). This means N is a dominant allele, and n is a recessive allele.
The fruit fly's genotype of Nn has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the fruit fly's phenotype for the wing type trait must be normal wings."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) brown eyes (1) red eyes
 Hint: In a group of guinea pigs, some individuals have brown eyes and others have red eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e).
Basil is a guinea pig from this group. Basil has the homozygous genotype ee for the eye color gene."		"Basil's genotype for the eye color gene is ee. Basil's genotype of ee has only e alleles. The e allele is for red eyes. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes.
To check this answer, consider whether Basil's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for brown eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for red eyes (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
Basil's genotype of ee has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Basil's phenotype for the eye color trait must be red eyes."

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 0:4 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the antenna type trait in fruit flies:
Most fruit flies have a pair of antennae on their head. But, some flies appear to have an extra pair of legs on their head instead! These flies have a mutation, or change, in a gene that affects body development. This mutation makes the cells in the fly's head form mutated antennae that are like legs.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have mutated antennae and others have normal antennae. In this group, the gene for the antenna type trait has two alleles. The allele for mutated antennae (A) is dominant over the allele for normal antennae (a).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=248x239 at 0x7BBDD4FF98A0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.
Mutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with mutated antennae for every 1 offspring with normal antennae."
"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the flower color trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) white flowers (1) red flowers
 Hint: In a group of scarlet rosemallow plants, some individuals have red flowers and others have white flowers. In this group, the gene for the flower color trait has two alleles. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f).
A certain scarlet rosemallow plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ff for the flower color gene."		"The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype for the flower color gene is ff. The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for white flowers. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers.
To check this answer, consider whether the scarlet rosemallow plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for red flowers (F) is dominant over the allele for white flowers (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The scarlet rosemallow plant's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the scarlet rosemallow plant's phenotype for the flower color trait must be white flowers."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a black coat (1) a red coat
 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have a black coat and others have a red coat. In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L).
Cheyenne is a cow from this group. Cheyenne has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene."		"Cheyenne's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a red coat. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat.
To check this answer, consider whether Cheyenne's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a red coat (l) is recessive to the allele for a black coat (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.
Cheyenne's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cheyenne's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a red coat."

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 3:1 (1) 0:4 (2) 2:2 (3) 4:0 (4) 1:3
 Hint: This passage describes the ear type trait in rats:
Some rats have dumbo ears, which are larger and rounder than normal ears. Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.
In a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rats."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=246x239 at 0x7BBDD4FFA140>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.
Dumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Normal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) a hairy body (1) a hairless body
 Hint: In a group of deer mice, some individuals have a hairy body and others have a hairless body. In this group, the gene for the body hair trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b).
Skippy is a deer mouse from this group. Skippy has the homozygous genotype bb for the body hair gene."		"Skippy's genotype for the body hair gene is bb. Skippy's genotype of bb has only b alleles. The b allele is for a hairless body. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body.
To check this answer, consider whether Skippy's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a hairy body (B) is dominant over the allele for a hairless body (b). This means B is a dominant allele, and b is a recessive allele.
Skippy's genotype of bb has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Skippy's phenotype for the body hair trait must be a hairless body."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) commensal (1) mutualistic (2) parasitic
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Hawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis.
Later, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated. After the moth pollinates the flower, the petunia is able to reproduce.
Figure: a hawk moth visiting a petunia flower."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=352x302 at 0x7BBDD4FFB040>	"When a hawk moth visits a petunia flower, the moth drinks nectar. The moth uses the nectar to survive and grow. So, the moth benefits from its relationship with the petunia.
The petunia flower is pollinated when the moth visits it. After the petunia is pollinated, it is able to reproduce. So, the petunia also benefits from its relationship with the moth.
Since both the moth and the petunia benefit, a mutualistic relationship is formed when a hawk moth pollinates a petunia flower."

"Question: Which organizational structure does this text primarily use?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) cause-effect (1) compare-contrast
 Hint: Read the text.
In 1968, when the Democratic Party held its convention in Chicago to select a presidential candidate, the United States was at war in Vietnam. Thousands of Americans and Vietnamese had died in the war, giving rise to a growing anti-war movement. President Johnson, a Democrat, declined to run for reelection, in part because of the heavy opposition to his conduct of the war. Just months before the convention, both Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy were assassinated, contributing to widespread unrest. Anti-war protesters wanted the Democratic Party to oppose the war, but they were excluded from the convention. This set off violent clashes between police and protesters on Chicago streets. The violence at the convention captured the nation's attention, strengthened the peace movement, and led to reforms in the nominating process."		The text uses a cause-effect structure to show the causes and effects of the violent demonstrations at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. In the text, certain words and phrases help to organize ideas in a cause-effect structure. Notice the phrases giving rise to, because of, contributing to, set off, and led to.

"Question: Based on this information, what is this plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) dull fruit (1) glossy fruit
 Hint: In a group of cucumber plants, some individuals have dull fruit and others have glossy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit sheen trait has two alleles. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f).
A certain cucumber plant from this group has the homozygous genotype FF for the fruit sheen gene."		"The cucumber plant's genotype for the fruit sheen gene is FF. The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has only F allelles. The F allele is for dull fruit. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit.
To check this answer, consider whether the cucumber plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for dull fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for glossy fruit (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
The cucumber plant's genotype of FF has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the cucumber plant's phenotype for the fruit sheen trait must be dull fruit."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 0:4 (2) 1:3 (3) 4:0 (4) 3:1
 Hint: In a group of koi fish, some individuals have red eyes and others have black eyes. In this group, the gene for the eye color trait has two alleles. The allele for red eyes (E) is dominant over the allele for black eyes (e).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two koi fish."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=246x235 at 0x7BBC6E7B96C0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.
Black eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene. So, offspring with black eyes must have the genotype ee.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.
Red eyes is the dominant allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red eyes."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) bush growth (1) climbing growth
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:

In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
A certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype gg for the growth pattern gene."		"The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is gg. The rose plant's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for bush growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth.
To check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.
The rose plant's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be bush growth."

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 4:0 (1) 3:1 (2) 1:3 (3) 0:4 (4) 2:2
 Hint: This passage describes the ground spot color trait in watermelon plants:
Watermelon plants grow with their fruit resting on the ground. Over time, the bottom of each fruit develops a white or yellow spot called a ground spot. In some types of watermelon plants, the color of the ground spot is an inherited trait.
In a group of watermelon plants, some individuals have a yellow ground spot and others have a white ground spot. In this group, the gene for the ground spot color trait has two alleles. The allele for a white ground spot (g) is recessive to the allele for a yellow ground spot (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two watermelon plants."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=250x239 at 0x7BBC6E7B9EA0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.
A yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.
A white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a white ground spot."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) yellow peas (1) green peas
 Hint: In a group of pea plants, some individuals have yellow peas and others have green peas. In this group, the gene for the pea color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e).
A certain pea plant from this group has the heterozygous genotype Ee for the pea color gene."		"You need to determine the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait. First, consider the alleles in the plant's genotype for the pea color gene. Then, decide whether these alleles are dominant or recessive.
The allele for yellow peas (E) is dominant over the allele for green peas (e). This means E is a dominant allele, and e is a recessive allele.
The pea plant's genotype of Ee has one dominant allele and one recessive allele. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the pea color trait must be yellow peas."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) curved whiskers (1) straight whiskers
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight whiskers and others have curved whiskers. In this group, the gene for the whisker type trait has two alleles. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H).
Stuart is a Syrian hamster from this group. Stuart has the homozygous genotype hh for the whisker type gene."		"Stuart's genotype for the whisker type gene is hh. Stuart's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for curved whiskers. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers.
To check this answer, consider whether Stuart's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for curved whiskers (h) is recessive to the allele for straight whiskers (H). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.
Stuart's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Stuart's phenotype for the whisker type trait must be curved whiskers."

"Question: Based on this information, what is Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) having Thomsen disease (1) not having Thomsen disease
 Hint: This passage describes the Thomsen disease trait in humans:

In a group of humans, some individuals have Thomsen disease and others do not. In this group, the gene for the Thomsen disease trait has two alleles. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m).
Elijah is a human from this group. Elijah has the homozygous genotype mm for the Thomsen disease gene."		"Elijah's genotype for the Thomsen disease gene is mm. Elijah's genotype of mm has only m alleles. The m allele is for not having Thomsen disease. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease.
To check this answer, consider whether Elijah's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having Thomsen disease (M) is dominant over the allele for not having Thomsen disease (m). This means M is a dominant allele, and m is a recessive allele.
Elijah's genotype of mm has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Elijah's phenotype for the Thomsen disease trait must be not having Thomsen disease."

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 2:2 (1) 0:4 (2) 1:3 (3) 3:1 (4) 4:0
 Hint: This passage describes the growth pattern trait in rose plants:
Climbing growth and bush growth are different growth patterns in rose plants. Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.
In a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=244x239 at 0x7BBC7ED999C0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.
Climbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
Bush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth."

 Hint: In a group of cows, some individuals have solid coloring and others have white spots. In this group, the gene for the coat pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for white spots (a) is recessive to the allele for solid coloring (A).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two cows."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=248x239 at 0x7BBC7ED181C0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.
White spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.
There are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.
Solid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.
All 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with solid coloring."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) mostly plain scales (1) mostly iridescent scales
 Hint: This passage describes the iridescent scales trait in bettas:

In a group of bettas, some individuals have mostly iridescent scales and others have mostly plain scales. In this group, the gene for the iridescent scales trait has two alleles. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i).
Poseidon is a betta from this group. Poseidon has the homozygous genotype ii for the iridescent scales gene."		"Poseidon's genotype for the iridescent scales gene is ii. Poseidon's genotype of ii has only i alleles. The i allele is for mostly plain scales. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales.
To check this answer, consider whether Poseidon's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for mostly iridescent scales (I) is dominant over the allele for mostly plain scales (i). This means I is a dominant allele, and i is a recessive allele.
Poseidon's genotype of ii has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Poseidon's phenotype for the iridescent scales trait must be mostly plain scales."

"Question: Which type of relationship is formed when an Alcon blue caterpillar lives in a Myrmica ant nest?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) parasitic (1) mutualistic (2) commensal
 Hint: Read the passage. Then answer the question.

Alcon blue butterflies spend the first part of their lives as caterpillars that live with Myrmica ants. When a caterpillar lives with the ants, it mimics, or pretends to be, an ant. The caterpillar can mimic the ants by copying their smell. The caterpillar can also make noises that make it sound like a queen ant. Queen ants receive more food and better protection than any other ants in the nest.
So, when the caterpillar mimics an ant, the ants feed and protect the caterpillar instead of other ants in the nest.

"Question: Based on this information, what is Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) wavy fur (1) straight fur
 Hint: In a group of Syrian hamsters, some individuals have straight fur and others have wavy fur. In this group, the gene for the fur texture trait has two alleles. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f).
Biscotti is a Syrian hamster from this group. Biscotti has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur texture gene."		"Biscotti's genotype for the fur texture gene is ff. Biscotti's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for wavy fur. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur.
To check this answer, consider whether Biscotti's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for straight fur (F) is dominant over the allele for wavy fur (f). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.
Biscotti's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Biscotti's phenotype for the fur texture trait must be wavy fur."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 2:2 (2) 3:1 (3) 0:4 (4) 4:0
 Hint: In a group of guppies, some individuals have a gray body and others have a golden body. In this group, the gene for the body color trait has two alleles. The allele for a golden body (b) is recessive to the allele for a gray body (B).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two guppies."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=246x241 at 0x7BBC7ED19540>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a gray body or a golden body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body color trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.
A gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the dominant version of the body color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body color gene. So, offspring with a gray body must have the genotype BB or Bb.
There are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype BB or Bb. These boxes are highlighted below.
A golden body is the recessive allele's version of the body color trait. A guppy with the recessive version of the body color trait must have only recessive alleles for the body color gene. So, offspring with a golden body must have the genotype bb.
There is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype bb. This box is highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with a gray body to offspring with a golden body is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with a gray body for every 1 offspring with a golden body."

 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) dark fur (1) light fur
 Hint: In a group of rock pocket mice, some individuals have dark fur and others have light fur. In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for dark fur (F) is dominant over the allele for light fur (f).
Boba is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Boba has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene."		"Boba's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Boba's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Boba's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.

"Question: What is the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings? Choose the most likely ratio.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) 1:3 (1) 4:0 (2) 3:1 (3) 2:2 (4) 0:4
 Hint: This passage describes the wing type trait in fruit flies:
Some scientists breed fruit flies to learn how traits are inherited. These scientists often use flies with vestigial wings, which are shorter and stubbier than normal wings. Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.
In a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).
This Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=248x235 at 0x7BBC7ED1A2C0>	"To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.
Vestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
Normal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.
There are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.
So, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings."

"Question: Think about the magnetic force between the magnets in each pair. Which of the following statements is true?
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2. (1) The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1. (2) The magnitude of the magnetic force is the same in both pairs.
 Hint: The images below show two pairs of magnets. The magnets in different pairs do not affect each other. All the magnets shown are made of the same material, but some of them are different sizes."	<PIL.PngImagePlugin.PngImageFile image mode=RGB size=484x168 at 0x7BBC7ED1A9E0>	"The magnets in Pair 1 attract. The magnets in Pair 2 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.
Magnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The larger the magnets, the greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.
Magnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is larger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 1 than in Pair 2."

"Question: What do these two changes have in common?
baking cookies
rust forming on a metal gate
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) Both are caused by cooling. (1) Both are caused by heating. (2) Both are only physical changes. (3) Both are chemical changes.
 Hint: N/A"		"Step 1: Think about each change.
Baking cookies is a chemical change. Cookies are made from cookie dough. Baking turns the cookie dough into cookies. The cookies are a different type of matter than the dough.
Rust forming on a metal gate is a chemical change. As the gate rusts, the metal turns into a different type of matter called rust. Rust is reddish-brown and falls apart easily.
Step 2: Look at each answer choice.
Both are only physical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.
Both are chemical changes.
Both changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.
Both are caused by heating.
Baking is caused by heating. But rust forming on a metal gate is not.
Both are caused by cooling.
Neither change is caused by cooling."
"Question: Which logical fallacy is used in the text?
I don't give tests to my students because good students will study the material regardless, and bad students won't study the material even for a test.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) false causation: the assumption that because two things happened together, one caused the other (1) false dichotomy: an argument that presents only two choices when more options exist (2) guilt by association: a negative association intended to discredit someone or something
 Hint: N/A"		The text argues that there are two types of students: good students who will study without the incentive of a test, and bad students who won't study even with the incentive of the test. However, this argument artificially restricts the types of students to just two extremes. For example, there may be some students who would study if they had a test, but who wouldn't study if they didn't have a test. This illustrates a type of logical fallacy known as a false dichotomy.
"Question: Complete the statement. Assume that the water balloon's mass did not change.
The gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth () as the water balloon fell toward Dale.
 Task: closed choice
 Choices: (0) decreased (1) stayed the same (2) increased
 Hint: Read the text about an object in motion.
Kimi dropped a water balloon off a balcony. The water balloon fell toward her friend Dale, who was standing below the balcony."		"Think about how the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth changed.
Dale was lower than the balcony. As the water balloon fell toward Dale, the distance between the water balloon and the center of Earth decreased. So, the gravitational potential energy stored between the water balloon and Earth decreased as the water balloon fell toward Dale."
